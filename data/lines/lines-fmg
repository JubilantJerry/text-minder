- Don't be that guy.
Oh, fine.
Why do all women have to look so good naked?
They don't all look good naked.
yeah.
They kinda do.
Hey, Jimmy.
Please.
Come over here.
- Hi.
I'm Summer.
- Hi, Summer.
- Anyone, uh, want a lap dance?
- Yes.
Yes, please.
I brought something.
Well, it can't be booze, and it can't be chocolate
- because I am not eating anything until after the wedding.
- No.
Oh, my god.
Are those tarot cards?
- I already did that.
- What?
!
Today I went to see a psychic.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
My grandmother used to read these cards to me.
She taught me everything I know, so...
- Do me.
- Okay.
Put your hand on the card, and now cut the deck.
Now take the top card.
Let me see.
Oh, the 9 of wands.
You're having a girl.
- You're next.
- No, I don't want to do it again.
- Come on, come on.
And cut the deck.
Now flip it over.
The ace of swords.
I got that same card this afternoon.
What did she say it meant?
Uh, she said that, um, that it meant that I had to give up on the possibility of other men?
- Like any bride?
- Hmm.
- What?
- Nothing.
No, it's just not what... you know, my grandma said it meant.
Well, I'm sure it has many meanings.
Right?
Well, what did your grandmother say?
It means betrayal.
- What's your girl's name?
- Marjorie.
- What does she do?
- She's a doctor.
Really?
I'm studying to be a chiropractor.
Really?
Nice, nice.
There's a good future in that.
- And what do you do?
- Uh, I'm a lawyer.
- Big lawyer.
- Big, big lawyer.
Lucky children you two are gonna have.
You're cute.
Yeah, so are you.
Gentlemen, feast youre yes on January on the main stage.
Well...
That's all, folks.
Yeah.
Here you go.
Ah, thank you very much.
So, uh, what's your name?
Uh, Summer's got to be your fake stripper name, right?
Right it's Eleanor.
- And Eleanor's your fake fake stripper name?
- Yes.
Listen, there's a private room in the back.
Private dance.
It's more money, but it's more fun, too.
Yeah, uh, I-I don't know.
All right.
Well, you think about it,
- and I will go and see if one is available.
- Okay
Should I do it?
- Hell, yeah.
- No, of course you shouldn't do it.
- Why not?
- Because you're getting married tomorrow.
Yeah, no thanks to you.
- What's your problem, Adam?
- What's your problem?
Well, what do you want from me?
Look, I
-I left.
I left for six months 'cause I didn't want to screw things up.
Okay, let's take it easy.
You think I wanted to fall in love with her?
You think I wanted to kiss her?
It just happened.
You kissed her?
She didn't tell you?
Apparently, she didn't tell me everything.
There's a room if you want it.
One more chance.
I wanted... to be awake when you got home.
- You like the...
- Mmm
- Candles?
- Mm-hmm.
Think Brian will make me give the dog back?
I think that if you wanted to keep Needle he would let you.
Well, with Ange gone, I feel safer with Needle protecting me.
He's so ugly, he scares the burglars away.
I missed Brian so much.
yeah, I missed him, too.
You think you're marrying the right guy?
Yeah.
Yeah, Adam's the right guy.
I'm not worried.
Those tarot cards aren't necessarily right.
Well, they were right tonight.
I am having a girl.
I haven't told anybody because...
Angelo wants to be surprised.
I have to go.
Okay.
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow's gonna be a great, great day.
I think it's out.
Music:
~ The Pretenders
- Brass in pocket ~
Got brass in pocket got bottle I'm gonna use it
Intention I feel inventive
You want to dance?
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice
Got motion restrained emotion been driving, Detroit leaning
No reason, just seems so pleasing
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice
Gonna use my arms Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style.
Gonna use my sidestep Gonna use my fingers...
Swept away by the wonder of it all so amazed...
What's going on?
You've been talking about second chances.
And I don't know where to turn
here and now seems I'm standing on the edge looking down.
I can clearly see your face in the crowd makes me feel I'm not alone
If I fall, will you catch me?
Make a sound and you die.
Hey, I need you to go to the hospital and interview a victim.
Uh, absolutely.
On my way.
Just let me grab a cup of coffee.
Morning, Maureen.
Morning.
What is it, insomnia?
Breast-feeding.
Breast-feeding?
Your kid's sleeping through the night.
Who are you breast-feeding?
Excuse me.
I'm trying to build up my breast-milk reserve, so I get up at night to pump.
Okay, first of all, we agreed to never discuss this subject again, and second of all, how long are you gonna keep this up?
Supplying nutrients and immunities to my baby?
As long as I can, Steve.
You're not gonna be one of those moms who breast-feeds their kid until they're or 12 or something, right?
Because that's creepy.
I'm not gonna be creepy and can we please add this to the list of conversations we won't be having?
Works for me.
The victim's name is Casey Wurth.
A guy forced his way into her home last night, raped and beat her.
Cops arrest anybody?
Not yet, but they will.
Brian Ford was released three weeks ago after serving time for raping two women.
Last night was right up his alley.
Home invasion, knife used to subdue the victim.
1412 Goren Place.
Four blocks from the crime scene.
And about a mile or so away from where I live.
You're gonna be seeing a lot those.
Interview the victim, then we'll go from there.
Okay.
Wouldn't want to be you today, pal.
}WURTH:
I had my key ready before I got to the door.
You're supposed to do that so you can get in the house as soon as possible.
I always did that.
Take your time, Casey.
He pushed me inside.
I guess he hit me, because I went down.
He kept hitting me.
I begged him to stop, but he wouldn't.
Did you recognize him?
It was dark.
I only saw a sliver of his face.
He was maybe six feet, dark brownish hair.
I could taste blood in my mouth.
It didn't seem real.
I could feel myself going out and I knew I wouldn't wake up.
But then I did and...
he was gone.
Casey, do you have any idea who might've done this to you?
Was anyone threatening you?
Old boyfriends?
No.
I'm sorry, I'm not helping.
( crying ):
Oh, you're not gonna be able to find him.
I'm gonna do everything
I can.
These hedges are pretty high.
Perfect place to lie in wait.
Do you think he was after her specifically?
I don't know.
She doesn't see anyone when she's coming up the sidewalk.
Gets to the door she's grabbed from behind.
Seemed like the guy was already there.
Stepped out of the shadows.
Any amount of force he used has already bought him an upgrade to a class A felony.
Lying in wait?
I could go for consecutive sentences.
When can we expect
DNA analysis on hair and fibers?
There are no hair and fibers.
No semen, either.
He must've used a condom.
Also wore gloves, so no fingerprints.
Guy's a pro.
This case is gonna come down to an ID.
But the victim has no idea who would've done this to her.
Her neighbors do.
Have you talked to them yet?
Got a unit over there right now.
Apparently he's claiming he was at the mall.
He did eight years for raping two women.
Yeah.
That's just not enough.
MAUREEN:
Can't find what you're looking for?
I forgot what I was looking for.
Do you need to go home and take a nap or something?
What I need is a pot of real coffee.
But I've already had my one cup for the day.
So, I'm fine.
Thank you.
You don't seem fine.
You seem kind of out of it.
I just spent the morning listening to a girl who was violated in unspeakable ways.
So, if I'm a little depleted emotionally,
I think that makes me human, right?
Excuse me.
Danny, I need a list of registered sex offenders living in a 20 miles radius of Casey Wurth's attack.
Also, get me whatever we have on Brian Ford, convicted rapist, recently paroled.
Brian Ford.
Got it.
No problem.
Just got a head's up.
There's gonna be a town meeting this afternoon about the guy on the flyers.
I told them you'd be there.
The last thing we need is villagers with torches running through the street trying to capture their own monster.
Just tell them that the prosecutor's office is investigating and let us do our job.
See what you can do to calm things down.
N o.
No, no, no, no.
You don't want me representing you at that meeting.
Why not?
Steve, I live around here.
I'm with the villagers on this.
I don't want a rapist living next door.
He has served his time.
According to the state of Indiana, he is a private citizen.
He is a repeat offender and he may have just brutally raped Casey Wurth.
Then you will prove that in a court of law and put him away.
Meanwhile, go to the meeting.
Don't let it get out of control.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
I'd like to make a suggestion on how we handle this rape case.
I'm all ears.
We're gonna have to move pretty quickly to stay ahead of public sentiment.
Annabeth's exhausted.
She'll be fine.
I'm not so sure.
Nobody forced her to come back to work.
If she wants to juggle a baby and a job, that's her business.
My mother used to say the definition of juggling is something's always falling.
Steve, we cannot afford a mistake on this.
So what do you want to do?
Take it away from her?
Maybe.
No.
All I'm saying is, maybe we're expecting too much from her right now.
And as her supervisor,
I'm concerned.
Part of managing people is knowing when to push them and when to let them figure things out for themselves.
Yes, but Steve...
She will be fine.
But you are now her supervisor, so feel free to supervise.
This is Danny Robel from the D.A.'s office.
I need all existing records on Brian Ford.
Uh, rap sheet, prison record, probation report.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Hello, everyone.
I'm George Roberts, Councilman for this district.
I live at 1517 Goren Place.
Yes, that's right.
The same street as Brian Ford.
So I'm very invested in keeping him under control.
Why don't they lock him up?
I'm going to let Officer Harmon answer that question.
At the moment, we have no evidence tying him to the crime.
MAN:
What's he doing in our neighborhood?
He should not be allowed to live among decent people.
I agree, sir.
But you're gonna have to change the laws.
Now, maybe the representative from the prosecutor's office could speak to that.
Ms. Chase, are you here?
Come here, sweetie.
I'm Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Annabeth Chase.
Officer Harmon is correct.
The laws allow Brian Ford to live wherever he wants as long as he registers as a sex offender and checks in with his parole officer.
But we're doing everything we can to figure out who committed the recent assault.
Brian Ford did it.
WOMAN:
That's right.
That's right.
We'll need to make that case, sir.
So we're supposed to wait for him to hurt somebody else?
I'm afraid to jog by myself in the morning or even take my dog to the park.
That's why we're here, right?
To organize a neighborhood watch.
I've been watching him since the day he moved in.
I saw on the Internet that he was being let out.
That's all anybody was doing, just putting the information on a website.
So I started following him.
He got away from me that night.
I mean, what are the odds that the one night I can't find him, him that girl gets raped?
We can't wait for law enforcement.
We've got to get rid of him.
MAN:
That's right.
Now, now be careful Don.
Be careful.
We'd hate to see you get into trouble.
No trouble at all.
In fact I've got my .45
out in the truck.
I'll be happy to go castrate the son of a bitch right now.
MAN:
That's the way!
I'm sorry, sir, what is your name?
Don Wheeler.
Mr. Wheeler, we're all a little upset, but I'm sure you don't mean to make threats in the presence of a police officer and a prosecutor.
MAN:
Why not?
Look, I live here, too, okay?
I want to feel safe, but we have to let the police and the courts do their jobs.
All right, all right.
We need to focus our energy.
I've got sign-up sheets for each block.
If we can organize a successful neighborhood watch, keep an eye on this guy 24 hours a day, maybe we can discourage him from even living here.
So, if you'll just step up and sign up we can get this program rolling right away.
All we need is your name, your address, your phone number and what hours you might be available.
I don't know who scares me the most:
Brian Ford or the guy who volunteered to castrate him.
If Brian Ford ever got near you, I'd kill him.
Jack.
He's been living less than a mile from us, okay?
And I had no idea.
And what would you have done if you'd known?
I don't know.
That's where he lives.
Look at those flowers.
Yeah, all he has to do is cut through a few yards, walk a couple of blocks.
We'll be okay, Jack.
You're damn right.
You're damn right we're gonna be okay, cause from now on, I'm keeping an eye on this guy.
You're starting to sound like Don Wheeler.
Well, he's got a point.
Look, I just, I don't want you getting all worked up and doing something stupid, okay?
It's not stupid to want to protect your family.
No, honey, of course not.
And it's not stupid to believe that rapists will rape again.
Let's go home.
K, Did you hear what happened to Brian Ford?
Yeah.
I'm on my way to the police station to hear his complaint.
Any word on his alibi the night of the rape?
Nobody ID'd him at the mall.
The police went store-to-store with his mug shot.
We need the surveillance tapes.
And you get the privilege of going through them all.
Look at me, I'm in a dream.
I got to go.
Nothing like listening to a convicted rapist whine first thing in the morning.
Get those tapes.
I had that car less than a month.
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Annabeth Chase, this is Brian Ford.
I want these people prosecuted.
They, they set my car on fire, they took a baseball bat to my windows.
Did you see who did it?
I didn't see their faces.
These people are crazy.
And I demand protection.
I am a United States citizen.
I have the right to feel safe.
We all have that right.
Unfortunately, some people don't respect it.
I didn't rape that girl.
I was at the mall.
We checked that out, Mr. Ford.
Nobody remembers seeing you there.
Well, that's where I was.
So you better start looking for somebody else and take those flyers down with my face on them or I will sue this city for all it's worth.
Send me a copy of his statement.
I'll look at it.
We don't have enough to arrest him.
Brian Ford fits the physical description.
You factor in his recent release, as far as I'm concerned, he's our guy.
The M.O.s are different.
They both used knives.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Okay, so where are we with this?
Brian Ford's prior attacks were considered power rapes.
He used a knife to control his victims, but he never cut them or beat them.
He tried to engage them in sexual fantasies.
And Casey Wurth?
Hers was a classic anger rape.
The assailant beat the hell out of her.
So the guy was angry.
Brian Ford's been locked up for the last eight years.
That'll piss a guy off.
You think Brian Ford changed his M.O.?
I think he wanted revenge and he got it on Casey Wurth.
We need to get him off the street.
Maureen, I have to make this stick in court.
I mean, I can't just go into a bail hearing and say, "We all just think it's him, Your Honor."
What do you need?
To do my homework, to widen the net.
I just want to make sure we get the right guy.
Okay, do it.
Okay.
Let's run possible likely and look-alikes in the area who fit the M.O.
Danny will check out Brian Ford's alibi.
ANNABETH:
We have received 250 calls today all asking why we have not arrested Brian Ford.
Yeah, about that-- bad news.
His alibi checked out.
He's caught on a security camera at the mall at 8:30 that night.
The rape occurred around 10:30.
That still gives him plenty of time.
Let's see what we have.
These are the 15 registered sex offenders in the radius.
Four of them don't fit the physical description, three are pedophiles and two have been missing for over a year.
DANNY:
Missing?
It happens.
Guys register and then leave the area.
Unfortunate flaw in the system.
That leaves these six.
They've all been out of prison for at least a year, and, to our knowledge, none of re-offended.
Greg Weiss, eight years for raping an elderly neighbor.
Doug Cronan, raped a 16-year-old girl across the street.
Alan Rayfield did ten years for the abduction and rape of a woman he worked with.
Now he says he was with his girlfriend the night of Casey's attack.
These guys have girlfriends?
Go figure.
Bill Nava, preyed on hookers.
Ed Young stalked and raped a nurse who reminded him of his mother.
Last but not least, Brian Ford.
Who now has a semi-believable alibi.
Which could be enough to confuse a jury.
The victim said she got a glimpse of him, right?
I'll put together a six pack of them and see if she can make an I.D.
Casey,
I'm about to ask you to do something very difficult, but I need you to concentrate and be honest.
Okay.
Casey, I want you to visualize your attacker.
I'm going to present you with a piece of paper showing six photos.
I'm not indicating whether your attacker's in there.
Do you understand?
Yes.
See if you recognize him.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hold on.
I think that's him.
STEVEN:
Number three?
Yes.
Are you sure?
You're under no obligation.
Yes.
Oh, my God, that's him.
That's the man who raped me.
Arrest him.
We got him.
We got him.
that Brian Ford be held without bond.
The victim picked him out of a photo array.
My client was identified because his face is plastered on flyers all over town.
The prosecution has no physical evidence, a security tape verifies my client's alibi.
I will have experts lined up around the block to argue mistaken I.D. and false memory.
You will have your chance, Mr. Drucker.
I'm holding Mr. Ford on one million dollars bail, but I'm giving Ms. Chase 72 hours to prove to me that he is a flight risk or a risk to community safety.
Next case.
Her victim's I.D. isn't going to be enough to hold this guy.
All right, put a rush on the lab results.
Let's see if anything comes back that matches Brian Ford.
Search his house.
Nothing gets by, okay?
I'll meet you there.
You got it.
Ms. Chase.
I brought you these.
What is it?
My surveillance reports;
photos, videos.
You can use them to put Brian Ford away.
Mr. Wheeler, what is going on here?
We're all concerned, but you seem to be taking it to another level.
Maybe I just have a lower tolerance for this kind of thing.
Your behavior is dangerously close to becoming criminal.
Now, you need to stop obsessing about this case and get back to your normal life.
I haven't had a normal life in five years.
Not since one of these creeps took my daughter from me.
I'm...
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
She was 14... walking home from school, and he grabbed her off the street, drove away with her.
She was missing for six days.
You know how long six days is?
I went on the news, pleading...
The whole time she was laying at the bottom of the Geist reservoir.
Somebody raped her... and strangled her... and threw her in the lake like she was some kind of trash.
Did they find him?
No.
No, the police said he probably just moved on to another town, another state.
There are plenty of lakes.
Mr. Wheeler, you understand
Brian Ford was in prison five years ago.
He couldn't have raped your daughter.
He raped somebody's daughter.
Got the lab results back from the crime scene.
Casey Wurth's blood, broken glass.
Was there glass in Brian Ford's car?
There was glass, but we couldn't make a positive match.
Of course, the fire didn't help.
So you find anything interesting?
A couple of changes of clothes in the closet, frozen dinners in the fridge.
Guy wasn't living large.
He likes TV.
Huh.
He highlights the TV listings so he won't miss his favorite shows.
And the flower garden.
What?
I don't know.
He's... he's got hobbies.
So?
So nothing.
Check his phone bill, see who his friends are, d talk to his cable company.
I want to know what he's watching and when.
I'll go back and take a look at Mr. Wheeler's so-called evidence.
You need help going through all that?
That's why God invented paralegals.
Mr. Wheeler put captions on the back of the photos.
He took notes.
Can you say "obsessive"?
Okay, so where do we stand?
Do we have enough for a trial?
I don't know.
I mean, I've handled a lot of rape cases, and there are certain behaviors you're going to see in repeat offenders.
I'm not seeing them.
And, look, he's not initiating contact with women, old girlfriends, girls on the street.
He's not calling sex lines, he's not watching porn.
Look at his cable bills.
He's catching up on his Adam Sandler movies.
You're looking for an obsession with sex.
You said yourself it was an anger rape.
Okay, but nothing we have on Brian Ford supports the profile of an angry guy.
He watches television, he seldom leaves the house.
When he does, he keeps his head down, he doesn't talk to people.
He made a flower garden for God's sake.
What are you saying?
His mug shot was plastered all over town, and maybe that is why she ID'd him.
I'm saying, Maureen, right now,
I could not convince a jury that Brian Ford raped Casey Wurth because I'm not convinced myself.
I'm saying we may be onto the wrong guy.
MAUREEN:
All right, then talk to the victim again.
Casey, I hate to ask you this, but I have to.
Are you absolutely sure
Brian Ford is the man who attacked you?
You don't believe me?
If he's the one, I will go after him with everything I have.
But if he's not, the defense will drive a hole through our case.
And, Casey, whoever did this to you will still be out there and will do it to someone else.
So I need you to think,
I need you to put yourself back there...
I don't want to put myself back there.
I want it all to go away.
I want to be able to walk into my house without breaking into a cold sweat.
I want to stop looking at the men on the street, imagining all the horrible things they're capable of.
I want to be able to sleep.
I can't sleep because I know he's there in the dark.
I see him over me, I... hear him.
I'm sorry.
( cries ):
It's him.
It has to be him.
It's him.
I'm sure.
It's him.
What's going on?
I'm going to pump.
Go back to bed.
Baby, it's 4:22 in the morning.
You got to get up soon.
It's okay, I need to do this.
You're going to burn out, honey, okay?
Haley's okay.
I don't want her to be okay.
I want her to be as healthy as possible.
I don't want her getting sick because I decided to go back to work.
Come here.
How are we supposed to do this?
Hmm?
Seriously, I mean...
what do we do when there's people out there like Brian Ford?
We look out for her.
We lock our doors and teach her to do the same.
And I go to work tomorrow and try to put the bad guys away.
(announcer) SPRINT'S NEW FAIto Casey Wurth, I slept on it.
I just don't think Brian Ford's our guy.
What do you mean, this isn't the guy?
The victim ID'd him.
This is the guy.
She needs him to be the guy, Steve.
There are a lot of sex offenders out there.
It could be any one of a hundred.
Then it's probably exactly who we think it is.
Annabeth's the one who has to argue it in court, and she doesn't feel she can make a case.
So let's figure out what we're going to do.
Well, I'll tell you what we're not going to do-- release Brian Ford before we've charged somebody else.
Town'll go crazy and I'll get another call from the D.A.
Okay, where were you before you zeroed in on Brian Ford?
We had five other likely suspects, but we never finished going over their alibis or cross-checking their histories against Casey Wurth's.
Bring them in.
Keep it quiet and make it quick.
You got 24 hours before you have to be back in front of a judge again.
Tell me about that night.
I already told you.
And now you'll tell me again.
My mother brought me dinner.
We watched Jeopardy.
That's our thing.
CRONAN:
I don't know anything about it, except I didn't do it.
I was at a card game.
And I got three buddies that'll tell you the same thing.
So the name means nothing?
Casey Wurth.
Come on, she's your neighbor, man.
You are aware that being at the track is a violation of your parole?
Annabeth.
Hey, Danny, what's up?
I got a hit.
Casey worked at a warehouse store a year ago with Alan Rayfield.
It's the same M.O. as the rape he was convicted for.
Great.
Mr. Rayfield?
This is Deputy Prosecutor Chase.
Open up.
Let's check around back.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
You're Alan Rayfield's girlfriend, right?
Could you tell us where he is?
I don't know, out of town?
I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Sunny.
Right.
Sunny, we need to find him right now, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where's Alan?
I don't know.
Wrong answer.
Take her in.
You brought in Rayfield's girlfriend.
Yeah, and I think she's covering for him.
You want me to handle it?
No, I can do it.
If we're gonna break this girl, things need to get very ugly very quickly.
Maureen, who are you talking to?
I am offering to help, so you don't feel like it's all on you.
It is all on me.
I have to find the right guy, and if she knows who that is, she's gonna tell me.
You can watch from the observation room.
If I'm not getting the job done, come on in.
No mercy.
ANNABETH:
How long have you been seeing Alan Rayfield?
Maybe six months.
You know he did time?
Sure.
You know why?
Yeah.
It doesn't bother you?
He's not like that with me.
You mean he doesn't stalk and rape you?
Do you know what he did to the girl he worked with?
I don't want to know.
You should know who you're sleeping with.
Who you're protecting.
I'm not.
You're lying for him, Sunny, we both know that.
He hid in her car.
Put a gun to her head, told her to drive.
Stop it, please.
He took her to the woods, raped and tortured her for seven hours.
Stop.
He had a girlfriend then, too, Sunny.
She tried to lie for him, just like you.
I think that girlfriend should have been tried as an accessory.
She as good as held down his victim while Alan raped her.
Is that what you're doing, Sunny?
Is your self-esteem so low, you think the only love you're ever gonna get is from a sexual predator?
Does he tell you he loves you?
Because he's not capable of that.
He has a 72% chance of re-offending.
Do you want him around your friends?
Your sister?
God forbid you ever have children.
He wasn't with you that night, was he?
Was he?
No.
I don't know where he was, but he wasn't with me.
I was just coming to see you.
They released you?
My brother posted bail.
He had to put up his business.
It's not appropriate for you to be...
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You made me a target.
You made yourself a target when you raped two women.
Now get out of my way.
No, no, no.
Listen to me.
Get your hands off of her.
Mr. Wheeler...
Are you nuts?
They never should have let you out.
Freeze!
Drop the weapon.
Put your hands over your head.
Mr. Wheeler...
I've got you covered.
Please... don't do this.
He's scum.
Put the gun down.
Don't ruin your life.
I don't have a life.
But I can do one good thing now.
I said drop the weapon.
Mr. Wheeler, please.
Give me the gun.
Please, give me the gun.
He deserves to die.
( ringing )
Annabeth Chase.
We spotted Rayfield at home.
Now?
Right now.
Okay, I'll get a warrant.
I'll meet you there.
OFFICER:
Alan Rayfield, you're under arrest for the rape of Casey Wurth.
Get your hands off of me!
We found these gloves.
They're caked with blood.
And he kept them?
Souvenir.
Excuse me.
Sure.
JUDGE:
Ms. Chase, I hope you're not pinning this case on another victim I.D.
That ship has sailed.
No, Your Honor.
We have concrete evidence of Alan Rayfield's guilt.
During the vicious attack on Casey Wurth, a lamp was broken and shattered on the floor.
We found broken glass embedded in a pair of Mr. Rayfield's shoes.
The glass was a match to the broken glass from the lamp at the crime scene.
The search of Mr. Rayfield's apartment also yielded gloves, which matched the description of the gloves used by Casey Wurth's attacker.
Initial tests show the gloves contain more than one person's blood.
I believe this evidence will allow us to solve not only this case, but other cases, as well.
Your Honor, this was a violent, torturous sexual assault.
This is Mr. Rayfield's second such assault, and we intend to prosecute him on all possible counts, to the full extent of the law.
We believe he is a flight risk, as well as a danger to this community.
And, therefore, the state is asking,
Your Honor, to hold him without bail until trial.
Granted.
What do you want?
Thirty.
How about 20?
Thirty minimum.
I like my chances with a jury.
I'll talk to him.
We did it.
We got him.
You did.
I hope you'll be able to sleep now.
Mr. Wheeler?
I heard you put in a good word for me.
You're being charged with a weapons violation and menacing.
But it's your first arrest.
I'm sure your lawyer will work something out.
I've been thinking about your daughter.
I'd like to reopen the case.
There have been a lot of advances in criminal forensics in the last five years.
I'd really like to take a shot, if that's okay with you.
I would appreciate that.
Hey, baby.
Hey.
What's with the beeping?
It's an alarm system.
Now, I don't mean to scare you,
I just figured...
Hey... you okay?
Hey, something wrong?
I'm fine now.
Is Haley asleep?
Yeah.
I gave her a bottle;
she went right off.
Thank you.
I'm going to put this stuff away, and I'll meet you upstairs.
Everything starts somewhere, although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where, where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle the great A'tuin.
It was sometime after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories at the beginning are sooner or later about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis:
things just happen, what the hell.
And so our story begins in Ankh-Morpork the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork the biggest city in Discworld.
A city, where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets.
Our story begins on a mid-winter festival very remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
And so... it was the night before Hogswatch.
...and then Jack chops down what's the world's last beanstalk adding murder and ecological terrorism to the theft, enticement and trespass charges already mentioned, and all the Giant's children didn't have a daddy anymore.
But he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done.
Which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you're a hero because noone asks inconvenient questions.
And now, it's time for bed.
- Susan!
- Yes?
You know last week we wrote letters to the Hogfather?
- Yes?
- Well, did he really got them?
And when's he coming here?
Does it matter, if you get the presents anyway?
Yes.
Well, if you don't believe in the Hogfather, there won't be any presents.
Thought so.
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly, fat man is about to deliver their presents,
not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit.
Especially in a city where there is a guild for everything.
Khm!
The doors are locked, the windows are barred the dog does not appear to have woken up
the squeaky floorboards haven't.
I really doubt that you are a ghost and gods, generally, do not anounce themselves so politely.
You could, of course, be Death, but I don't believe he bothers with such niceties.
Besides, I am feeling quite well.
Good evening.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
Our scale of fees...
The payment will be three million dollars.
No questions asked, I assume.
No questions answered.
We need to know your name, or names, in strict client confidentiality, of course.
You may think of us as the Auditors.
Really?
What do you audit?
Everything.
We maintain the logical order of the Universe.
We need to know a little more than that.
We are the people with three million dollars.
We need to know when, where and, of course, who.
The location is not on any map, and we need the task to be completed by sunrise tomorrow.
This is essential.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
But won't he be out on his round?
Ho, ho, ho!
How would the Fat Man be inhumed?
A glass of poisoned sherry, perhaps?
You find the ways and means.
How can I contact you?
We will contact you.
We know where you are.
We know where everyone is.
Winvoe, is Mr. Teatime still in the building?
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up Tusker!
Up, Snouter!
Giddyup!
Go away!
I don't do that stuff anymore.
Yes, Twyla?
I'm afraid of the monster in the cellar, Susan.
It's going to eat me up.
What, again?
Ye gawds, there's a gel out here with a poker!
What are you doing?
Twyla said she's afraid of the monster in the cellar, Mrs. Gaiter.
- And you're going to attack it with a poker, eh?
- Yes.
Susan's our governess.
She beats up monsters with a poker?
Actually, it's a very clever idea.
My daughter gets into her head there's a monster in the cellar.
You go in with the poker and make a few bashing noises while the child listens, and then everything is all right!
Is that what you're doing, Susan?
Yes, Mrs. Gaiter.
This I've got to watch, by Io!
Not everyday you see monsters beaten up by a gel!
Come in, Mr. Teatime!
Ah, Carter, just put it on the table over there, will you.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry sir, I'll go and fetch under cup directly, sir.
- What?
- Your visitor, sir.
What visitor?
Oh, for when Mr. Tea-
Mr. Teatime?
It's pronounced Te-ah-tim-eh, sir.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with animals, sir.
I have a report... here that says that you've nailed Sir George's dog to the ceiling.
I couldn't have it barking while I was working, sir.
Some people would have drugged it.
Oh!
But I definitely fulfilled the contract.
I checked Sir George's breathing with a mirror, as instructed.
Apparently his head was several feet from his body at that point.
That was all right, wasn't it, sir?
It...
lacked elegance.
Ah, thank you sir!
I'm alwas happy to be corrected.
I shall remember that next time.
It is about the next time that I wish to talk.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
You don't have to worry.
She always wins.
Very well done!
Very persykological.
A clever idea, that bend in the poker.
I expect you're not afraid anymore, eh, my girl?
- No.
- Very persykological.
Susan says, don't get afraid, get angry!
Er, thank you, Susan!
And now, if you'd all like to come back to the parlour
- I mean, the drawing room.
Dashed convincing, the way she bent the poker like that.
- Have they all gone, Twyla?
- Yes, Susan.
Good.
That's what we do to monsters.
Now, it's back to bed for you, my girl.
- Difficult, sir.
- Certainly.
But I have devoted some time to it, sir.
You mean you've actually sat down, and thought out how to inhume the Hogfather?
Oh, yes, sir.
And the Soul Cake Duck.
And Death, sir.
I suppose I just see things differently from other people.
We maybe able to see the complaint of Sir George's estate against you with regard to his dog rather differently
and approve your graduation to full membership of the guild
Take the dark, sir?
By black, sir?
If you agree to undertake this contract.
With due elegance, of course.
With elegance guaranteed, sir.
Er, Mr. Teatime?
You have actually applied yourself to a study of ways of killing Death.
Everyone has their weak point, sir.
Susan, there's a monster under my bed, again.
Do the Voice on it!
Do the Voice on it!
No!
Not the Voice!
- Hit it on the head with the poker!
- Not the poker!
This is a friendly warning, understand, because it's Hogswatch.
What are you?
A witch, or something?
I'm just... something.
Now, you won't be around here again, will you?
Or we'll put your head under the blanket.
It's got fluffy bunnies on it.
Fluffy bunnies, no!
GO AWAY, AND STOP BOTHERING ME!
That wasn't as much fun as the one last month you know, the one when you've kicked him in the trousers.
Just go to sleep now!
's gone six.
He's not coming.
Good evening.
Do I have another drink while we wait for the other members of our little ...troupe.
- Locks.
- We have a locksmith.
- Who?
- Mr. Brown.
And you can help me carry this.
It's rather heavy.
That's a wizard!
- No, I'm not.
I'm incognito.
- Yeah, right.
Mr. Sideney here is indeed a wizard.
A student, anyway.
This is my brother, Banjo, this is Chickenwire.
I didn't want to come.
Mr. Sideney is down on his luck at the moment.
Hence his willingness to join our little venture.
What is this?
Does it do tricks?
- It looks like a volcano!
- Really?
And I suppose we might as well make a start.
Hello, my name is Violet.
And I have been your tooth fairy for this evening.
There ain't nothing valuable, y'know!
- Nothing valueable, only a few bags of... t-t- t-t...
- Teeth.
I know.
My name's Teatime.
What's your name, sir?
Ernie.
Yes, Ernie.
Come on, gentlemen!
This is my friend, Ernie.
He's going to be our drive for tonight.
Put her in the back, Banjo!
Mister, I ain't allow to carry passangers, y'know.
Charlie'll give me a right telling-off.
Don't you worry about that.
We're all friends here.
Our Mom said no hitting girls.
Only bad boys do that.
Our Mom said...
Shut it.
- Shhhh!
- Where to, Mister?
You know the way, Ernie.
Behind the Unseen University.
Where the students of magic are still hard at work on the night before Hogswatch.
It's just a shame we don't have any radiation shielding, Bursar.
You want radiation shielding, Mr. Stibbons?
Advice from Hex, Bursar.
As the University won't supply our student an atomic particle accelerator, we started to build our own.
Safety first!
Dean, have you seen the Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic?
I need some urgent advice!
Well, ask the Chair of Indefinite Studies.
- Lecturer in Recent Runes?
- Well, you see, it all depends...
I don't know.
In my day, when I was undergraduate I wouldn't have been studying on Hogswatch night.
That's just not natural.
I'd have been sick twice by now.
Bursar!
Bursar.
Then Dean.
Oh, there you are!
Archchancellor!
Members of the faculty!
I've decided, as a Hogswatch present to myself, to open up the late Archchancellor Weatherwax's old bathroom.
So I don't have to sluice down with you fellas.
It's unhygienic.
You can catch stuff.
Here, I can't take the lot of you throught the wall.
Listen, Ernie.
Ernie, you will take us through, or, and I say that with very considerable regret,
I'll have to kill you.
But if I take you through...
What's the worst thing that can happent?
You lose your job.
Whereas if you don't, you'll die.
Really, Mustrum.
I think this is most unwise.
It said in the plans it was a bathroom.
You chaps are all acting as if the room was some kind of torture chamber.
Bathroom, designed by Bloody Stupid Johnson.
Yeah, the late Bergholt Stuttley Johnson was the worst inventor in the world, Archchancellor.
Not everything he made had a horribly fateful flaw.
Think of the thing they are using in the kitchen for peeling potatoes, for example.
You mean the thing with the brass plate on it saying:
'Improved Manicure Device'?
It's only water.
Even old Johnson can't do too much harm with water!
Go to it, lad.
You just chucks it at the wall there, and it goes twing.
Really?
May I try?
- Ah, Isn't that nice, eh, our Davey?
- Yeah.
And then you just drive forth?
Oh, yeah, right.
Quick, mind, 'cause it only stays open a little while.
Thank you very much, Ernie.
Very much, indeed.
Wasn't he dull?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
The Tooth Fairy, huh?
Another childish belief.
- Exactly.
Very elegant.
- It is.
You have to start somewhere.
Once you have their little minds in your grip, it's good bye, Hogfather!
It's him!
COULD I GIVE YOU A HAND?
Cor, yeah!
Here, your fingers are cold, mister!
SORRY.
What'd he go and do that for?
I did what he said.
Could have killed me!
YES.
I always keep a nip on me these cold nights.
Keeps me spirits up.
INDEED.
How'm I going to explain all this, then, eh?
SORRY?
THAT WAS VERY RUDE OF ME, I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.
I said what'm I going to tell people?
Letting some blokes ride off with my cart neat as you like.
That's gonna be the sack for sure!
THERE AT LEAST I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS, ERNEST.
AND, THEN AGAIN, I ALSO HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.
So, I'm dead then.
CORRECT.
NOW TELL ME ABOUT THESE BLOKES WHO STOLE YOUR CART.
AND KILLED YOU.
Honestly, Death gets worse than worse.
He seems to like humans.
So illogical.
But the beauty of the assassin's plan is that he can't interfere.
But Death can go everywhere.
No.
Not quite everywhere.
Great job...
Hello.
My name's Teatime.
What's yours?
ALBERT.
SOMETHING HERE IS NOT RIGHT.
Awk!
Too right.
This is the mythological persons' room.
How come one of them die?
SOUL CAKE DUCK.
THE TOOTH FAIRY.
THE HOGFATHER.
OH, DEAR.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
ALBERT?
WE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.
I don't know what you're expectinging me to say, but...
Shhh!
Questions first.
Babble later.
Now, Miss Bottler.
I'd like you to think of me as a friend.
How're we doing, Mr. Modo?
The tanks are full, and I've stoked the boilers, Mr Archchancellor, sir!
You can't read the signs on that door, Ridcully?
You mean the sign that says, 'do not under any circumstances open this door'?
Surely, it was sealed up for a reason.
They just wrote that to keep people out.
That's right.
That's what people do.
Don't say I didn't warn you!
Hygiene!
That's the ticket.
I still haven't worked out where all the pipes lead.
We'll find out.
Don't you fear.
Man the pumps, Mr. Modo!
Or dwarf them, of course, in your case.
She's a tooth fairy.
But she's not THE Tooth Fairy.
Shhh!
What did you expect in the Tooth Fairy's castle?
T'is just the creepiest thing I've ever...
You don't have to think.
You just have to do what I've said.
- All of them?
- Every last one.
- Put 'em in a pile?
- That's millions.
Mr. Brown.
I want you to unlock every door you can find.
What's this really all about?
Does he believe in things like the Soul Cake Duck?
The Sandman?
The Tooth Fairy?
Yeah.
Even the Hogfather.
'Cause after we're finished here, not even he will.
ONWARDS, BINKY, TO THE HOGFATHER'S CASTLE OF BONES.
First Hogswatch off in thousand years!
Even if I'm going to have the mother of all hangovers in the morning.
And how can the Hogfather bring you the presents to all at the same time?
Unless there are lots of Hogfathers.
- Look, you've always believed in the Hogfather, yes?
- Yes...
Well, if you don't believe in him, he won't come down the chimney.
It's a very small chimney.
And a very small stocking if you don't go to sleep!
...SOOT...
PORKPIE...
OH, YES.
AND...
HO, HO, HO.
There's a tap in there marked 'Old Faithful'... which I think, perhaps, we might leave alone for now.
This is a most perculiar Hogswatch.
Any mustard?
They're a treat with mustard.
APPLESAUCE.
I'M FINDING THE BEARD A BIT OF A TRIAL.
Well, at least it's keeping you in the right frame of mind, master.
In character, sort of thing.
BUT GOING DOWN THE CHIMNEY?
WHERE'S THE SENSE IN THAT?
It's got to be chimneys.
A bit like the beard, really.
D'you think these little buggers'd be writing to someone who could walk through walls if they knew?
Oh, that reminds me.
The 'Ho, ho, ho' could use some more work, if you don't mind me saying so.
HO, HO, HO?
No, no, no!
No, you got to put a bit more life in it, sir.
No offense intended.
You gotta got to be a big, fat laugh, sir.
You know, like... ho-hoo, ho, ho, ho, ho!
, see?
You got to sound like you're pissing brandy and crapping plum pudding, sir.
If you pardon my Klatchian.
REALLY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?
Well, I used to be young meself once, sir.
Surprising as it may seem.
The teeth give me the creeps.
Just keep going!
Why do we pile them all up?
You don't wanna know.
The quicker all the teeth are in the pile, the quicker we are out of here with our money.
No one ever laid a punch on Banjo since our Mom died.
Tough but fair, huh?
You know, I recall that time she strangled Glossy Ron with his own leg.
Yeah.
Maybe the both of us could creep up on him and...
Yeah!
I keep thinking of that glass eye watching me.
I keep thinking it can see right in my head.
Don't worry, he doesn't know what you're thinking.
Well, how do you know?
You're still alive.
These damn eyeballs are hard, aren't they?
They're walnuts, not eyeballs.
I don't want you back in my life, understand?
Don't say you've never been warned.
Warned?
Did you check the list?
COULD NOT REALLY MAKE HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
I DON'T NORMALLY CARE IF THEY'VE BEEN NAUGHTY OR NICE.
I CAN FEEL BELIEF IN THE HOGFATHER FADING.
What's that?
IT LOOKS VERY BAD.
No, no, it's just there's some nibling it, that's all.
I MEAN THE SITUATION.
I FEAR WE MAY BE TOO LATE.
Never say die, master.
That's our motto.
I CAN'T SAY IT'S EVER REALLY BEEN MINE.
You'd better watch out!
Because if the Hogfather still comes to town, as a result of a magical misjudgement on your part, then you'd no longer be my friend, Mr. Sideney.
I understand, sir.
Do you have a lot of friends, Mr. Sideney?
Well, quite a few, actually.
I don't have many.
Don't seem to have the knack.
On the other hand...
I don't seem to have any enemies at all.
It's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
- That is, very subtle.
And will make the pile of teeth very...
- Mr. Teatime!
...dangerous.
Grandfather, this is Hogswatch.
It is supposed to be jolly, with mistletoe and holly.
And other things... ending in -olly.
It's a time when people are meant to feel good about things and eat until they explode.
A time when they want to see all their... relatives.
I mean it's a time when humans are really human.
And they don't want... a skeleton at the feast.
Especially one, I might add, who is wearing a false beard, and has got a damn cushion shoved up his robe.
I mean, why?
ALBERT SAID IT WOULD HELP ME GET INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE THING.
This is a real job.
And I was looking forward to a real Hogswatch, when normal things happen, with normal people, in a normal house.
And suddenly, the old circus comes to town!
Well, I don't know what's going on, but you can just leave, right now.
- Albert!
- Bugger it.
Master, I'm stuck.
The pixie.
Oh, come along in, do!
If the real Hogfather doesn't turn up soon there's not going to be enough room for him.
HE WON'T BE JOINING US.
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons, I will add, then that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
THE HOGFATHER IS UNAVAILABLE.
- At Hogswatch?
- YES.
Why?
HE IS...
LET ME SEE...
THERE ISN'T AN ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE HUMAN WORD, SO...
LET'S SETTLE FOR...
GONE.
YES, HE IS GONE.
How can the Hogfather be gone?
He's... isn't he what you are?
Anth...
ANTH-RO-PO-MOR-PHIC PER-SON-IF-IC-A-TION.
YES.
HE HAS BECOME THE SPIRIT OF HOGSWATCH.
And while he's gone you've taken over.
That's sick.
I SEE THE GIRL WRITES IN GREEN CRAYON ON PINK PAPER
WITH A MOUSE IN THE CORNER.
THE MOUSE IS WEARING A DRESS.
I ought to point out that she decided to do that so the Hogfather would think she was sweet.
Including the deliberate bad spelling.
But look, why are you doing the-
SHE SAYS SHE IS FIVE YEARS OLD.
Seven.
In cynicism, she's about thirtyfive.
But why are you doing the-
BUT SHE BELIEVES IN THE HOGFATHER?
She'd believe in anything if there was a dolly in it for her.
But you're not going to leave without telling me-
And what are you doing here, Albert?
I thought you'd die if you ever came back to the world.
AH, BUT WE ARE NOT IN THE WORLD.
WE ARE IN THE SPECIAL CONGRUENT REALITY CREATED FOR THE HOGFATHER.
NORMAL RULES HAVE TO BE SUSPENDED.
HOW ELSE COULD ANYONE GET AROUND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN ONE NIGHT?
That's right.
I'm one of the Hogfather's Little Helpers, me.
It's official.
I'v got the little pointy green hat with a bell, and everything.
Have you been good, have you?
NOW, WE MUST BE GOING.
HAPPY HOGSWATCH!
AND, OH YES.
HO, HO, HO.
It's a nice drop of sherry, this.
You've actually been drinking the actual drinks little children leave out for the actual Hogfather?
Yeah, why not?
He won't be drinking anymore, will he?
Not where he's gone.
How many have you had, may I ask?
Dunno.
Haven't been counting.
ONE MILLION, EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND, SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIX.
AND SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND, THREE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN PORK PIES.
AND ONE TURNIP.
Well, It looked pork-pie shaped.
Everything does, after a while.
Why are you doing this?
I AM SORRY.
I CANNOT TELL YOU.
FORGET YOU SAW ME.
IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS.
Not my business?
How can you say-
YOU WANTED TO BE NORMAL.
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDDAUGHTER.
Sleep tight!
Better watch out... pardon.
We're running out of doors.
I hope this is the one.
This isn't the room we're looking for.
Just teeth in here.
Keep going, Mr. Brown.
Susan will try to find out what this is all about, you know.
OH, DEAR.
Especially after you've told her not to.
- YOU THINK SO?
- Oh, yes.
DEAR ME, I STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT HUMANS, DON'T I?
Well, I dunno.
OBVIOUSLY, IT WOULD BE QUITE WRONG
TO INVOLVE A HUMAN IN ALL THIS.
THAT IS WHY, YOU WILL RECALL,
I CLEARLY FORBAD HER TO TAKE AN INTEREST.
Yes, you did.
BESIDES, IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.
Yes, that's a shame, really, because she likes to break them, doesn't she?
YOU MIGHT THINK I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT,
BUT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT.
AND WE HAVE MUCH TO DO.
WE HAVE THE HOGFATHER'S PROMISES TO KEEP.
He did something to the real Hogfather.
Binky.
Can't she be eliminated?
Oh, yes.
She's mostly human.
Oh, good.
Then can we go back to just concentrating on running the Universe?
Making sure that gravity works and that atoms spin.
Yes, when there is not an atom of belief left in the world.
And the Hogfather is just the beginning.
What are you looking for, Mustrum?
My father always said that where you get lots of people bathing together, the Verruca Gnome is running around with his little sack.
Modo, any sign of the Verruca Gnome down there, old boy?
Welcome home, Susan.
You toook your time.
I don't do family reunions.
The Sandman.
Soul Cake Duck.
Tooth Fairy...
The Hogfather.
Grandfather, what have you done?
THIS CUSHION IS STILL UNCOMFORTABLE.
You're doing well, master.
Soot in the fireplaces, footprints, swigged cherry.
The sleightracks all over the roofs.
It's got to work!
YOU THINK SO?
Oh, yeah!
Here's a little tip, though. 'Ho, ho, ho' will do.
Don't say, 'Cower, brief mortals'!
OH, REALLY?
SO MANY CHIMNEYS.
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH QUICKER IF I LOST THE CUSHION.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, if we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
No, I mean the Hogfather.
So, you got to look the part, master.
I tell you what would be really good to boost belief.
A public appearance!
I DON'T NORMALLY DO THEM.
But the Hogfather is more of a public figure, master.
I tell you what, one good public appearance'll do more good than any amount of letting kids see you by accident.
REALLY?
And I know just the place.
Thank you very much.
Everything going well, Mr. Parson?
Yes, Mr. Crumley.
Jolly good.
LET'S GO, SLEIGH THEM.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, ALBERT,
BUT THAT WAS A PUNE, OR PLAY ON WORDS.
Ho, ho, ho, sir.
Stop that!
Stop that!
You're frightening the little kiddies!
Wow, they've got tusks!
Cool!
Hey, look, that one's doing a wee!
It's the Campaign for Equal Heights that've done this, isn't it!
They're out to ruin me!
That's it!
I don't mind the smell of oranges and the damp trousers but I ain't putting up with this.
And he's not even doin' it right!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
Come on!
Who are you?
You can call me Uncle Heavy.
You're not a pixie!
Nah, I'm a fairy cobbler, mister!
Quiet!
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR HOGSWATCH, SMALL HUMAN?
They're autobiographies, writing down everything that happens to you, as it happens.
I know.
I used to live here, remember?
But I can't read this.
The letters are all... odd.
So, I suppose, now you'll be wanting my words of occult wisdom.
Ethereal runes.
The Hogfather is not human, after all.
I suppose a bit of warm liver is out of the question?
On the second day of Hogswatch, I sent my true love back
A nasty little letter, and a partridge in a pear tree.
What's the game then?
Small-time thief, are you?
You ain't supposed to be able to see me!
I'm a wizard!
We can see things that are really there, you know.
What's in this bag?
You'll really wish you hadn't, mister.
Will I?
What're you doing here, young man?
Well, you know the Tooth Fairy?
It's sort of like the same business.
What?
You take things away?
Not take away, as such.
More sort of bring.
Ah...
like new teeth.
Like new verrucas.
I saw your piggie do a wee.
OH.
ER...
GOOD.
It had a great, big...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR HOGSWATCH?
She wants a-
I want an army.
And a big castle with an active drawbridge.
And a sword.
They're supposed to say thank you.
ARE YOU SURE?
PEOPLE DON'T, NORMALLY.
No, I meant to the Hogfather, which is you, right!
Sorry.
YES, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY THANK YOU.
'enk you.
AND BE GOOD.
THIS IS PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT.
Yes.
THEN WE HAVE A CONTRACT.
Verrucas, eh?
Wish I knew why!
You mean you don't know?
No.
Suddenly I wake up and I'm the Verruca Gnome.
Strange.
Anyway, amazing bathroom, ain't it?
It's got a special pot for your toenail clippings.
A special pot for toenail clippings?
Oh, can't be too careful.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clipping, hair, teeth...
You got them under your control.
I mean, that's real old magic.
Children of the world, prepare to take a short tour.
Mr. Sideney!
Your big, no-misjudgements magic moment.
You can't give her that!
That's not safe.
IT'S A SWORD.
THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE SAFE.
She's a child!
IT'S EDUCATIONAL.
What if she cuts herself?
THAT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT LESSON.
REALLY?
OH, WELL.
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO ARGUE, I SUPPOSE.
And she doesn't want all that other stuff.
She's a girl!
And anyway, I can't afford big posh stuff like that.
I THOUGHT I GAVE IT AWAY.
- You do?
- You do?
You don't!
That's our Merchandise!
You don't just give it away!
Hogswatch isn't about giving everything away!
I mean, yes, you do give things away, but you have to buy them first!
You mean this is all free?
It... would seem to be.
So, Mr. Stibbons.
This thing is a great, big artificial brain, then.
You could think of it like that.
Of course, Hex doesn't actually think.
Not as such.
It just appears to be thinking.
Amazing.
You mean it gives the impression of thinking, but really it's just a show.
Er, yes.
So it's like everyone else, then.
I knew I'd come here for something.
Now, this here chappie is the Verruca Gnome.
Who's just popped into existence to be with us on Hogswatchnight.
The most magical night of the year.
Last year's occult rubbish piling' up.
I just thought you fellows might check up on this.
Verruca Gnome?
Makes about as much sense as anything else, doesn't it?
After all, there's a Tooth Fairy, ain' there?
Makes on wonder why there's a God of Wine and not a God of Hangovers?
Anyone hear that noise just then?
Sorry, Archchancellor?
Sort of glingleglingleglingle?
Like a lot of tinkly bells?
Didn't hear anything like that, sir.
Oh.
Well, where was I?
So, no one's ever seen a Verruca Gnome until tonight.
I've never heard of me until tonight, and I'm me.
We'll see what Hex can find out, Archchancellor.
Good man.
Amazing.
Now we should be able to get to the bottom of all this.
None of this is right.
Everyone knows he's just a jolly, old, fat man who hands out presents to kids.
- He wasn't always so jolly.
You know how it is.
- Do I?
That's like, you know, industrial retraining.
Even gods have to move with the times.
You see, your Hogfather was probably just your basic winter demi-urge.
You know, blood on the snow, making the sun come up.
So there has to be blood to make the sun come up?
Starts off with animal sacrifice, y'know, hunt some big hairy animal to death, that kind of stuff.
Very folkloric, very myffic.
Can't stop an animal, never.
They've had sacred paints, the strongest and the best.
Died on the dark time of the year to give life to the unconquered sun.
And, in a way, the Hogfather was all of it.
And then?
And then some bright spark thought, hey, looks like that damn sun comes up anyway, so how come we're giving those druids all this free grub?
The world moves on, and he's got to find a new job.
So it started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up.
Exactlimondo!
And now, he gives out presents.
Top of the evening, squire.
I am Corporal Nobbs of the Watch.
And this is Constable Visit, sir.
I want you to arrest him!
Arrest who, sir?
The Hogfather!
What for, sir?
He's sitting up there as bold as brass in his Grotto, giving away presents!
Not quite up to speed here, sir.
I thought the Hogfather is supposed to give away stuff, isn't he?
But this one is an impostor!
Y'know, I always thought that.
I thought, the Hogfather spends two weeks in a wooden grotto in some shop in Ankh-Morpork?
At his busy time, too?
Not likely.
He's not the Hogfather we usually have!
You mean, a different impostor?
Not the real impostor at all?
Yes!
...
No!
- Arrest the Hogfather, style of thing?
- Yes!
- On Hogswtach night?
- Yes!
For giving away present?
- In front of all these kiddies?
- Yes!
- In your shop?
- Ye... you think it might look a bit... bad?
Difficult to see how it could look good, sir.
Could you not do it surreptitiously?
Oh, well, yes.
Surreptition.
Yes, we could give that a try...
You won't find me ungrateful.
In Omnia, we call the Hogswatch night the Fast of St. Ossory.
But it is not an occasion for superstition and crass commercialism.
I used to hang up my stocking every Hogswatch, regular.
All that ever happened that my dad was sick in it once.
I'm going in.
There seems to be a thaumic surge from somewhere.
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
IT'S THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR LITTLE FACES I LIKE.
Yeah.
The sort of cross between fear and awe.
Not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants.
YES.
NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL BELIEF.
NEXT!
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME, LITTLE...
PERSON?
Nobby Nobbs, Hogfather.
AND HAVE YOU BEEN A GOOD BO...
A GOOD DWA...
A GOOD GNO...
A GOOD INDIVIDUAL?
'es.
So why isn't it working?
The chalk, just got a bit scuffed when we were piling up the.
Things.
You sure that's what it is?
What about the spell?
Oh, that'll go on for ever.
The simple ones do.
It's just a state change, powered by the... it just keeps going.
That's very good, Mr. Sideney.
Because if the sympathetic magic does not work, you'll find me very... unsympathetic.
What happened?
What happened?
This is disgusting, this whole business.
It is the worship of idols!
It's a genuine Burleigh and Stronginthearm doubleaction triple-cantilever crossbow with a polished walnut stock and silver engraved facings.
Aren't we going to arrest this impostor, corporal?
You're foreign, Washpot.
I can't expect you to know the real meaning of Hogswatch.
ON THE WHOLE, I THINK THAT WENT VERY WELL, DON'T YOU?
Yes, master.
AND I THINK I'VE GOT THE LAUGH WORKING REALLY WELL NOW.
HO!
HO!
HO!
Yes, sir, very jolly.
Tomorrow morning, they'll believe, all right.
THEY'D BETTER.
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T...
THEN THERE WON'T BE A TOMORROW MORNING.
So for the sun to come up tomorrow morning, the Hogfather has to be alive.
Precisemento.
What if he's dead?
And this was going to be your big moment.
It's him!
Such a shame!
Pretty lights...
Think happy, Banjo.
Wake up!
Wake up!
You got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
You're not the Hogfather!
There must be thousands here.
And what's all this stuff?
's just paper.
They're title deeds for properties.
And they're better than money.
If we steal them, do they become ours?
Is that a trick question?
Anyway, let's get going.
He won't miss a few-
Gentlemen.
We were just... piling up the stuff.
I know people say I'd kill them as soon as look at them.
And in fact I'd much rather kill you than look at you, Mr. Lilywhite.
You're thinking that Banjo is going to help you.
That's how it's always been, isn't it?
But Banjo is my friend now.
Banjo has the heart of a little child.
I believe I have, too.
Help them, Banjo.
As far as this goes, I really have no use for it.
It's only pillow money.
Something much more... interesting has become apparent.
Albert.
I don't see the Hogfather as someone who rolls his own.
Drop him.
Control!
Control the inner child, and he'll even give you his teeth.
And somewhere in this tower, you can help me find someone, who can use it.
Who can use it to... give me the world.
So what said, take the money and go?
Don't be so bloody stupid.
Daddy?
I say, it's not what you think!
Yes, it is.
Mr. Brown!
There's one door you haven't found.
Find the Tooth Fairy's secret room.
And when he does... then just think, what I can make the kiddies think.
Are you all right?
I wish I was dead.
I think you may have come to the right place.
- Oh, my head...
- Are you the Hogf...
I feel awful.
Have you got any ice?
DUTY CALLS.
Yeah, but which one?
That one or this one?
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
Yet to come, on Hogfather:
Happy Hogswatch!
Very well, I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
IF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE TOOTH FAIRY'S CASTLE IS NOT STOPPED,
THEN EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DOING IS A WASTE OF TIME.
AND IF THEY GET TO THE TOOTH FAIRY,
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ALL HUMAN BELIEF.
Mr. Brown, break me up the real Tooth Fairy.
UNLESS SUSAN GETS THERE FIRST.
I need your help, Mr. Ridcully.
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr. Teatime?
Something nasty is happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is, but he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you've brought him here?
He is the Oh God of Hangovers.
I wish you fellows would show some backbone!
- My grandfather is Death.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
This is fascinating.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr. Teacup.
I'm leaving, right?
With what's coming to me.
And you ain't stopping me.
What is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's Castle?
You're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Then let's see how creepy I can be.
Who the hell are you?
I'M THE HOGFATHER, OF COURSE.
ER...
HO, HO, HO.
YES, THIS WILL SHOW.
You are not allowed to do that.
THERE'S NO BETTER PRESENT THAN THE FUTURE.
Belief's causing new creatures to appear.
Is there a problem?
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU, THINKING ENGINE.
BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER!
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER!
YOU MUST BRING THE HOGFATHER HOME!
I'm going to have such fun with this.
So light.
You wouldn'd dare use it.
My grandfather will come after you.
He comes after everyone.
He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
It was the night before Hogswatch.
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up Tusker!
Up, Snouter!
Giddyup!
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly, fat man is about to deliver their presents,
not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
We offer you a commission.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
If you don't believe in the Hogfather, there won't be any presents.
Thought so.
Is Mr. Teatime still in the building?
It's pronounced Te-ah-tim-eh, sir.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with animals, sir.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
ALBERT.
SOMETHING HERE IS NOT RIGHT.
- Does he believe in things like the Tooth Fairy?
- Even the Hogfather.
'Cause after we're finished here, not even he will.
It's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
THE HOGFATHER.
OH, DEAR.
ALBERT?
WE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.
ONWARDS, BINKY, TO THE HOGFATHER'S CASTLE OF BONES.
- All of them?
- Every last one.
- Put 'em in a pile?
- That's millions.
APPLESAUCE.
OH, YES.
AND...
HO, HO, HO.
Grandfather?
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons, I will add, then that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
THE HOGFATHER IS UNAVAILABLE.
At Hogswatch?
HE IS GONE.
Susan will try to find out what this is all about.
YOU MIGHT THINK I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT,
BUT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clipping, hair, teeth...
You got them under your control.
Children of the world, prepare to take a short tour.
The Hogfather.
Grandfather, what've you done?
SO MANY CHIMNEYS.
I mean, if we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
No, I mean the Hogfather.
So, you got to look the part!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
IT'S THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR LITTLE FACES I LIKE.
Yeah.
The sort of cross between fear and awe.
Not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants.
YES.
NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL BELIEF.
Pretty lights...
You're not the Hogfather!
Daddy?
Wake up!
Wake up!
You got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
- It's not what you think!
- Yes, it is.
Are you the Hogf...
Everything starts somewhere, although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where, where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle the great A'tuin.
It was sometime after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories at the beginning are sooner or later
about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis:
things just happen, what the hell.
Our story began in Ankh-Morpork the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork the biggest city in Discworld.
A city, where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for wizards looms over all the dark, narrow streets below.
Our story continues in the middle of the night before Hogswatch, a mid-winter festivel, which, for some reason, bears a remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
But now it takes us to the Tooth Fairys castle, where magic's made children's teeth periliously powerful.
So that our story is, much sooner rather than later, about blood.
Mr. Teatime!
Very well, I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
I'm not telling you anything!
Who are you, anyway?
I'm glad you've asked!
I'm your worst nightmare!
You mean...the one with the giant cabbage and the kind of whirring knife thing?
Sorry, no.
Not that one.
I'm the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you stone dead.
Oh, that one.
But that's not very...
Rather a charitable act there, I feel.
But it is nearly Hogswatch, after all.
Bring me the girl.
ODD.
It's a scythe job, then?
They took the teeth!
All of them!
They just walked in, and... no, wait!
Where did he come from?
A PLACE I CANNOT GO.
Well, you'd better pull down.
We've got Alber come out here, keeping the Hogfather's seat warm.
IF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE TOOTH FAIRY'S CASTLE ISN'T STOPPED,
THEN EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DOING IS A WASTE OF TIME.
AND IF THEY GET TO THE TOOTH FAIRY,
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ALL HUMAN BELIEF.
UNLESS SUSAN GETS THERE FIRST.
Yes, well, it's coming along well.
Very impressive!
Well done.
I need your help, Mr. Ridcully.
I, err... you're...
Yes.
The scythe, the cloak, the white horse, the granddaughter.
I need you to wake him up.
His name's Bilious.
He's the oh God of Hangovers.
Something nasty's happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is.
But he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you brought him here?
Why are you doing that?
- I mean, I was a bit behind with the teeth, I know...
- Is this her door?
- Don't know, there was 13 dollars in pillow money...
- Is this her door?
I admit, but I signed the form GV19 for them...
Will you just shut up and answer the question?
I don't know, I've never been here before.
Your boss probably doesn't realise how irritating you are.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Or Miss Bottler gets is.
S'that good, I g'it!
Have you got the lid?
THIS IS REALLY, REALLY STUPID.
I think the tradition got started when everyone had them big chimneys, master.
INDEED?
IT'S ONLY A MERCY IT'S UNLIT.
THE BOY WANTS A PAIR OF TROUSERS THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE,
A HUGE MEAT PIE, A SUGAR MOUSE, 'A LOT OF TOYS' AND A PUPPY CALLED SCRUFF.
Ah, sweet.
I shall wipe away a tear, 'cos what he's gettin', see, is this little wooden toy and an apple.
BUT THE LETTER CLEARLY...
I know, it's the socio-economic factors.
The world'd be in a hell of a mess if everyone got what they asked for, eh?
I GAVE THEM WHAT THEY WANTED IN THE STORE.
What good's a god who gives you everything you want?
YOU HAVE ME THERE.
It's the hope that's important.
It's a big part of belief, hope.
Give people jam today and they'll just sit and eat it.
Jam tomorrow, now - that'll keep them going for ever.
AND YOU MEAN THAT BECAUSE OF THIS THE POOR GET POOR THINGS
AND THE RICH GET RICH THINGS?
Oh, yeah.
That's the meaning of Hogswatch, isn't it, master?
BUT I'M THE HOGFATHER!
AT THE MOMENT, I MEAN.
Makes no difference.
I remember when I was a nipper, it was one Hogswatch.
I had my heart set on this huge model horse in this shop.
It was what I always wanted.
Someone was in there buying it.
And you know, just for a second,
I thought it really was going to be for me.
But it wasn't.
I spent hours with my nose pressed up against the window, until someone heard me callin', and unfroze me.
I'd've killed for that horse.
But I still hung up my stocking on Hogswatch Eve.
You know why?
Because I had hope!
And the next morning, our dad's put in my stocking a little wooden horse, that he carved his very own self.
AH, AND THAT WAS WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE EXPENSIVE TOY HORSES IN THE WORLD!
No, 'cause you're a selfish little bugger when you're seven.
Only grown-ups think like that.
THIS IS WRONG.
IT IS...
UNFAIR.
That's life, is it, master, isn't it?
BUT I'M NOT.
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY.
AND OTHER THINGS ENDING IN OLLY.
Please, just take her out of vocal range.
Mr. Brown!
Your big moment.
Break me up the real Tooth Fairy.
If you're the Lecturer in Recent Runes, can't you do something more magical?
Well, Spold's Unstirring Divisor would do it.
You'd end up with a large beaker full of all the nastiness.
Not difficult at all, if you don't mind the side effects.
Tell me about the side effects.
The main one is that the rest of him would end up in a somewhat larger beaker.
Alive?
Broadly, yes.
Living tissue, certainly.
And definitely sober.
Why don't we just mix up absolutely everything and see what happens?
It's got to be worth a try.
Thank you, Modo.
Is this going to take much longer?
We may not have much time.
Oh, you can't be too careful.
What's that?
Wow-Wow Sauce.
The hottest sauce in the Universe.
And it will blow your head clean off.
It's not safe to drink it when sweat's still condensing on the bottle.
On the other hand, it's a kill-or-cure remedy then we are, given the possibility that the patient is immortal, probably on to a winner.
It did not go critical yet.
I don't know, I wish you fellows would show some backbone...
Careful, Archchancellor.
What you have there might represent pure sobriety!
I'll try it.
You did say that he was immortal, didn't you?
- You mean... he just appeared?
- Yes.
He has no memory of existing before appearing at the Hogfather's castle.
You mean like this fella?
Don't be ridiculous, gods and gnomes don't just appear for no reason!
Bring me, let's see, twenty pints of lager, some pepper vodka, and a bottle of cofee liquor.
I didn't have you sobered up just so that you can go on a binge.
- You don't drink!
- I don't?
Oh.
Yeah.
I need you to help me!
I'm afraid did it, didn't I?
I said something to young Stibbons about drinking and hangovers.
You mean you created him just like that?
I find that very hard to believe.
Good job nobody mentioned the Hair Loss Fairy, then.
I am not losing my hair!
It is just very finely spaced.
Yes, half on your head and half on your hairbrush!
For the last time, I am not...
I wish I knew where that was coming from.
We need a bigger brain for this.
That thinking engine of yours is working, Ponder?
Hex is resting, Archchancellor.
Can you hear me in there?
You don't have to shout, Archchancellor.
What is that glingleglingleglingle noise all about?
It says, look on the Dean.
Over the Dean?
Is there a problem?
Are you the Hair Loss Fairy?
Apparently.
What have you been doing with my hair?
Just a minute!
Where exactly were you, before I found you in the snow?
Anywhere where drink was consumed in beastly quantities some time previously, you could say.
So, you were an immanent vital force, eh?
Oh, sounds great!
What is that?
So when we joked about the Hair Loss Fairy it suddenly focused on the Dean's head.
You're calling things into being.
I personally always wondered, if there was an Eater of Socks.
You know how there's always one missing.
To the laundry!
Tell me again, who these people are.
Some of the cleverest men in the world.
And I'm sober, am I?
What is that ridiculous thing on your head?
I dunno, sir!
What?
What is it?
It says here, 'If found, please return to the Tooth Fairy's castle.'
At least the Tooth Fairy already existed.
Tooth Fairy...
Oh, you see her around a lot these days.
Or them, rather.
It's a sort of franchise operation to collect children's teeth in exchange for money.
And she has a castle?
She sounds great.
Actually, I do remember one thing.
When I appeared at the Hogfather's house, there was this drunken little fellow in a pointy hat.
I thought it was just the drink talking, but he did mention something about...
Permanent end of the patrol-servitude for the little elves!
Of all fantasy personifications.
...including the Tooth Fairy.
Where did you find this?
Is he all right?
I say, what is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's castle?
Now I'm feeling all well.
Can I come with you?
This is not a normal situation.
Look, I think I better tell you.
- My grandfather is Death.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Death.
You know, Death?
The robes, the scythe, the white horse, bones.
Death.
But at the moment he's acting rather strange.
I just want to make sure I got this clear.
You think your grandfather is Death, and you think he's acting strange.
Look, Death adopted my mother.
He then took on a human apprentice.
They fell in love, and I'm the result.
This is fascinating.
Let's just say I've picked up a few, strange genetic signs on the way.
Oh, that looks dangerous.
I hope so.
Wait, I could help you!
Would you be any good in a fight?
Yes, I could be sick on people!
I have to sort this out.
Can't have creatures popping into existence just by people talking about them.
Unhygienic.
So what is this implied creation, eh?
Humans have always ascribed random, seasonal, natural or inexplicable actions to human shaped entities.
Such examples are the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy and Death.
All right, but I'm damn sure there's never been an Eater of Socks or an oh God of Hangovers.
I think it works like this:
What we're getting is personification of forces, just like Hex said.
Like the Hogfather?
When you're a kiddie, it's as good an explanation, as any to where the presents come from.
Why is it happening now?
Belief's causing new creatures to appear?
You could put it like that.
There's a finite quantitiy of belief in the Universe?
Certainly, people're going to believe only in so many things.
It follows that if a major focus of belief is removed, there would be spare belief.
What are people not believing in all of a sudden?
Out of cheese error?
Melon, melon, melon.
Redo from start!
It's Hogswatch.
I suppose the Hogfather is around, isn't he?
I LIKE THIS JOB.
Oh dear, oh dear.
EXCUSE ME.
YES.
THIS WILL SHOW.
The poor little match girls dying in the snow is all part of the spirit of Hogswatch, master.
You see, people hear about it, and they say:
'we might be as poor as a disabled banana, and only can afford to eat mud and boots, but see how much better off we are than the poor little match girl?
'
It makes them feel happy and grateful for what they've got.
I KNOW WHAT THE SPIRIT OF HOGSWATCH IS, ALBERT.
You're not allowed to do that!
THE HOGFATHER CAN.
THE HOGFATHER GIVES PRESENTS.
THERE IS NO BETTER PRESENT THAN THE FUTURE.
That's it.
I had enough with this pixie life.
I'm waiting for the Hogfather.
I'm in the dark, waiting for the Hogfather.
Me.
A believer in natural philosophy.
I can find the square root of 27.4 in my head.
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's not as if I've hung a stocking up.
There'd be some point if...
TAKE HER SOMEWHERE WARM, AND GIVE HER A GOOD DINNER.
AND I MAY WELL BE CHECKING ON LATER.
Looks like we've been chosen to do a bit of charity.
Well, I don't call it very charitable just dumping someone on people, like this.
I dunno.
Some people wouldn't know the real meaning of Hogswatch if it jumps up and caught them in the grope.
No!
This is a child's painting.
Twyla paints like that.
I painted like that.
Grandfather saved some of my draw-
Come on, let's find the house.
What house?
There's always a house.
I was told you're the best locksmith in the city.
Yes, but locks normally don't alter themselves while you're working on them, that's what I'm saying.
Are you the best, or not?
No!
Not the dark!
Banjo!
I'm getting out of here.
Something's wrong with this place.
I've made a big pile!
You want to come with me?
Pretty here.
Mr. Sideney.
Would he deliver to apes earlier than to humans?
Interesting point, sir.
Possibly, you are referring to my theory that humans may have descended from apes.
A bold hypothesis, which, if the grants committee could just see their way clear to letting me hire a boat, and sail around... to the islands...
I just thought, he might deliver alphabetically.
LET ME SEE NOW...
Who the hell are you?
I'M THE HOGFATHER, OF COURSE.
ER...
HO, HO, HO.
You look extremely thin in the face.
I'M...
I'M A BIT ILL.
Terminately, I would say.
It's a false beard!
NO, IT'S NOT!
It's got hooks for the ears!
That must have given you a spot of trouble.
A pillow!
I thought there were seven locks.
Yes, but they're half magic and half real and half not there.
There's parts of them that don't exist all the time!
I thought you could open any lock anyone ever made.
Made by humans, And most dwarfs.
I dunno what made these.
You never said anything about magic.
That's a shame.
Then really I have no more need of your services.
You may as well go back home.
What about my money?
Of course, you should get what you deserve.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr. Teacup.
I'm leaving, right?
With what's coming to me.
And you ain't stopping me.
Banjo certainly ain't.
I knew his old Ma in the good old days.
You think you're nasty?
You think you're mean?
Ma Lilywhite'd tear your ears off and spit 'em in your eye, you cocky little devil.
I remembers you when you was little, Banjo.
I used to sit you on my knees!
Banjo!
There you are.
Where do all those shadows coming from?
It's giving me the creeps!
And it's all your fault!
Oh, yeah?
So it wasn't you who said, wow, ten thousand dollars, count me in?
Yeah, but I didn't know there was going to be all this creepy stuff!
I want to go home!
You're acting like a child!
Poor guy must've slipped.
Yeah.
He slipped.
That's the Tooth Fairy's castle?
It's teeth.
And I should be scared?
There's nothing that scary about teeth.
Did I say I was scared?
I must just be hung over, again.
- Oh, no.
- They're only teeth?
Surely, noone would try to...
What is that?
It's such old magic, it isn't even magic anymore.
If you've got a piece of someone's hair, nail clippings or tooth, you can control them.
Don't tell me someone is...
- What's that shadow?
- This place is alive.
And it's protecting itself.
Now, what happened to the other fellow?
WELL, THE HOGFATHER HAS ENEMIES.
What'd he do?
Miss a chimney?
There's people down there, Mr. Teatime!
Well, just do away with them.
One of them is a girl.
Then do away with them... politely.
Keep going.
Quicker.
Aaah!
It's after me!
Let me out!
What was that?
It's finding their nightmares.
Let me out!
It's after me!
Pull yourself together.
There's nothing chasing you.
I thought it was the... wardrobe.
What wardrobe?
When I was a kid, we had this big... wardrobe.
And it had this... on the door... it had this face!
And it made me... whispered things.
Who's that moving up there?
I think they saw us.
If they are tooth fairies, there has been a really stupid equal opportunity policy.
Right.
You go that way, I this way.
- Why don't we stay together?
- What's got into you?
This is a children's place.
The rules are what children believe.
Well, that's a relief.
You think so?
It's impossible to die here.
My grandfather doesn't figure in the child's world.
That man who fell down the stairs looked pretty dead to me.
Oh, you die.
But not here.
You...
let's see... yes.
You go somewhere else.
Away.
- Aren't you Sus...
- Yes.
When you came for Twyla's last tooth, you were so shocked I could see you.
Look, we may not have a lot of time.
Is this the Tooth Fairy?
A tooth fairy.
Do you drink at all?
No, I don't.
Not touch alcohol, at all?
Never.
My dad's very strict about that sort of thing.
Nice castle!
Can we get on?
Good.
Who brought you here, Violet?
I don't know.
Oh, but he's dressed like an assassin!
OK.
You two stay here, I'll go, find him.
And I'll look after Violet.
That's the fourth lock, open.
I commend your expertise.
And the others?
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr. Teatime?
Logically, she's the guardian of children's beliefs.
And this is her castle.
And I come across as securely locked door as this, and not to thoroughly investigate woud... lack elegance.
What's that sound?
What sound?
That sound!
Like all... scissors, grating.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE AUDITORS?
I suppose the Bursar might have done.
NOT AUDITORS OF MONEY.
AUDITORS OF REALITY.
THEY'RE THE CIVIL SERVICE OF EVERYTHING.
And they want to get rid of us.
THEY WANT HUMANS TO BE LESS CREATIVE.
THE HOGFATHER IS A SYMBOL OF THIS.
STRANGE THINKING.
THEY HATE THE WAY HUMANS MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT THE UNIVERSE.
I can't think why.
Anyway, why are you doing this job?
SOMEONE MUST.
IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT.
BEFORE DAWN, THERE MUST BE ENOUGH BELIEF IN THE HOGFATHER.
Why?
SO THAT THE SUN WILL COME UP.
I SELDOM JOKE.
What sort of goding do you do?
Well, I'm the oh God of Hangovers.
A God of Hangovers?
How awful.
You're more cut out to be one of those improtant gods.
What's this?
Lovers' Lane?
You leave him alone, you!
He's a god!
Dear me, out of thunderbolts, are we?
Well, y'know, I've never killed a...
What's the matter?
It is a wardrobe, yes.
I don't want to see!
I don't want to see!
Hex was right, Archchancellor.
HEX?
WHO IS HEX?
He's the biggest thinker in the world.
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THIS MR. HEX.
Quite a large thaumic reading, gentlemen.
I think he got here by magic.
THEY SAY YOU ARE THE BIGGEST THINKER IN THE WORLD.
BUT DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE?
+++ Yes +++
EXTEND LOGICALLY THE RESULT OF THE HUMAN RACE CEASING TO BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER.
WILL THE SUN COME UP?
ANSWER.
+++The Sun Will Not Come Up+++
CORRECT.
HOW MAY THIS BE PREVENTED?
ANSWER.
+++Regular and Consistent Belief+++
GOOD.
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU, THINKING ENGINE.
BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER.
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER.
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER!
+++YES+++
GOOD.
...OH, NO... +++Dear Hogfather, for Hogswatch I want...
LET ME SEE.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
AND HAVE YOU BEEN NAUGHTY, OR NICE?
Hello.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
Bone handle, rather tasteless skull and bone decoration...
Death himself's second favourite weapon.
Am I right?
Oh, my.
It must be Hogswatch.
This must mean that you are Susan.
The famous granddaughter.
Nobility.
I'd bow, but I'm afraid you would do something... dreadful.
Yes!
Yes!
Left-handed using a wooden pick!
That's simple.
Ah, Mr. Teatime!
I've managed to open the fifth lock.
Not a problem!
It's just based on Woddeley's Occul Sequence.
How do you know who I am?
Easy.
Twurp's Peerage.
Family motto: 'Non temetis messor'.
Your father was well known.
Went a long way very fast.
As for your grandfather... honestly, that motto. 'Fear Not The Reaper'.
Is that good taste?
Of course, you don't need to fear him, do you?
Or do you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who are you, anyway?
I beg your pardon.
My name is Teatime, Jonathan Teatime.
At your service.
You mean...
like around four o'clock in the afternoon?
No.
I did say Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Please don't try to break my concentration by annoying me.
How are you getting on, Mr. Sideney?
If it's just according to Woddeley's sequence, number six should be copper and blue-green light.
Do you think your grandfather will try to rescue you?
But now I have his sword, you see.
I wonder...
All fingers and thumbs, Mr. Sideney?
I've managed to open the sixth lock, Mr. Teatime.
Really?
But it may not be all important now.
Thank you, anyway.
You've been most helpful.
Yes, you may go.
Is that all you're here for?
A robbery?
Like a petty thief.
A thief?
Me?
I'm not a thief, madam.
No, these gentlemen are thieves.
That's Medium Dave and exhibit B is Banjo.
He can talk!
- Who are you?
- I'm incognito!
Look like a wizard to me.
Did you suck your thumb when you were litle?
No!
That's the Scissor Man!
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Kids believe all kinds of crap!
But I'm grown up now, right.
No more Hogfather.
And that's only the start.
I'll be able to make people believe anything I want.
What's this?
You said no more Hogfather?
He does know what we've been doing here, doesn't he?
You did tell him?
There's gotta be a Hogfather.
There's always a Hogfather.
She did it!
She killed him!
No, I didn't!
- Did!
- Didn't!
- Did!
- Didn't!
Did!
What's this about the Hogfather?
I don't think he's dead, but Teatime has made him very ill.
Who cares?
When this is over, Banjo, you'll have as many presents as you want.
Trust me.
There has to be a Hogfather, or there's no Hogswatch!
It's just another solar festival!
Banjo and me are going.
Bajo!
You're coming with me, right now.
Grab her, Banjo.
It's all her fault.
Our Mom said, no hitting girls!
No touching 'em, or pulling' their hair!
She's not a girl.
She's a freak!
I think I know you, Teatime.
You're the mad kid they're all scared of, right?
Banjo!
I said, grab her.
Our Mom said...
The kid who didn't know the difference between chucking a stone at a cat, and setting it on fire.
Shut up!
Get her, Banjo!
The kind of little boy, who looks up dolls' dresses.
I didn't.
- Our Mom said...
- Oh, to blazes with your mam!
What'd you say about our mam?
I bet no one wanted to played with you, not the kid with no friends.
Banjo!
You do as I tell you.
Our... our mam... our mam said...
Have you been a bad boy, Banjo?
You've been letting him get into trouble again, eh, Davey?
You have, ain't you?
No, Mom!
No, Mom!
You need a good hiding, Banjo?
Sorry, sorry, Mom!
You been playing with girls again?
Sorry, sorry, Mom!
No Mum no Mum no Mum nooooh Mum!
Oh, no!
I don't think so!
This place gets into your head, doesn't it?
It finds out how to deal with you.
But I'm in touch with my inner child.
It's so much fun.
No pulling' girls hair!
That's bad!
I'm going to have such fun with it!
It's so light.
You wouldn't dare use it.
My grandfather will come after you!
He comes after everyone.
He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
It doesn't work here.
There's no death here.
Hi, inner child!
I'm the inner baby sitter!
Happy Hogswatch!
Is he dead?
He's not breathing.
Breathing spell... breathing spell!
Spolt's Forthright Respirator, perhaps.
I think I've got it written down somewhere...
Come on, chaps!
Give me some space.
Excuse me, excuse me!
This is vitally important for the advancement of natural philosophy.
Did you see any bright lights?
Was there a shining tunnel?
Did any deceased...
What's all this, Mr Stibbons?
Put the damn quill away!
This must be the Unseen University.
And you're all wizards.
There was a sword!
Oh, yes.
It's fallen on the floor.
Did I do that?
I really must be off.
He won't get far.
The main doors are locked in accordance with Archchancellor Spode's Rules.
Won't get far... while holding a sword that appears to be able to cut through anything.
You can get into trouble, hitting girls.
No playin' with girls.
What can we do now?
Hello, my dear.
No.
Sorry, dear?
You're not the Tooth Fairy.
Oh, I am, dear.
Grandma, what big teeth you have.
You've even got a shawl.
Oh, dear.
I don't understand, lovely.
You forgot the rocking chair.
I always thought there'd be a rocking chair.
I don't think you're real.
It's not a little, old woman in a shawl, running this place.
You're out of my head.
That's how you defend yourself.
You poke around in people's head, and find the things...
No.
It's horrible, but it does not frighten me.
I like spiders.
Dogs, no.
I like rats, rats are fine.
Sorry, is anyone frightened of that?
Help!
I...
I...
You're a bogeyman, aren't you?
Not 'a'.
The!
The first Bogeyman!
You look terrible.
Thank you very much.
I mean ill.
I used to jump out on them, and say:
Boo!
But then, I got to like them.
Only children were frigthened of me.
I mean, what's to be scared of?
Bones, phoney arms...
But then, I discovered that there are much worse things than me.
And I wanted to protect the children.
Get them safe from all the really bad things.
So, I built all this, to be a safe place.
And the teeth?
You don't leave all those teeth around, anything could happen!
Anything nearly did.
So, you are the Tooth Fairy, then.
Yes.
I... and then they came... stealing.
I'm too weak to look after them any more.
You don't die here.
Just get old.
Listening to the laughter...
Don't worry about the teeth.
I'll make them safe again.
I think it would be a good idea, if you did the Tooth Fairy's job, Banjo.
D'ya think that be all right?
Won't the Tooth Fairy mind?
You... do it until she comes back.
Who's gonna tell me what to do?
Noone's ever going to tell you what to do again, Banjo.
Thanks, Miss.
I'll keep the teeth safe.
- Ah, Miss?
- Yes, Banjo?
Can I have a puppy?
I had a kitten, but our Mom's drowned it 'cause it was dirty.
I think it will turn up quite soon, Banjo.
Thanks, Miss.
With Violet we talked about it and we thought we ought to come back and help.
It's okay.
They're all gone.
And Banjo needed a new job.
That's funny.
So does Bili!
Why don't you two make yourself useful, and help Banjo clear up this mess.
He's pretty much running the place now.
- But he's a...
- He's in charge.
We'd love to help Banjo.
Together.
Good.
Have fun.
Now I'm going home.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
Grandfather, what're you doing here?
IT IS NOT OVER.
YOU MUST BRING THE HOGFATHER HOME.
These look like the mountains where the Castle of Bones was.
THEY ARE.
- It's a pig!
- A BOAR.
This boar is the...
YES.
THE HOGFATHER, AS HE BEGAN.
And the dogs...
THESE ARE NOT REAL DOGS.
IF THEY CATCH HIM, HE WON'T JUST DIE.
HE WILL NEVER BE.
Well, stop them!
THIS IS A HUMAN THING.
THE AUDITORS ARE DESPERATE NOW.
THEY ARE DETERMINED TO DESTROY THE HOGFATHER,
AT WHATEVER COST.
YOU MUST SAVE HIM.
Come on, jump!
Just you try it!
Yes!
Who wants some?
Anyone else?
HO, HO, HO.
YOU COULDN'T RESIST IT IN THE END.
A MISTAKE, I FANCY.
IT GETS UNDER YOUR SKIN, LIFE.
SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE.
AND, YOU SEE, THE MORE YOU STRUGGLE FOR EVERY MOMENT,
THE MORE ALIVE YOU STAY.
WHICH IS WHERE I COME IN, AS A MATTER OF FACT.
You can't do this!
There are rules!
YES.
THERE ARE RULES.
BUT YOU BROKE THEM!
HOW DARE YOU?
HOW DARE YOU?
AND NOW, THERE REMAINS ONLY ONE, FINAL QUESTION...
HAVE YOU BEEN NAUGHTY, OR NICE?
HO.
HO.
HO.
We saved you.
Dying isn't how it's supposed to go.
OH.
SORRY.
Well.
That about wraps it up for this dress.
I'd just like to ask, purely out of academic interest, you were sure I was going to survive, were you?
I WAS QUITE CONFIDENT.
Good.
Now, tell me...
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU HADN'T SAVED HIM?
Yes.
THE SUN WOULD NOT HAVE RISEN.
Then what would have happened?
A MERE BALL OF FLAMING GAS WOULD HAVE ILLUMINATED THE WORLD.
All right, I'm not stupid.
You're sayint that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.
NO.
HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN.
TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.
With Tooth Fairies?
Hogfathers?
YES.
THAT'S PRACTICE.
YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE LITTLE LIES.
So we can believe the big ones?
YES.
JUSTICE, MERCY, DUTY, THAT SORT OF THING.
They're not the same at all.
YOU THINK SO?
THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER,
AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE,
AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE,
ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY.
AND YET...
YOU TRY TO ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD.
AS IF THERE IS SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE,
BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.
But people have got to believe that.
What's the point?
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE.
HOW ELSE CAN THEY BECOME?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VISIT FOR HOGSWATCH DINNER?
ALBERT IS FRYING A PUDDING.
I... er... they're really expecting me here.
Would you like a drink before you go?
A CUP OF COCOA WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
Right.
There are biscuits in the tin on the mantlepiece.
Susan's got a poker, you know.
MY GOODNESS ME.
I thought all of you knew that by now.
INDEED.
Last week she picked a bogey up by its nose.
I'll give Gawain his stocking and then I'll come and watch.
SUSAN?
Well, well, now this is unexpected.
A family affair?
I wonder, is it possible to kill Death?
This must be a very special sword.
And it certainly works here.
And of course, it might well not be regarded as murder.
Possibly it is a civic act.
It would be, as they say... the Big One.
You may have some personal knowledge about your vulnerability, but I'm pretty certain that Susan here would quite definitely die.
So I'd rather you didn't try any last-minute stuff.
I AM LAST MINUTE STUFF.
I don't remember them asking for anything that made a noise.
OH, THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE STOCKING THAT MAKES A NOISE.
OTHERWISE WHAT IS 4.30 A.M. FOR?
There are children?
Oh yes, of course.
Call them!
Certainly not.
It will be instructive.
Educational.
And when your adversary is Death, you cannot help but be the good guy.
Call them.
Gawain, Twyla!
Come in, come in, curly-haired tots!
I've caught this bogeyman.
What shall we do with him, eh?
It's only a skeleton.
Yes, a nasty, creepy, horrible skeleton.
Scary, ah?
He's eating a biscuit.
A creepy bony man in a black robe.
You're fidgeting with that kettle.
So I expect you're thinking of doing something creative.
Put it down, please.
Slowly.
Huh, that's not very creepy, it's just bones.
It's just standing there.
It's not even making woo-woo noises.
And anyway you're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Really?
Then let's see how creepy I can be.
Oh, no.
It could not have gone through you.
So many ribs, and things...
It only kills monsters.
Stop time, now!
You winked at me.
I thought you had a plan!
INDEED, OH YES.
I PLANNED TO SEE WHAT YOU'D DO.
What?
I DID ADD THE SPARKLY STARS AND THE NOISE, THOUGH.
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
And if I hadn't done anything?
I DARESAY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.
AT THE LAST MINUTE.
That was the last minute.
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME FOR ANOTHER LAST MINUTE.
STOP PLAYING DEAD, MISTER TEH-AH-TIM-EH.
You got it right!
OF COURSE.
I'LL TAKE THE BODY.
THAT WILL PREVENT INCONVENIENT QUESTIONS.
YOU DID KNOW THE POKER WOULD GO THROUGH ME?
I was quite confident.
I'VE MADE THIS FOR YOU.
Thank you.
Er... what is it?
ALBERT SAID THERE OUGHT TO BE SNOW ON IT,
BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE MELTED.
IT IS, OF COURSE, A HOGSWATCH CARD.
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A ROBIN ON IT AS WELL,
BUT I HAD CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING IT TO STAY ON.
IT WAS NOT AT ALL CO-OPERATIVE.
Really?
IT DID NOT SEEM TO GET INTO THE HOGSWATCH SPIRIT AT ALL.
Thank you.
Granddad?
YES?
Why?
I mean, why did you do all this?
HUMAN BEINGS MAKE LIFE SO INTERESTING.
DO YOU KNOW THAT IN A UNIVERSE SO FULL OF WONDERS,
THEY'VE MANAGED TO INVENT BOREDOM?
QUITE ASTONISHING.
NOW THEN...
HAPPY HOGSWATCH!
Yes.
Granddad!
Happy Hogswatch.
HAPPY HOGSWATCH, AND GOOD NIGHT, CHILDREN EVERYWHERE!
Hello, hello!
..
YOU HAVE A BIG, WOODEN ROCKING HORSE IN THE WINDOW.
Yes, yes.
That's a special order for Lord Lotten...
HOW MUCH WOULD HIS LORDSHIP HAVE PAID YOU?
Twelve dollars.
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTY.
Would you like me to wrap it up for you, sir?
NO.
I'LL TAKE IT AS IT IS, THANK YOU.
INCIDENTALLY, THERE'S A SMALL BOY OUT THERE,
WITH HIS NOSE FROZEN TO THE WINDOW.
SOME WARM WATER SHOULD DO THE TRICK.
Happy Hogswatch, sir!
I think it would be a good idea if you did the Tooth Fairy's job, Banjo.
Do...
Do you think that'd be alright?
Won't the Tooth Fairy mind?
You... do it until she comes back.
So.... who's gonna tell me what to do?
No one's ever going to tell you what to do again, Banjo.
Thanks, miss.
I'll keep the teeth safe.
- Er, miss?
- Yes, Banjo?
Can I have a puppy?
I had a kitten, but our mam drownded it cos it was dirty.
I think it'll turn up quite soon, Banjo.
Thanks, miss.
Billy!
Violet's talked about it and we thought we ought to come back and help.
- It's OK.
They're all gone.
- Oh.
And Banjo needed a new job.
That's funny.
So does Billy.
Look, why don't you two make yourselves useful and help Banjo clear up this mess?
He's pretty much running the place now.
- Oh, but he's...
- He's in charge.
We'd love to help, Banjo.
Together.
Good.
Have fun.
Now I'm going home.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
Grandfather!
What are you doing here?
It is not over.
You must bring the Hogfather home.
These look like the mountains where the Castle of Bones was.
They are.
- It's a pig!
- A boar.
This boar is the?
Yes.
The Hogfather as he began.
- And the dogs.
- These are not real dogs.
If they catch him, he won't just die.
He will... never be.
Well, stop them.
This is a human thing.
The Auditors are desperate now.
They're determined to destroy the Hogfather at whatever cost.
You must save him.
Come on.
Jump.
Just you try it.
Yes!
Who wants some?
Anyone else?
Ho, ho, ho.
You couldn't resist it in the end.
A mistake, I fancy.
It gets under your skin, life.
Speaking metaphorically, of course.
And, you see, the more you struggle for every moment, the more alive you stay.
Which is where I come in, as a matter of fact.
You can't do this.
There are rules.
Yes, there are rules.
But you broke them.
How dare you.
How dare you!
And now there remains only one final question.
Have you been naughty or nice?
Ho, ho, ho.
We saved you.
Dying's not how it's supposed to go!
Er...
Er, sorry.
Hyah!
Well that about wraps it up for this dress.
I'd just like to ask, purely out of academic interest, you were sure I was going to survive, were you?
I was quite confident.
Good.
Now, tell me...
What would've happened if you hadn't saved him?
- Yes.
- The sun would not have risen.
Then what would've happened?
A mere ball of flaming gas would have illuminated the world.
Alright, I'm not stupid.
You're saying that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.
No.
Humans need fantasy to be human.
To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.
With tooth fairies, Hogfathers...
Yes.
As practice, you have to start out learning to believe the little lies.
- So we can believe the big ones?
- Yes.
Justice, mercy, duty, that sort of thing.
- They're not the same at all.
- You think so?
Then, take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve, and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy.
And yet, you try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world, as if there is some... some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.
But people have got to believe that, or what's the point?
You need to believe in things that aren't true.
How else can they become?
Er, would you like to visit for Hogswatch dinner?
Albert is frying a pudding.
I, er...
Well, they're really expecting me here.
Would you like a drink before you go?
A cup of cocoa would be appropriate in the circumstances.
Right.
There are biscuits in the tin on the mantelpiece.
- Susan's got a poker, you know.
- My goodness me.
I thought all of you knew that by now.
Indeed.
Last week, she picked a bogey up by its nose.
I'll give Gawain his stocking, then I'll come and watch.
Susan...
Well, well.
Now, this is... unexpected.
A family affair.
I wonder...
Is it possible to kill... death?
Hmm!
This must be a very special sword.
And it certainly works here.
And, of course, it might well not be regarded as murder.
Possibly it is... a civic act.
It would be, as they say the big one.
You may have some personal knowledge about your vulnerability, but I'm pretty certain that Susan here will quite definitely die.
So I'd rather you didn't try any last-minute stuff.
I am last-minute stuff.
I don't remember them asking for anything that made a noise.
Oh, there has to be something in the stocking that makes a noise.
Otherwise, what is 4:30am for?
There are children?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
- Call them.
- Certainly not.
It'll be instructive.
Educational.
And when your adversary is Death, you can't help but be the good guy.
Call them.
Gawain.
Twyla.
Come in.
Come in!
Curly haired tots!
I caught this bogeyman.
What shall we do with him, huh?
It's only a skeleton!
Yes.
A nasty, creepy, horrible skeleton.
Scary, huh?
He's eating a biscuit.
A creepy, bony man in a black robe.
You're fidgeting with that kettle, so I expect you're thinking of doing something creative.
Put it down.
Please.
- Slowly.
- Huh!
That's not very creepy.
It's just bones.
It's just standing there.
It's not even making "whoo-whoo" noises.
And, anyway, you're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Really?
Well, let's see how creepy I can be.
Oh, no!
Couldn't have gone through you.
There's so many ribs... and things.
It only kills monsters.
Stop time now.
You winked at me.
I thought you had a plan.
Indeed.
Oh, yes.
- I planned to see what you would do.
- What?
I did add the sparkly stars and the noise, though.
I thought they would be appropriate.
And if I hadn't done anything?
I dare say I would have thought of something
- at the last minute.
- That was the last minute.
There is always time for another last minute.
Stop playing dead, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.
You got it right.
Of course.
I'll take care of the body.
That will prevent inconvenient questions.
Erm, you did know the poker would go through me?
I was quite confident.
Ah.
I have made this for you.
Oh!
Thank you.
What is it?
Albert said there ought to be snow on it, but it appears to have melted.
It is, of course, a Hogswatch card.
Oh.
There should have been a robin on it as well, but I had considerable difficulty in getting it to stay on.
Ah.
- It was not at all cooperative.
- Really?
It did not seem to get into the Hogswatch spirit at all.
Oh.
Thank you.
- Granddad?
- Yes?
Why?
I mean, why did you do all this?
Human beings make life so interesting.
Do you know that in a universe so full of wonders, they have managed to invent boredom?
- Quite astonishing.
- Oh.
Well, then, er...
Happy Hogswatch.
Yes.
Granddad.
Happy Hogswatch.
A Happy Hogswatch and good night, children, everywhere.
Ooh!
Hello!
Hello!
Oh, you're cute.
Yeah, come on.
Come on, let's play.
Yeah.
You have a big, wooden rocking horse in the window.
Er... yes.
That's a special order I made for...
Lord Rodney.
How much would this lordship have paid you?
- $12.
- I will give you 50.
Would you like me to wrap it, sir?
No.
I will take it as it is.
Thank you.
Incidentally, there is a small boy out there with his nose frozen to the window.
Some warm water should do the trick.
Happy Hogswatch, sir.
Everything starts somewhere although many physicists disagree.
There is the the constant desire to find out where.
Where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that, the Discworld was formed drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle, the great A'Tuin.
It was some time after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories of the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis.
"Things just happen.
What the hell?"
And so our story begins in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld, a city where magic is just another job, and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for Wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets.
Our story begins on a midwinter festival bearing a remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
And so.... it was the night before Hogswatch.
"And then Jack chopped down what was the world's last beanstalk, adding murder and ecological terrorism to the theft, enticement and trespass charges already mentioned, and all the giant's children didn't have a daddy any more."
"But he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done.
which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you are a hero, because no one asks inconvenient questions."
And now, it's time for bed.
- Susan?
- Yes?
You know last week when we wrote letters to the Hogfather?
- Yes?
- Well, will he really come?
And when's he coming here?
Does it matter, if you get the presents anyway?
Yes.
Well, if you don't believe in the Hogfather,
- there won't be any presents.
- Thought so.
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly fat man is about to deliver their presents not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit, especially in a city where there is a guild
for everything.
The doors are locked.
The windows are barred.
The dog does not appear to have woken up.
The squeaky floorboards haven't.
I really doubt that you are a ghost, and gods generally do not announce themselves so politely.
You could, of course, be Death, but I don't believe he bothers with such niceties.
Besides, I'm feeling quite well.
Hmm...
Good evening.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
You appear to be.. a spectre.
Our nature is not a matter for discussion.
We offer you a commission.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
- Our scale of fees...
- The payment will be $3 million.
- No questions asked, I assume.
- No questions answered.
But does the suggested fee represent the difficulty involved?
The client is heavily guarded?
Not guarded at all, but almost certainly impossible to delete with conventional weapons.
We like to know for whom we are working.
We are sure you do.
We need to know your name, or names, in strict client confidentiality, of course.
You may think of us as... the Auditors.
Really?
What do you audit?
Everything.
We maintain the logical order of the universe.
I think we need to know a little more than that.
We are the people with $3 million.
We need to know where, when, and, of course, who.
The location is not on any map and we need the task to be completed by sunrise tomorrow.
This is essential.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
But won't he be out on his rounds?
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!
Is this a joke?
We have no sense of humour.
There are some that say that this... person does not exist.
He must exist!
How else could you so readily recognise his picture?
And many are in correspondence with him.
He would be difficult to find.
You will find persons on any street who can tell you his approximate address.
Yes, of course, but as you say, they can hardly give a map reference.
Even then, how would the...
Fat Man be inhumed?
A glass of poisoned sherry, perhaps?
You misunderstand the nature of employment.
How do I misunderstand you exactly?
We pay, you find the ways and means.
- How can I contact you?
- We will contact you.
We know where you are.
We know... where everyone is.
- Winvoe?
- Yes, sir?
Is Mr Teatime still in the building?
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up, Tusker.
Up, Snouter!
Giddy up!
Wahey!
Go away.
I don't do that stuff any more.
Yes, Twyla?
I'm afraid of the monster in the cellar, Susan.
- It's going to eat me up.
- What, again?
Ye gods, there's a girl out here with a poker!
What are you doing?
Twyla said she's afraid of the monster in the cellar, Mrs Gaiter.
And you're going to attack it with a poker, eh?
Yes.
- Susan's our governess.
- She beats up monsters with a poker?
Actually, that's a very clever idea.
My daughter gets it into her head there's a monster in the cellar, you go in with a poker and make bashing noises while the child listens,
- and everything's alright.
- Is that what you're doing, Susan?
Yes, Mrs Gaiter.
This I've got to watch.
It's not every day you see monsters beaten up by a girl.
Come on.
Come in, Mr Teatime.
Carter, just put it on the table over there, will you?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll go and fetch another cup directly, sir.
- What?
- For your visitor, sir.
What visitor?
Oh, for when Mr Tea...
Mr Teatime?
It's pronounced...
Teh-ah-tim-eh, sir.
Everyone gets it wrong, sir.
How did you get in here?
Easily.
I got mildly... scorched on the last few feet, of course.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with... animals, sir.
I have a report here that says that you nailed Sir George's dog to the ceiling.
I couldn't have it barking while I was working, sir.
- Some people would have drugged it.
- Oh.
But I definitely fulfilled the contract.
I checked Sir George's breathing with a mirror, as instructed.
Apparently his head was several feet from his body at that point.
That was alright, wasn't it, sir?
It, erm lacked elegance.
I thank you, sir!
I'm always happy to be corrected.
I shall remember that... next time.
It was about the next time that I wished to talk.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
You don't have to worry.
She always wins.
Very well done.
Very p-sychological.
Clever idea, that, bending the poker.
I expect you're not afraid any more, eh, my girl?
No.
No.
Very p-sychological.
Susan says, "Don't get afraid.
Get angry."
Oh, well, er, thank you, Susan.
And now, if you'd all like to come back into the parlour...
I mean, the drawing room...
Dashed convincing, the way she bent the poker like that!
- Have they all gone, Twyla?
- Yes, Susan.
Good.
Mind the tail!
That's what we do to monsters.
Now it's back to bed for you, my girl.
Difficult, sir.
Certainly.
But I have devoted some... time to it, sir.
You mean you've actually sat down and thought out how to inhume the Hogfather?
Why, yes, sir.
And the Soul Cake Duck.
And Death, sir.
They're imaginary creatures.
Makes it a challenge.
I suppose I just see things differently from other people.
We may be able to see the complaint of Sir George's estate against you with regard to his dog rather differently,
and approve your graduation to full membership of the Guild.
Take the dark, sir?
Wear black, sir?
If you agree to undertake... this contract.
With due elegance, of course.
With elegance guaranteed, sir.
Er, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?
You have... actually applied yourself to a study of ways of killing Death?
Only as a hobby, sir.
But then some people might say that he is technically immortal.
Everyone has their weak points, sir.
It's gone six.
He's not coming.
- Let's go.
- Sit down, will you?
Assassins are always fashionably late, because of style, right?
What's this?
You never said anything about him being an assassin.
It's Teatime.
He's paying top rate.
We can wait for top rate.
Teatime?
I've heard he's... mental.
And he's got a funny eye.
What I don't understand is... how long has this place had waiters?
Good evening.
Do have another drink while we wait for the other members of our little... troop.
Susan, there's a monster under my bed again.
Oh!
Ow!
Ow!
That's a wizard.
No, I'm not.
I'm incognito.
Yeah, right.
You're just someone in a pointy hat.
Mr Sideney here is indeed a wizard.
A student, anyway.
This is my brother Banjo.
This is Chickenwire.
I didn't want to come!
Mr Sideney's down on his luck at the moment.
Hence his willingness to join our little venture.
So what's the job?
We don't do jobs.
We perform services.
And the service will earn each of you $10,000.
No one said anything about there being magic in all of this.
Well, I...
Do the voice on it!
- Do the voice on it!
- No!
- Not the voice!
- Hit it on the head with a poker.
- Not the poker!
- This is the friendly warning.
Understand?
Because it's Hogswatch.
What are you, a witch or something?
I'm just... something.
Now, you won't be around here again, will you?
Or we'll put your head under the blanket.
It's got fluffy bunnies on it.
Fluffy bunnies...
No!
Go away and stop bothering me.
That wasn't as much fun as the one last month,
You know, the one when you kicked him in the trousers.
Just go to sleep now.
- Locks.
- We have a locksmith.
- Who?
- Mr Brown.
And you can help me carry this.
It's rather heavy.
What is this?
This is my brother Banjo.
Does it do tricks?
No.
He can lift two men up in each hand, by their necks.
Yeah.
He looks like a volcano.
Really?
Wanna be fashionably late, do you?
I do so hope we're gonna be friends, Mr Medium Dave.
It really hurts to think I might not be among... friends.
And I suppose we might as well make a start.
Hello!
My name's Violet, and I have been your tooth fairy for this evening.
Here, there ain't nothing valuable, you know.
Nothing valuable, only a few bags of t-t-t-t...
Teeth?
I know.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
What's your name, sir?
Ernie.
Yes, Ernie.
Come along, gentlemen.
This is my friend Ernie.
He's gonna be our driver for tonight.
Put her in the back, Banjo.
Mister, I ain't rightly allowed to carry passengers, ya know.
Charlie'd give me a right telling off.
Oh, don't you worry about that.
We're all friends here.
Our mam said no hitting girls.
Only bad boys do that, our mam said.
Shut it!
Ssh!
Ernie here doesn't want to listen to our troubles.
Wh-Wh-Where to, mister?
You know the way, Ernie.
Behind the Unseen University.
Where the students of magic are still hard at work on the night before Hogswatch.
It's just a shame we don't have any radiation shielding, Busar.
You want radiation shielding, Mr Stibbons?
Advice from Hex, Bursar.
As the university won't supply us students with a thaumic particle accelerator, we've started to build our own.
Safety first and all that!
Dean, have you seen the Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic?
I need some urgent advice!
Ask the Chair of Indefinite Studies.
- Er...
Hmm...
- Lecturer in Recent Runes?
Well, you see, it all depends...
I don't know...
In my day, when I was an undergraduate,
I wouldn't have been studying on Hogswatch Night.
It's just not natural.
I'd have been sick twice by now.
Bursar?
- Bursar?
- Hello, Mustrum.
- Dean?
Oh, there you are.
- Archchancellor?
Members of the faculty, I've decided, as a Hogswatch present to myself, to open up the late Archchancellor Weatherwax's old bathroom.
So I don't have to sluice down with you fellas.
It's unhygienic.
You can catch stuff.
'Ere, I can't take you lot through the wall!
Listen, Ernie.
Ern.
You will take us through, or, and I say this with very considerable regret,
I'll have to kill you.
- If I take you through the wall...
- What's the worst that can happen?
You'll lose your job.
Whereas if you don't, you'll die.
Really, Mustrum, I think this is most unwise.
It said in the plans there was a bathroom.
You chaps are all acting as if it was some kind of torture chamber.
A bathroom designed by Bloody Stupid Johnson!
The late Bergholt Stuttley Johnson was the worst inventor in the world, Archchancellor!
Yes!
Well, not everything he made had a horribly fateful flaw.
I mean, think of that thing they use in the kitchen for peeling potatoes, for example.
You mean that thing with the brass plate saying "improved manicure device"?
Well, it's only water.
Even old Johnson can't do much harm with water.
Go to it, lad.
- So?
- Er...
Well, he just chucks it at the wall there
- and it goes "twing".
- Really?
May I try?
Ain't that nice, our Davey?
Yeah.
And then you just drive forward.
Right.
Quick, mind, cos it only stays open for a little while.
Thank you very much, Ernie, very much indeed.
Wasn't he dull?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
The Tooth Fairy?
Hah!
Another childish belief.
- Exactly.
- Very elegant.
- It is.
- You have to start somewhere.
Once you have their little minds in your grip, it's goodbye, Hogfather.
It's him!
- Could I give you a hand?
- Oh, yeah!
Oh!
Here, your fingers aren't half cold, mister.
Sorry.
What did he want to go and do that for, eh?
I did what he said!
He could've killed me.
Yes.
I always keep a nip on me these cold nights.
- Keeps me spirits up.
- Indeed.
How am I gonna explain all this, then, eh?
Sorry?
That was very rude of me.
I wasn't paying attention.
What am I gonna tell people?
Letting some blokes ride off in me cart, neat as you like...
That's gonna be the sack for sure.
There, at least, I have some good news, Ernest.
And then again, I also have some bad news.
So...
I'm dead, then.
Correct.
Now, tell me about these blokes who stole your cart and killed you.
Honestly!
Death gets worse and worse.
He seems to like humans.
So illogical!
But the beauty of the assassin's plan is that he can't interfere.
But Death can go everywhere.
No.
Not... quite... everywhere.
Great job, but you look a right tit wearing these helmets.
Hello.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
What's yours?
Albert, something is not right.
Too right.
This is the Mythological Persons room.
How can one of them die?
Soul Cake Duck.
The Tooth Fairy.
The Hogfather!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear!
Albert!
We may not have much time.
Oh, is anybody there?
I don't know what you're expecting me to say, but...
Ssh.
Questions first.
Babble...
later.
Now, Miss Bottler,
I'd like you to think of me... as a friend.
- How we doing, Mr Modo?
- Tanks are filled and I've stoked the boilers, Mr Archchancellor, sir.
You did read the sign on that door, Ridcully?
You mean the sign which said,
"Do not under any circumstances open this door"?
Surely it was sealed up for a reason.
Oh, he only wrote that to keep people out.
That's right.
That's what people do.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Hygiene!
That's the ticket.
I still haven't worked out where all the pipes lead.
Oh, we'll find out, don't you fear.
Man the pumps, Mr Modo, or dwarf 'em, of course, in your case.
She's a tooth fairy, but she's not "the" Tooth Fairy.
Ssh.
Teeth...
What do you expect in the Tooth Fairy's castle?
It gives me the creeps just thinking about it.
You don't have to think.
You just have to do what I said.
- All of 'em?
- Every last one.
- Put 'em in a pile.
- That's millions.
Mr Brown?
I want you to unlock every door you can find.
What's this really all about?
Does he believe in things like the Soul Cake Duck?
The Sandman?
The Tooth Fairy?
Yeah.
Even the Hogfather.
Cos after we're finished here, not even he will.
Onwards, Binky, to the Hogfather's Castle of Bones!
The first Hogswatch off in a thousand years, even if I'm going to have the mother of all hangovers in the mor...
And how can the Hogfather bring presents to everyone at the same time?
Unless there are lots of Hogfathers.
Look, you've always believed in the Hogfather, yes?
- Yes...
- Well, if you don't believe in him,
- he won't come down the chimney.
- It's a very small chimney.
And a very small stocking, if you don't go to sleep.
Ah, yes.
And, erm...
"Ho, ho, ho."
There's a tap in there marked Old Faithful which I think perhaps we might leave alone for now.
This is... a most peculiar Hogswatch.
Any mustard?
They're a treat with mustard.
Apple sauce.
I'm finding the beard a bit of a trial.
Well, at least it's keeping you in the right frame of mind, master.
In character, that sort of thing.
But going down the chimney...
Where's the sense in that?
It's gotta be chimbleys, innit, eh?
A bit like the beard, really.
Do you think these little buggers would be writing to someone who can walk through walls if they knew?
Oh, and that reminds me.
The "ho, ho, ho" could do with some more work, if you don't mind me saying so.
Ho, ho, ho?
No, no, no!
No, you've got to put a bit more life in it, sir.
Er, no offence intended.
You've got to do a big, fat laugh, sir, you know, like...
Ho, ho, ho!
Like that.
See?
You've got to sound like you're pissing brandy and you're crapping plum pudding, sir, if you'll pardon my Klatchian.
Really?
How do you know all this?
Well, I used to be young myself once, sir, surprising as it may seem.
- These teeth give me the creeps.
- Just keep going!
- Why are we piling them all up?
- You don't wanna know.
Quicker all the teeth are in a pile, quick we're out of here with our money.
No one ever laid a punch on Banjo since our mam died.
Tough but fair, your mam.
I recall that time she strangled Glossy Ron with his own leg.
Yeah.
Maybe the both of us could creep up on him and...
Yeah!
I keep thinking about that glass eye watching me.
I keep thinking it can see right in my head!
Don't worry.
He doesn't know what you're thinking.
How do you know?
You're still alive.
These damned eyeballs are hard, aren't they?
They're walnuts, not eyeballs.
I don't want you back in my life.
Understand?
Don't say you haven't been warned!
Warned?
Ah!
Did you check the list?
Couldn't really make head nor tail of it, to tell you the truth.
I don't normally care if they've been naughty or nice.
I can feel belief in the Hogfather fading.
- What's that?
- It looks very bad.
No, no.
It's just where something's been nibbling it.
I mean the situation.
I fear we may be too late.
Oh, well.
Never say die, master.
That's our motto.
I can't say it's ever really been mine.
You'd better watch out.
Because if the Hogfather still comes to town as result of a magical misjudgement on your part, then, you will no longer be my friend, Mr Sideney.
I... understand, sir.
Do you have a lot of friends,
Mr Sideney?
Erm... quite a few, actually.
I don't have many.
Don't seem to have the knack.
On the other hand, I don't seem to have any enemies at all.
Well it's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
That is... very... simple and will make the pile of teeth... very...
Mr Teatime!
... dangerous.
Grandfather, this is Hogswatch.
It's supposed to be jolly, with mistletoe and holly... and other things... ending in "olly".
It's a time when people are meant to feel good about things, and eat until they explode, a time when they want to see all their... relatives.
I mean, it's a time when humans are really human, and they don't want a...
a skeleton at the feast, especially one, I might add, who's wearing a false beard and has got a damn cushion shoved up his robe!
I mean, why?
Albert said it would help me get into the spirit of the thing.
This is a real job, and I was looking forward to a real Hogswatch where normal things happen with normal people in a normal house, and suddenly, the old circus comes to town.
Well, I don't know what's going on, but you can just leave right now.
Albert.
Buggery.
Master?
I'm stuck.
The pixie.
Oh, come along in, do.
If the real Hogfather doesn't turn up soon, there's not going to be enough room for him.
- Oh...
- He won't be joining us.
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons,
I will add then that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
The Hogfather is... unavailable.
- At Hogswatch?
- Yes.
Why?
He is...
Let me see.
There isn't an entirely appropriate human word, so, let's settle for gone.
Yes.
He is gone.
How can the Hogfather be gone?
He's..
Isn't he what you are?
Anth...
Anthropomorphic personification?
Yes.
He has become the spirit of Hogswatch.
And while he's gone, you've taken over.
That's sick.
I see the girl writes in green crayon on pink paper with a mouse in the corner.
The mouse is wearing a dress.
I ought to point out that she decided to do that so that the Hogfather would think she was sweet, including the deliberate bad spelling.
But look, why are you doing...
She says she is five years old.
Seven.
In cynicism, she's about 35.
But why are you doing the...
But she believes in the Hogfather.
She'd believe in anything if there was a dolly in it for her.
But you're not going to leave without telling me...
And what are you doing here, Albert?
I thought you'd die if you ever came back to the world.
Ah, but we are not in the world.
We are in the special congruent reality created for the Hogfather.
Normal rules have to be suspended.
How else could anyone get around the entire world in one night?
That's right.
I'm one of the Hogfather's little helpers, me.
It's official.
I've got the little pointy green hat with the bell and everything.
Have you been good, have you?
Now we must be going.
Happy Hogswatch.
And, er...
Oh, yes.
Ho, ho, ho.
Heh, heh.
It's a nice drop of sherry, this.
You've actually been drinking the actual drink little children leave for the actual Hogfather?
Well, yeah.
Why not?
He won't be drinking any more, will he?
Eh?
Not where he's gone...
How many have you had, may I ask?
Hmm?
Well, I dunno.
I haven't been counting.
One million, eight hundred thousand, seven hundred and six.
And sixty-eight thousand, three hundred and nineteen pork pies.
And one turnip.
Oh, yeah.
Well... it looked pork-pie shaped.
But then, everything does after a while, doesn't it?
Why are you doing this?
I am sorry, I cannot tell you.
Forget you saw me.
It's not your business.
Not my business?
How can you say...
You wanted to be normal.
Good night, granddaughter.
Sleep tight.
I know I shall.
Pardon.
There are a lot of doors.
I hope this is the one.
This isn't the room we're looking for.
Just teeth in here.
Keep going, Mr Brown.
Boo!
Susan will try to find out what this is all about, you know.
Oh, dear.
Especially after you told her not to.
You think so?
Oh, yes.
Dear me!
I still have a lot to learn about humans, don't I?
Oh, I dunno.
Obviously it would be quite wrong to involve a human in all this.
That is why, you will recall,
I clearly forbade her to take an interest.
Yes, yes, you did.
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- Yeah, well, of course, that's a shame, really, because she likes to break 'em, doesn't she?
You might think I've already thought of that, but I couldn't possibly comment.
Oh.
And we have much to do.
We have the Hogfather's promises to keep.
Has he done something to the real Hogfather?
Binky.
Can she be eliminated?
Oh, yes.
She's mostly human.
Oh, good.
Then, can we go back to just concentrating on running the universe, making sure that gravity works and that atoms spin?
Yes, when there's not an atom of belief left in the world.
And the Hogfather is just the beginning.
What are you looking for, Mustrum?
My father always said, when you see a lot of people bathing together, the Verruca Gnome is running around with his little sack.
Modo!
Any sign of the Verruca Gnome down there, old boy?
Welcome home, Susan.
You took your time!
I don't do family reunions.
Sandman.
Soul Cake Duck.
Tooth Fairy.
The Hogfather!
Grandfather, what have you done?
This cushion is still uncomfortable.
You're doing well, master.
Soot in the fireplaces, footprints, swigged sherries sleigh tracks all over the roofs.
No, no.
It's got to work.
You think so?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, here's a little tip, though.
"Ho, ho, ho," will do.
Don't say, "Cower, brief mortals!"
Oh.
Really?
So many chimneys...
It would be so much quicker if I lost the cushion.
Yeah, well I mean, if we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
Er, I mean the Hogfather.
So you've got to look the part, master.
I tell you what'd be really good to boost belief is a public appearance.
Oh, I don't normally do them.
Yeah, but the Hogfather's more of a public figure, master.
I tell you what, one good public appearance would do more good than any amount of letting the kids see you by accident.
Really?
And I know just the place.
Thank you very much indeed.
Everything tickety-boo, McPherson?
- Yes, Mr Crumley.
- Jolly good.
Let's go... sleigh them.
I don't know if you noticed, Albert, but that was a pune,
- or play on words.
- Ho, ho, ho, sir.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
You're frightening the little kiddies!
- Wow, they got tusks!
Cool!
- That one's doing a wee.
It's the Campaign for Equal Heights that have done this, isn't it?
They're out to ruin me!
That's it!
I don't mind the smell of the oranges and the damp trousers, but I ain't putting up with this!
And he's not even doing it right!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
Come on!
Who are you?
You can call me Uncle Heavy.
- You're not a pixie.
- No, I'm a fairy cobbler, mister!
Now, just ssh!
Keep quiet!
And what do you want for Hogswatch, small human?
The autobiographies write down everything that happens to you as it happens.
I know.
I used to live here, remember?
But I can't read this.
The letters are all... odd.
Oh, so I suppose now you'll be wanting my words of occult wisdom.
Ethereal runes.
The Hogfather ain't human, after all.
Er, I suppose a bit of warm liver's out of the question?
~ On the second day of Hogswatch
~ I sent my true love back
~ A nasty little letter
~ And a partridge in a pear tree
What's your game?
Small-time thief, are you?
You ain't supposed to be able to see me.
I'm a wizard!
We can see things that are really there, you know.
Oh, what's in this bag?
You'll really wish you hadn't, mister.
Oh, will I?
What are you doing here, young man?
Well, you know the Tooth Fairy?
Well, it's sort of like the same business.
- You take things away?
- Not take away as such...
More sort of bring.
- Ah.
Right, new teeth.
- Like new verrucas.
Oh, you're him.
I saw your piggy do a wee.
Oh?
Well... good.
It had a great big...
- What do you want for Hogswatch?
- She wants...
I want an army and a big castle with an active drawbridge and a sword.
I think they're supposed to say thank you.
Are you sure?
People don't normally.
No, I meant to the Hogfather, which is you!
Right?
- Sorry.
- Yes, of course.
You're supposed to say thank you.
Thank you.
And be good.
This is part of the arrangement.
- Yes.
- Then, we have a contract.
- Ah, verrucas, eh?
- Wish I knew why.
- Do you mean you don't know?
- No!
Suddenly I wake up and I'm the Verruca Gnome!
Why, how strange!
Anyway... amazing bathroom, isn't it?
It's even got a special pot for your toenail clippings.
- Special pot for your toenail clippings?
- Well, you can't be too careful.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clippings, hair, teeth, you've got them under your control.
I mean, that's real old magic.
Children of the world, prepare to think as you are told.
Mr Sideney?
Your big... no-misjudgements magic moment.
You can't give her that!
It's not safe!
It's a sword.
They're not meant to be safe.
- But she's a child!
- It's educational.
What if she cuts herself?
That will be an important lesson.
Really?
Oh, well.
It's not for me to argue, I suppose.
And she doesn't want all that other stuff.
She's a girl!
And anyway, I can't afford big posh stuff like that.
I thought I gave it away.
- You do?
- You do?
You don't!
That's our merchandise!
You don't just give it away.
Hogswatch isn't about giving everything away.
I mean, yes, you do give things away, but you have to buy them first.
You mean... this is all... free?
It... would seem... to be.
So, Mr Stibbons, this thing's a great big artificial brain, then, eh?
You could think of it like that.
Of course, Hex doesn't actually think, not as such.
- It just appears to be thinking.
- Amazing!
You mean it gives the impression of thinking, but really it's just a show?
- Er, yes.
- Just like everyone else, then, eh?
Oh, I knew I came here for something.
Now, this little chappie is the Verruca Gnome who's just popped into existence to be with us on Hogswatch Night, being the most magical night of the year.
Last year's occult rubbish piling up...
I thought you chaps might like to check up on it.
The Verruca Gnome?
Well, it makes about as much sense as anything else, doesn't it?
After all, there's a Tooth Fairy, isn't there?
Makes one wonder why there's a god of wine and not a god of hangovers.
Anyone hear a noise just then?
Sorry, Archchancellor?
A sort of...
Like a lot of, er... tinkling bells?
I didn't hear anything like that, sir.
Oh.
Well, where was I?
Erm...
Oh yes, well, I mean, nobody's ever seen a Verruca Gnome until tonight.
I've never heard of me until tonight, and I am me!
Well, erm, we'll see what Hex can find out, Archchancellor.
Good man.
Amazing!
Now we should be able to get to the bottom of all this.
None of this is right.
Everyone knows he's just a jolly old fat man who hands out presents to kids.
He wasn't always so jolly.
- You know how it is.
- Do I?
Well, it's like, you know, industrial retraining.
Even gods have to move with the times.
You see, your Hogfather was probably just your basic winter demiurge, you know, blood on the snow, making the sun come up...
So there has to be blood to make the sun come up?
Hmm!
Well, it starts off with animal sacrifice,
You know, hunt some big, hairy animal to death, that kind of stuff, very folkloric, very... mythic.
Didn't stop at animals, neither.
They had sacred kings, the strongest and the best, died at the dark time of year to give life to the unconquered sun.
And in a way, the Hogfather was all of 'em.
- And then?
- Then some bright spark thought,
"Aye, looks like that damn sun comes up anyway, so how come we're giving those Druids all this free grub?"
The world moves on, and he's gotta find a new job.
So he started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up?
Exactimundo.
And now he gives out presents.
Top of the evenin', squire.
I am Corporal Nobbs of the Watch, and this is Constable Visit, sir.
I want you to arrest him!
- Arrest who, sir?
- The Hogfather!
What for, sir?
He's sitting up there as bold as brass in his... grotto giving away presents!
Not quite up to speed here, sir.
I thought the Hogfather was supposed to give away stuff, isn't he?
But this one's... an impostor!
You know, I always thought that.
I thought, the Hogfather spends two weeks sitting in a wooden grotto in some shop in Ankh-Morpork, very busy time, too.
Nice life, eh?
He's not the Hogfather we usually have!
You mean a different impostor?
Not the real impostor at all?
Yes!
No!
Arrest the Hogfather style of thing?
- Yes!
- On Hogswatch Night?
- Yes.
- For giving away presents?
In front of all these kiddies?
Yes!
- In your shop?
- Y...
You think... that might look a bit... bad?
Difficult to see how it could look good, sir.
Could you not do it... surreptitiously?
Oh, well!
Yes.
Surreptition.
Yes.
We could give that a try.
You won't find me ungrateful.
In Omnia, we call Hogswatch Night the Fast of St Ossory.
But it is not an occasion for superstition and crass commercialism.
I used to hang up my stocking every Hogswatch, regular.
All that ever happened was my dad was sick in it once.
I'm going in.
There seems to be a thaumic surge from somewhere.
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
It's the expression on their little faces I like.
Yeah, a sort of cross between fear and and awe.
They don't know whether to laugh, cry or wet their pants.
Yes.
Now, that is what I call belief.
Next.
And what's your name, little person?
Nobby Nobbs, Hogfather.
And have you been a good bo?
A good dwa?
A good gno?
A good individual?
Yes.
So why isn't it working?
Ah, the chalk... just got a bit scuffed, you know, when we were piling up the... the things.
- You're sure that's what it is?
- Well, er...
What about the spell?
Oh, that'll go on forever.
Simple ones do.
It's just a state change, powered by the... the...
It just keeps going.
That's very good, Mr Sideney.
Because if the sympathetic magic doesn't work, you will find me very unsympathetic.
What happened?
What happened?
Ah, it's disgusting, this whole business!
It is the worship of idols!
It's a genuine Burleigh Stronginthearm double-action triple-cantilever crossbow with a polished-walnut stock and... silver engraved facings.
Aren't we going to arrest the impostor, Corporal?
You're foreign, Washpot.
I can't expect you to know the real meaning of Hogswatch.
On the whole, I think that went very well, don't you?
Yes, master.
And I think I've got the laugh working really well now.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Yes, sir.
Very jolly.
Tomorrow morning, they'll believe, alright.
They'd better.
Because if they don't, then there won't be a tomorrow morning.
So for the sun to come up tomorrow, the Hogfather has to be alive.
Precise-amente.
But what if he's dead?
And this was gonna be your big... moment.
It's him!
Such a shame!
Pretty lights...
Think... happy, Banjo.
Wake up!
Wake up!
You've got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
You're not the Hogfather.
There must be thousands here.
What's all this stuff?
It's just paper.
They're title deeds to properties, and they're better than money.
So if we steal them, do they become ours?
Is that a trick question?
Anyway, let's get going.
He won't miss a few, er...
- Gentlemen.
- We were just, er...
We were just... piling up the stuff.
Hah!
Hmm!
I know people say
I'd kill them as soon as look at them.
And in fact, I'd much rather kill you than look at you, Mr Lilywhite.
You're thinking that Banjo's gonna help you.
That's how its always been, isn't it?
But Banjo's my friend now.
Banjo has the heart...
of a little child.
And believe, I have, too.
Help him, Banjo.
As far as this goes, I really have no use for it.
It's only pillow money.
Something much more...
interesting has become apparent.
Albert...
I don't see the Hogfather as someone who rolls his own.
Drop him.
Control.
Control the inner child, and it'll even give you its teeth.
And somewhere in this tower, you're gonna help me find someone who can use it who can use it to... give me the world.
So, is he saying to take the money and go?
Don't be so bloody stupid!
Daddy?
I say...
It's not what you think!
Yes, it is.
Mr Brown?
There's one door you haven't found.
Find the Tooth Fairy's secret room.
And when he does then, just think what I can make the kiddiewinks think.
- Are you alright?
- I wish I was dead.
I think you may have come to the right place.
- Oh, my head...
- Are you the Hogfather?
I feel awful!
Have you got any ice?
Duty calls.
Yeah, but which one?
That one or this one?
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
Everything starts somewhere although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where.
Where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that, the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle, the great A'Tuin.
It was some time after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories of the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis.
"Things just happen.
What the hell?"
Our story began in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld, a city where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for Wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets below.
Our story continues in the middle of the night before Hogswatch, a midwinter festival, which, for some reason, bears a remarkable similarity to your Christmas, that now takes us to the Tooth Fairy's castle,
where magic has made children's teeth perilously powerful, so that our story is much sooner rather than later about blood.
Mr Teatime!
There you are.
I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
I'm not telling you anything.
Who are you, anyway?
I'm glad you asked.
I'm your worst nightmare.
Oh.
You mean the one with the giant cabbage and the, kind of, whirling-knife thing?
Sorry, no.
Not that one.
I'm the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you, stone dead.
Oh, that one.
But that's not...
Rather a charitable act there, I feel.
But it is nearly Hogswatch after all.
Bring me the girl.
Odd.
Oh.
It's a scythe job, then.
They took the teeth.
All of them.
They just walked in and they... they...
No!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
- Where did he come from?
- A place I cannot go.
Well, even if you could go there, we've got our work cut out here keeping the Hogfather's seat warm.
If what's happening in the Tooth Fairy's castle isn't stopped, then, everything we've been doing is a waste of time.
And if they get to the Tooth Fairy, they will be able to control all human belief.
Unless Susan gets there first.
Yes, well, it's coming along well.
Very impressive.
Well done.
- I need your help, Mr Ridcully.
- You...
You're...
Yes.
The scythe, the cloak, the white horse, the granddaughter.
I need you to wake him up.
His name's Bilious.
He's the Oh God of Hangovers.
Something nasty's happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is but he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you brought him here?
Why are you doing this?
- I mean, I was a bit behind with the teeth, I know...
- Is she behind this door?
I don't know.
There was nearly $13
- in pillow money owing, I admit.
- This her door?
But I signed the form G...
Will you just shut up and answer the question?
I don't know.
I've never been here before.
Then your boss probably doesn't realise how irritating you are.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Or Miss Bottler gets it.
It was only a bit of loose change!
And I really, I was going to... 10 Scrote...
Have you got the list?
This is really, really stupid.
I think the tradition got started when everybody had them big chimbleys, master.
Indeed.
It's only a mercy it's unlit.
The boy wants a pair of trousers that he doesn't have to share, a huge meat pie, a sugar mouse,
a lot of toys and a puppy called Scruff.
Aw, how sweet.
I shall wipe away a tear.
Cos what he's getting, you see, is this little wooden toy
- and an apple.
- But the letter clearly...
I know.
It's the socioeconomic factors.
I mean, the world would be in a hell of a mess, wouldn't it, if everybody got what they asked for?
I gave them what they wanted in the store.
Yeah, well, what good is a god that gives you everything that you want, eh?
- You have me there.
- Ah, yeah.
No, it's the hope that's important.
Oh, yes.
It's a big part of belief, is the hope.
I mean, say you give people jam today and they'll just sit there and eat it, won't they.
But jam tomorrow?
Ah, no.
That'll keep 'em going forever.
And you mean that because of this, the poor get poor things and the rich get rich things?
Well, yeah.
That's the meaning of Hogswatch, innit, master?
But I'm the Hogfather!
At the moment, I mean.
Well, it makes no difference.
I remember when I was a nipper.
It was one Hogswatch, it was and I had my heart set on this huge model horse in this shop.
It was what I always wanted.
Someone was in there, buying it, and, do you know, just for a second,
I thought it really was going to be for me.
But it wasn't.
I spent hours with me nose pressed up against the window, till someone heard me calling and unfroze me.
Yes, I would've killed for that horse.
But you know what?
I still hung up my stocking on Hogswatch Eve.
And do you know why?
Cos I had hope!
Yeah.
And the next morning, our dad had put in my stocking a little wooden horse that he had carved his very own self.
Ah, and that was worth more than all the expensive toy horses in the world?
No, cos you're a selfish little bugger when you're only seven.
It's only grown-ups that think like that.
This is wrong.
It is... unfair.
Well, that's life, innit, master, eh?
But I'm not.
This is supposed to be the season to be jolly.
- Hmm.
- And other things ending in "olly".
Please.
Just take her out of vocal range.
Mr Brown.
Your big moment.
Break me out the real Tooth Fairy.
Oh, come along, lad.
If you're the Lecturer in Recent Runes, can't you do something more, well, magical?
Well, Spold's Unstirring Divisor would do it.
You would end up with a large beaker filled with all the nastiness.
It's not difficult at all, if you don't mind the side effects.
Tell me about the side effects.
The main one is that the rest of him would end up in a somewhat larger beaker.
- Alive?
- Well, broadly, yes.
Living tissue, certainly.
And definitely sober.
Why don't we just mix up absolutely everything and see what happens?
It's got to be worth a try.
Ah.
Thank you, my dear.
A-ha!
Is this going to take much longer?
We may not have much time.
Oh, you can't be too careful.
- What's that?
- Ssh.
Wow-Wow sauce.
The hottest sauce in the universe.
And it'll blow your head clean off.
It's not safe to drink it if the sweat is still condensing on the bottle.
On the other hand, if it is a kill-or-cure remedy, then, we are, given the possibility that the patient is immortal probably onto a winner.
I wonder if it's gone critical yet.
I don't know.
I wish you fellas would show some backbone.
Careful, Archchancellor!
What you have there may represent pure sobriety.
I'll try it.
You did say he was immortal, didn't you?
- And you mean... he just appeared?
- Yes!
He has no memory of existing before appearing at the Hogfather's castle.
You mean, like this fellow?
Don't be ridiculous.
Gods and gnomes don't appear en masse for no reason.
Bring me, let's see,
20 pints of lager, some pepper vodka and bottle of coffee liqueur.
I didn't have you sobered up just so you could go on a binge.
- You don't drink.
- I don't?
Oh.
Yeah.
- I need you to help me.
- Oh.
I'm afraid I did it, didn't I?
I, erm, I said something to young Stibbons about drinking and hangovers, didn't I?
You mean you created it just like that?
Oh, I find that very hard to believe, Mustrum.
Good job nobody mentioned the Hair Loss Fairy, then!
I am not losing my hair.
It is just very finely spaced.
Yes, half on your head and half on your hairbrush.
For the last time, I am not...
I wish I knew where that was coming from.
We need a bigger brain for this.
That thinking engine of yours working, Ponder?
Er, Hex is resting, Archchancellor.
Can you hear me in there?
You don't have to shout, Archchancellor.
What is that "ning-ning, ning-ning, ning-ning" noise all about?
It says, "Look at the Dean."
"Look at the...
Dean."
Is there a problem?
- Are you the Hair Loss Fairy?
- Apparently.
What have you been doing with my hair?
Just a minute.
Where exactly were you before I found you in the snow?
Anywhere where drink had been consumed in beastly quantities sometime previously, you could say.
A-ha...
- So you were an imminent vital force, aye?
- Oh, sounds great!
What is that?
So, when we joked about the Hair Loss Fairy, it suddenly focused on the Dean's head.
You're calling things into being.
I personally have always wondered if there was an Eater of Socks.
You know how there's always one missing?
Ah!
To the laundry!
Tell me again who these people are.
Some of the cleverest men in the world.
And I'm sober, am I?
What is that ridiculous thing on your head?
I don't know, sir!
What?
What is it?
It says here...
"If found, please return to the Tooth Fairy's castle."
Well, thank goodness the Tooth Fairy already exists, hey?
Tooth Fairy?
Oh, you see her around a lot these days.
Or them, rather.
It's a sort of franchise operation to collect children's teeth in exchange for money.
And she has a castle.
She sounds great.
Actually, I do remember one thing.
When I appeared at the Hogfather's house, there was this drunken little fellow in a pointy hat.
I thought it was just the drink talking, but he did mention something about the permanent end of perpetual servitude for the little helpers of all fantasy personifications!
Including the Tooth Fairy.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
Where did you find this?
Is he alright?
I say, what is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's castle?
- Now I'm feeling normal, can I come with you?
- This is not a normal situation.
Look, I think I'd better tell you.
- My grandfather is Death.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Death.
You know, death.
The robes, the scythe, the white horse, bones.
Death.
But at the moment, he's acting rather strange.
I just want to make sure I've got this clear.
You think your grandfather is Death and you think he's acting strange?
Look, Death adopted my mother.
He then took on a human apprentice.
They fell in love and I'm the result.
This is fascinating.
Let's just say I picked up a few strange genetic knacks along the way.
- Now, that looks dangerous.
- I hope so.
- Wait!
I could help you!
- Would you be any good in a fight?
Yes, I could be sick on people.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Whoa!
- There he is!
Watch yourselves!
- We have to sort this out.
We can't have creatures popping into existence just because people are talking about them.
Unhygienic.
So, what is this implied creation, then?
"Humans have always ascribed random, seasonal, natural or inexplicable actions to human-shaped entities."
"Such examples are the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy and Death."
Well, that's all very well, but I'm damn sure there's never been an Eater of Socks or an Oh God of Hangovers.
I think it works like this.
What we're getting is the personification of forces,
- just like Hex said.
- A bit like the Hogfather?
Wa..wa..wa..wa..when you're a kiddie, it's a it's as good an explanation as any as where presents come from.
But why is it happening now?
"Beliefs causing new creatures to appear."
You could put it like that.
"There's a finite quantity of belief in the universe."
Well, certainly people can only believe in so many things.
"It follows that if a major focus of belief is removed, there will be spare belief."
Alright, then....
What are people not believing in all of a sudden?
"Out of cheese....... error."
"Melon.
Melon.
Melon."
"Redo from start."
It's Hogswatch.
I suppose the Hogfather is around, isn't he?
I like this job.
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
Excuse me.
Yes.
This will show them.
But Poor Little Match Girl dying in the snow is all part of the spirit of Hogswatch, master.
You see, people hear about it and they say,
"We might be as poor as a disabled banana and only can afford to eat mud and boots, but see how much better off we are than the Poor Little Match Girl!"
That makes them happy and grateful for what they have got.
I know what the spirit of Hogswatch is, Albert.
You're not allowed to do that.
The Hogfather can.
The Hogfather gives presents.
There's no better present than a future.
That's it.
I've had enough of this pixie lark.
I'm waiting for the Hogfather.
I'm in the dark, waiting for the Hogfather.
Me.
A believer in natural philosophy.
I can find the square root of 27.4 in my head.
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's not as if I've hung a stocking up.
.... be some point if...
Take her somewhere warm and give her a good dinner.
And I may well be checking up later.
Looks like we've been chosen to do a bit of charity.
Well, I don't call it very charitable, just dumping someone on people like this.
I dunno.
Some people wouldn't know the real meaning of Hogswatch if it jumped up and clocked 'em in the gob.
No!
This is a child's painting.
Twyla paints like that.
I painted like that.
Grandfather saved some of my draw...
Come on.
Let's find the house.
- What house?
- There's always a house.
I was told you were the best locksmith in the city.
Yes, but locks don't generally alter themselves while you're working on them, that's what I'm saying.
Are you the best or not?
No!
Not the dark!
Banjo.
I'm getting out of here.
There's something wrong with this place.
I made a big pile.
Do you want to come with me?
It's pretty here.
Mr Sideney.
Would he deliver to apes earlier than to humans?
Interesting point, sir.
Possibly you're referring to my theory that humans may have descended from apes.
A bold hypothesis, which, if the Grants Committee could just see their way clear to letting me hire a boat and sail around to the islands...
I just thought he might deliver alphabetically.
Let me see, now.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Hogfather, of course.
Erm... ho, ho, ho.
You look extremely thin in the face.
I...
I'm, er...
I'm a bit ill.
Oh.
- Terminally, I would say.
- Yeah.
A-ha!
It's a false beard.
- No, it's not.
- It's got hooks for the ears.
That must've given you a spot of trouble there.
A pillow!
I thought there were seven locks.
Yeah, but they're half magic, half real and half not there.
Then there's parts of 'em don't exist half the time.
And I thought you could open any lock anyone ever made.
Made by humans and most dwarves.
I dunno what made these.
You never said anything about magic...
That's a shame.
Then, really, I have no more need of your services.
- You may as well go back home.
- What about my money?
Of course.
You should get what you deserve.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr Tea Cup.
I'm leaving, right, with what's coming to me and you ain't stopping me.
Banjo certainly ain't.
I knew his old ma in the good old days.
You think you're nasty?
You think you're mean?
Ma Lilywhite'd tear your ears off and spit 'em in your eyes.
Cocky little devil.
I remember you when you was little, Banjo.
- I used to sit you on my knees.
- Banjo...
There you are.
Where's all these shadows coming from?
It's giving me the creeps!
And it's all your fault.
Oh, yeah?
So it wasn't you who said, "Wow. $10,000.
Count me in!"
Yeah, but I didn't know there was gonna be all this creepy stuff!
I wanna go home.
It's like dealing with a child!
Poor guy must have slipped.
Yeah.
Slipped.
That's the Tooth Fairy's castle?
- It's teeth.
- And I should be scared?
There's nothing that scary about teeth.
Did I say I was scared?
I must just be hungover again.
- Oh, no.
- They're only teeth.
Oi!
- Surely no one would try to...
- What is that?
It's such old magic, it isn't even magic any more.
If you've got a piece of someone's hair, nail clipping or tooth, you can control them.
Don't tell me someone's...
- What's that shadow?
- This place is alive.
And it's protecting itself.
So, what happened to the other fellow?
Well the Hogfather has enemies.
What did he do, miss a chimney?
There's, er, there's people down there, Mr Teatime.
Well, just do away with them.
Well, er, one of them's a girl.
Then, do away with them... politely.
Keep going.
Quicker.
It's after me!
Let me out!
- What was that?
- It's finding their nightmares.
Let me out!
It's after me!
Pull yourself together.
Look around.
There's nothing chasing you.
I thought it was the... wardrobe.
What wardrobe?
When I was a kid, we had this big... wardrobe.
And it had this... this...
On the door, it had this face!
And at night, it whispered things.
Who's that moving up there?
I think they saw us.
And if they're tooth fairies, there's been a really stupid equal-opportunities policy.
Right.
You go that way, I'll go this way.
- Why don't we stay together?
- What's got into you?
Hmm?
This is a children's place.
The rules are what children believe.
- Well, that's a relief.
- You think so?
It's impossible to die here.
My grandfather doesn't figure in a child's world.
That man who fell down the stairs looked pretty dead to me.
Oh, you die.
But not here.
You...
Let's see.
Yes.
You go somewhere else.
Away.
- Aren't you Susan?
- Yes.
And when you came for Twyla's last tooth, you were so shocked that I could see you.
- Oh, yes, and I saw...
- Look, we may not have a lot of time.
Is this... the Tooth Fairy?
A tooth fairy.
Do you... drink at all?
No, I don't.
Not touch alcohol at all?
Never.
My dad's very strict about that sort of thing.
Nice castle.
Can we get on?
Good.
Who brought you here, Violet?
I don't know...
Oh, but he's dressed like an assassin!
OK.
You two stay here.
I'll go find him.
And I'll look after Violet.
That's the fourth lock open.
I commend your expertise.
And the others?
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?
Logically, if you're the guardian of children's beliefs and this is your castle and I come across as securely locked a door as this then, not to thoroughly investigate would lack elegance.
What's that sound?
- What sound?
- That sound.
Like old scissors scraping.
Have you ever heard of the Auditors?
Well, I suppose that the Bursar might have done.
Not auditors of money.
Auditors of reality.
They are the civil service of everything.
And they want to get rid of us?
They want humans to be...
less creative.
The Hogfather is a symbol of this.
Strange thinking.
They hate the way humans make up stories about the universe.
I can't think why.
And you, why are you doing this job?
Someone must.
It is vitally important.
Before dawn, there must be enough belief in the Hogfather.
- Why?
- So that the sun will come up.
I seldom joke.
What sort of godding do you do?
Oh, I'm the, er, I'm the Oh God of Hangovers.
- A god of hangovers?
Oh, how awful.
- I suppose so.
You're more cut out to be one of those important gods.
- Oh!
- What's this, eh?
Lovers' Lane?
You leave him alone, you!
He's a god!
Dear me!
Out of thunderbolts, are we?
Well, you know, I've never killed a g...
What's the matter?
It's just a wardrobe, innit?
I don't want to see!
I don't want to see.
Hex was right, Archchancellor.
Hex?
Who is Hex?
Erm, he's the biggest thinker in the world.
I would like to meet this Mr Hex.
Quite a large thaumic reading, gentlemen.
I think he got here by magic.
Where did he go?
They say you are the biggest thinker in the world, but do you also believe?
Extend logically the result of the human race ceasing to believe in the Hogfather.
Will the sun come up?
Answer.
Correct.
How may this be prevented?
Answer.
"Regular and consistent belief."
Good.
I have a task for you, thinking engine.
Believe in the Hogfather.
Do you believe?
Answer.
Do you believe?
Answer!
Good.
Hmm.
Oh, no!
Let me see.
How old are you?
And have you been naughty or nice?
Hello.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
Bone handle.
Rather tasteless skull-and-bone decoration.
Death himself's second-favourite weapon.
Am I right?
Oh, my.
It must be Hogswatch.
This must mean that you are Susan.
The famous granddaughter.
Nobility.
I'd bow, but I'm afraid you'd do something dreadful.
Yes!
Yes!
Left-handed using a wooden pick.
It's so simple!
Ah!
Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh, I've managed to open the fifth lock.
No problem.
They're just based on Woddeley's Occult Sequence.
- How do you know who I am?
- Easy.
Twurp's Peerage.
Family motto, non timetis messor.
Your father was well known.
Went a long way very fast.
As for your grandfather, honestly, that motto, "fear not the reaper", is that good taste?
Course, you don't need to fear him, do you?
Or do you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who are you, anyway?
I beg your pardon.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Jonathan Teh-ah-tim-eh at your service.
You mean...
like around four o'clock in the afternoon?
No.
I did say...
Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Please don't try to break my concentration by annoying me.
- How are you getting on, Mr Sideney?
- Oh!
Er...
It's just according to Woddeley's Sequence, number six should be copper and blue-green light.
Do you think your grandfather will try to rescue you?
But now I have his sword.
You see, I wonder...
All fingers and thumbs, Mr Sideney.
Er, I've managed to open the sixth lock, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Really?
But it may not be all-important now.
Thank you, anyway.
You've been most helpful.
- Erm...
- Yes.
You may go.
Is that all you're here for?
A robbery, like a petty thief?
A thief?
Me?
I'm not a thief, madam.
No.
These gentlemen are thieves.
That's Medium Dave.
And Exhibit B is Banjo.
He can talk.
Oh!
Who are you?
I'm incognito.
You look like a wizard to me.
Did you suck your thumb when you were little?
Nope!
- Is that the Scissor Man?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Kids believe all kinds of crap, but I'm a grown-up now, so...
No more Hogfather.
And that's only the start.
I'll be able to make people believe anything I want.
What's this?
You said, "No more Hogfather."
He does know what we've been doing here, doesn't he?
You did tell him?
There's gotta be a Hogfather.
There's always a Hogfather.
- She did it!
She killed him.
- No, I didn't.
He...
- Did!
- Didn't.
- Did.
- What's this about the Hogfather?
I don't think he's dead, but Teatime has made him very ill.
Who cares?
When this is over, Banjo, you'll have as many presents as you want.
Trust me.
There has to be a Hogfather, else there's no Hogswatch.
- It's just another solar festival.
- Banjo and me are going.
Banjo, you're coming with me right now.
Grab her, Banjo.
It's all her fault.
Our mam said no hitting girls.
No touching them or pulling them hair.
She's not a girl.
She's a freak.
I think I know you, Teatime.
You're the mad kid they're all scared of, right?
- Banjo, I said grab her.
- Our mam said...
The kid who didn't know the difference between chucking a stone at a cat and setting it on fire.
I said shut up.
Get her, Banjo.
The kind of little boy who looks up dolls' dresses.
- I didn't.
- Our mam said...
Ah, to blazes with your mam!
What did you say about our mam?
I bet no one wanted to play with you.
- Not the kid with no friends.
- Banjo, you do as I tell you.
Our mam...
Our mam...
Our mam said...
Have you been a bad boy, Banjo?
You been letting him get into trouble again, our Davey?
You have, haven't ya?
No, Mam.
No, Mam!
You need a good hiding, Banjo.
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, Mam!
You been playing with girls again?
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, Mam!
Sorry, Mam!
Sorry!
No, Mam.
No, Mam!
No!
...
No!
Oh, no.
I don't think so.
This place gets into your head, doesn't it?
It... finds out how to deal with you.
But I'm in touch with my inner child.
It's so much fun.
No pulling girls' hair.
That's bad.
I'm gonna have so much fun with this.
So light.
You wouldn't dare use it!
My grandfather will come after you.
- He comes after everyone.
- He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
It doesn't work here.
There's no death here.
Hi, inner child.
I'm the inner baby-sitter.
Happy Hogswatch!
Is.. is.. he dead?
He's not breathing.
Breathing spell.
Breathing spell.
Spolt's forthright respirator, perhaps.
I think I've got it written down somewhere.
Come on, chaps.
Give me some space.
Excuse me... excuse me, but this is vitally important for the advancement of natural philosophy.
Did you see any bright lights?
Was there a shining tunnel?
What is all this, Mr Stibbons?
Put the damn quill away.
This must be the Unseen University.
And you're all... wizards.
There was a sword.
Oh, yes.
It's, er, fallen on the floor.
Did I do that?
I really must be off.
Well, he won't get far.
The main doors are locked, in accordance with Archchancellor Spold's rules.
- Won't get far?
- No!
While holding a sword which appears to be able to cut through anything?
You can get into trouble, hitting girls.
No playing with girls.
What am I gonna do now?
Hello, my dear.
No.
Sorry, dear?
You're not the Tooth Fairy.
Oh, I am, dear.
Oh, Grandma, what big teeth you have.
You've even got a shawl.
Oh, dear.
I don't understand, lovey.
You forgot the rocking chair.
I always thought there'd be a rocking chair.
I don't think you're real.
It's not a little old woman in a shawl running this place.
You're out of my head.
That's how you defend yourself.
You poke around in people's heads and find the things that work...
No.
It's horrible, but it doesn't frighten me.
I like spiders.
Dogs?
No.
I like rats.
Rats are fine.
Sorry, is anyone frightened of that?
I...
I...
You're a bogeyman, aren't you?
Not a.
The!
The first bogeyman.
- You look terrible.
- Thank you very much.
I mean ill.
I used to jump out on them and say, "Boo!" Yeah.
But then I got to like 'em.
Only children were frightened of me.
I mean, what's to be scared of?
Horns, bony arms.
But then I discovered that there were much worse things than me and I wanted to protect the children, keep them safe from all the really bad things.
So I built all this to be a safe place.
And the teeth?
If you leave all those teeth around,
- anything could happen.
- Anything nearly did.
So, you are the Tooth Fairy, then?
Yes!
I... ah..
Oh...
Then.. they came, stealing.
I'm too weak to look after them any more.
You don't die here.
Just get old.
Listening to the laughter.
Don't worry about the teeth.
I'll make them safe again.
Everything starts somewhere although many physicists disagree.
There is the the constant desire to find out where.
Where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that, the Discworld was formed drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle, the great A'Tuin.
It was some time after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories of the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis.
"Things just happen.
What the hell?"
And so our story begins in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld, a city where magic is just anotherjob, and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for Wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets.
Our story begins on a midwinter festival bearing a remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
And so it was...
the night before Hogswatch.
"And then Jack chopped down what was the world's last beanstalk, adding murder and ecological terrorism to the theft, enticement and trespass charges already mentioned, and all the giant's children didn't have a daddy any more. "
"But he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge, which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you are a hero, because no one asks inconvenient questions. "
And now, it's time for bed.
- Susan?
- Yes?
You know last week when we wrote a letter to the Hogfather?
- Yes?
- Well, will he really come?
And whers he coming here?
Does it matter, if you get the presents anyway?
Yes.
Well, if you don't believe in the Hogfather,
- there won't be any presents.
- Thought so.
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly fat man is about to deliver their presents not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit, especially in a city where there is a guild
for everything.
The doors are locked.
The windows are barred.
The dog does not appear to have woken up.
The squeaky floorboards haven't.
I really doubt that you are a ghost, and gods generally do not announce themselves so politely.
You could, of course, be Death, but I don't believe he bothers with such niceties.
Besides, I'm feeling quite well.
Hmm...
Good evening.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
You appear to be a spectre.
Our nature is not a matter for discussion.
We offer you a commission.
You wish someone inumed?
Brought to an end.
- Our scale of fees...
- The payment will be $3 million.
- No questions asked, I assume.
- No questions answered.
But does the suggested fee represent the difficulty involved?
The client is heavily guarded?
Not guarded at all, but almost certainly impossible to delete with conventional weapons.
We like to know for whom we are working.
We are sure you do.
We need to know your name, or names, in strict client confidentiality, of course.
You may think of us as...
the Auditors.
Really?
What do you audit?
Everything.
We maintain the logical order of the universe.
wonk ot deen ew kniht I .taht naht erom elttil a
We are the people with $3 million.
We need to know where, when, and, of course, who.
The location is not on any map and we need the task to be completed by sunrise tomorrow.
This is essential.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
But won't he be out on his rounds?
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!
Is this a joke?
We have no sense of humour.
There are some that say that this... person does not exist.
He must exist!
How else could you so readily recognise his picture?
And many are in correspondence with him.
He would be difficult to find.
You will find persons on any street who can tell you his approximate address.
Yes, of course, but as you say, they can hardly give a map reference.
Even then, how would the...
Fat Man be inumed?
A glass of poisoned sherry, perhaps?
You misunderstand the nature of employment.
How do I misunderstand you exactly?
We pay, you find the ways and means.
- How can I contact you?
- We will contact you.
We know where you are.
We know... where everyone is.
- Winvoe?
- Yes, sir?
Is Mr Teatime still in the building?
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up, Tusker.
Up, Snouter!
Giddy up!
Wahey!
Go away.
I don't do that stuff any more.
Yes, Twyla?
I'm afraid of the monster in the cellar, Susan.
- It's going to eat me up.
- What, again?
Ye gods, there's a girl out here with a poker!
What are you doing?
Twyla's afraid of the monster in the cellar, Mrs Gaiter.
And you're going to attack it with a poker, eh?
Yes.
- Susars our governess.
- She beats up monsters with a poker?
Actually, that's a very clever idea.
My daughter gets it into her head there's a monster in the cellar, you go in with a poker and make bashing noises while the child listens,
- and everything's alright.
- Is that what you're doing, Susan?
Yes, Mrs Gaiter.
This I've got to watch.
It's not every day you see monsters beaten up by a girl.
Come on.
Come in, Mr Teatime.
Can'ter, just put it on the table over there, will you?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll go and fetch another cup directly, sir.
- What?
- For your visitor, sir.
What visitor?
Oh, for when Mr Tea...
Mr Teatime?
It's pronounced...
Teh-ah-tim-eh, sir.
Everyone gets it wrong, sir.
How did you get in here?
Easily.
I got mildly... scorched on the last few feet, of course.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with... animals, sir.
I have a report here that says that you nailed Sir George's dog to the ceiling.
I couldn't have it barking while I was working, sir.
- Some people would have drugged it.
- Oh.
But I definitely fulfilled the contract.
I checked Sir George's breathing with a mirror, as instructed.
Apparently his head was several feet from his body at that point.
That was alright, wasrt it, sir?
Lt, erm lacked elegance.
I thank you, sir!
I'm always happy to be corrected.
I shall remember that... next time.
It was about the next time that I wished to talk.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inuming this gentleman?
You don't have to worry.
She always wins.
Hah!
Very well done.
Very p-sychological.
Clever idea, that, bending the poker.
I expect you're not afraid any more, eh, my girl?
No.
No.
Very p-sychological.
Susan says, "Don't get afraid.
Get angry. "
Oh, well, er, thank you, Susan.
And now, if you'd all like to come back into the parlour...
I mean, the drawing room...
Dashed convincing, the way she bent the poker like that!
- Have they all gone, Twyla?
- Yes, Susan.
Good.
Mind the tail!
That's what we do to monsters.
Now it's back to bed for you, my girl.
Difficult, sir.
Certainly.
But I have devoted some... time to it, sir.
You mean you've actually sat down and thought out how to inume the Hogfather?
Why, yes, sir.
And the Soul Cake Duck.
And Death, sir.
They're imaginary creatures.
Makes it a challenge.
I suppose I just see things differently from other people.
We may be able to see the complaint of Sir George's estate against you with regard to his dog rather differently, and approve your graduation to full membership of the Guild.
Take the dark, sir?
Wear black, sir?
If you agree to undertake...
this contract.
With due elegance, of course.
With elegance guaranteed, sir.
Er, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?
You have... actually applied yourself to a study of ways of killing Death?
Only as a hobby, sir.
But then some people might say that he is technically immortal.
Everyone has their weak points, sir.
It's gone six.
He's not coming.
- Let's go.
- Sit down, will you?
Assassins are always fashionably late, because of style, right?
What's this?
You never said anything about him being an assassin.
It's Teatime.
He's paying top rate.
We can wait for top rate.
Teatime?
I've heard he's... mental.
And he's got a funny eye.
What I don't understand is...
how long has this place had waiters?
Good evening.
Do have another drink while we wait for the other members of our little... troop.
Susan, there's a monster under my bed again.
Oh!
Ow!
Ow!
That's a wizard.
No, I'm not.
I'm incognito.
Yeah, right.
You're just someone in a pointy hat.
Mr Sideney here is indeed a wizard.
A student, anyway.
This is my brother Banjo.
This is Chickenwire.
I didn't want to come!
Mr Sideney's down on his luck at the moment.
Hence his willingness to join our little venture.
So what's the job?
We don't do jobs.
We perform services.
And the service will earn each of you $10,000.
No one said anything about there being magic in this.
Well, I...
Do the voice on it!
- Do the voice on it!
- No!
- Not the voice!
- Hit it on the head with a poker.
- Not the poker!
- This is the friendly warning.
Understand?
Because it's Hogswatch.
What are you, a witch or something?
I'm just... something.
Now, you won't be around here again, will you?
Or we'll put your head under the blanket.
It's got fluffy bunnies on it.
Fluffy bunnies...
No!
Go away and stop bothering me.
That wasrt as much fun as the one last month, the one when you kicked him in the trousers.
Just go to sleep now.
- Locks.
- We have a locksmith.
- Who?
- Mr Brown.
And you can help me carry this.
It's rather heavy.
What is this?
This is my brother Banjo.
Does it do tricks?
No.
He can lift two men up in each hand, by their necks.
Yeah.
He looks like a volcano.
Really?
Wanna be fashionably late, do you?
I do so hope we're gonna be friends, Mr Medium Dave.
It really hurts to think I might not be among... friends.
And I suppose we might as well make a start.
Hello!
My name's Violet, and I have been your tooth fairy for this evening.
Here, there ain't nothing valuable, you know.
Nothing valuable, only a few bags of t-t-t-t...
Teeth?
I know.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
What's your name, sir?
Ernie.
Yes, Ernie.
Come along, gentlemen.
This is my friend Ernie.
He's gonna be our driver for tonight.
Put her in the back, Banjo.
Mister, I ain't rightly allowed to carry passengers.
Charlie'd give me a right telling off.
Oh, don't you worry about that.
We're all friends here.
Our mam said no hitting girls.
Only bad boys do that, our mam said.
Shut it!
Ssh!
Ernie here doesn't want to listen to our troubles.
Wh-Wh-Where to, mister?
You know the way, Ernie.
Behind the Unseen University.
Where the students of magic are still hard at work on the night before Hogswatch.
It's just a shame we don't have any radiation shielding.
You want radiation shielding, Mr Stibbons?
Advice from Hex, Bursar.
As the university won't supply us students with a thaumic particle accelerator, we've started to build our own.
Safety first and all that!
Dean, have you seen the Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic?
I need some urgent advice!
Ask the Chair of Indefinite Studies.
- Er...
Hmm...
- Lecturer in Recent Runes?
Well, you see, it all depends...
I don't know...
In my day, when I was an undergraduate,
I wouldn't have been studying on Hogswatch Night.
It's just not natural.
I'd have been sick twice by now.
Bursar?
- Bursar?
- Hello, Mustrum.
- Dean?
Oh, there you are.
- Archchancellor?
Members of the faculty, I've decided, as a Hogswatch present to myself, to open up the late Archchancellor Weatherwax's old bathroom.
So I don't have to sluice down with you fellas.
It's unygienic.
You can catch stuff.
'Ere, I can't take you lot through the wall!
Listen, Ernie.
Ern.
You will take us through, or, and I say this with very considerable regret,
I'll have to kill you.
- If I take you through the wall...
- What's the worst that can happen?
You'll lose your job.
Whereas if you don't, you'll die.
Really, Mustrum, I think this is most unwise.
It said in the plans there was a bathroom.
You chaps are all acting as if it was some kind of torture chamber.
A bathroom designed by Bloody Stupid Johnson!
The late Bergholt Stuttley Johnson was the worst inventor in the world, Archchancellor!
Yes!
Well, not everything he made had a horribly fateful flaw.
That thing they use in the kitchen for peeling potatoes, for example.
The thing with the brass plate saying "improved manicure device"?
Well, it's only water.
Even old Johnson can't do much harm with water.
Go to it, lad.
- So?
- Er...
Well, he just chucks it at the wall there
- and it goes "twing".
- Really?
May I try?
Oh!
Ain't that nice, our Davey?
Yeah.
And then you just drive forward.
Right.
Quick, mind, cos it only stays open for a little while.
Thank you very much, Ernie, very much indeed.
Wasrt he dull?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
The Tooth Fairy?
Another childish belief.
- Exactly.
- Very elegant.
- It is.
- You have to start somewhere.
Once you have their little minds in your grip, it's goodbye, Hogfather.
It's him!
- Could I give you a hand?
- Oh, yeah!
Oh!
Here, your fingers aren't half cold, mister.
Sorry.
What did he want to go and do that for, eh?
I did what he said!
He could've killed me.
Yes.
I always keep a nip on me these cold nights.
- Keeps me spirits up.
- Indeed.
How am I gonna explain all this, then, eh?
Sorry?
That was very rude of me.
I wasrt paying attention.
What am I gonna tell people?
Letting some blokes ride off in me can't, neat as you like...
That's gonna be the sack for sure.
There, at least, I have some good news, Ernest.
And then again, I also have some bad news.
So...
I'm dead, then.
Correct.
Now, tell me about these blokes who stole your can't and killed you.
Honestly!
Death gets worse and worse.
He seems to like humans.
So illogical!
But the beauty of the assassirs plan is that he can't interfere.
But Death can go everywhere.
No.
Not... quite... everywhere.
Great job, but you look a right tit wearing these helmets.
Hello.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
What's yours?
Albert, something is not right.
Too right.
This is the Mythological Persons room.
How can one of them die?
Soul Cake Duck.
The Tooth Fairy.
The Hogfather!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear!
Albert!
We may not have much time.
Oh, is anybody there?
I don't know what you're expecting me to say, but...
Ssh.
Questions first.
Babble...
later.
Now, Miss Bottler,
I'd like you to think of me...
as a friend.
- How we doing, Mr Modo?
- Tanks are filled and I've stoked the boilers, Mr Archchancellor, sir.
You did read the sign on that door, Ridcully?
You mean the sign which said,
"Do not under any circumstances open this door"?
Surely it was sealed up for a reason.
Oh, he only wrote that to keep people out.
That's right.
That's what people do.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Hygiene!
That's the ticket.
I still haven't worked out where all the pipes lead.
Oh, we'll find out, don't you fear.
Man the pumps, Mr Modo, all two of them, of course, in your case.
She's a tooth fairy, but she's not the Tooth Fairy.
Ssh.
Teeth...
What do you expect in the Tooth Fairy's castle?
It gives me the creeps just thinking about it.
You don't have to think.
You just have to do what I said.
- All of 'em?
- Every last one.
- Put 'em in a pile.
- That's millions.
Mr Brown?
I want you to unlock every door you can find.
What's this really all about?
Does he believe in things like the Soul Cake Duck?
The Sandman?
The Tooth Fairy?
Yeah.
Even the Hogfather.
Cos after we're finished here, not even he will.
Onwards, Binky, to the Hogfather's Castle of Bones!
The first Hogswatch off in a thousand years, even if I'm going to have the mother of all hangovers in the mor...
How can the Hogfather bring presents to everyone at the same time?
Unless there are lots of Hogfathers.
Look, you've always believed in the Hogfather, yes?
- Yes...
- Well, if you don't believe in him,
- he won't come down the chimney.
- It's a very small chimney.
And a very small stocking, if you don't go to sleep.
Ah, yes.
And, erm...
"Ho, ho, ho. "
Ooh!
There's a tap in there marked Old Faithful which I think perhaps we might leave alone for now.
This is...
a most peculiar Hogswatch.
Any mustard?
They're a treat with mustard.
Apple sauce.
I'm finding the beard a bit of a trial.
Well, at least it's keeping you in the right frame of mind, master.
In character, that sort of thing.
But going down the chimney...
Where's the sense in that?
It's gotta be chimbleys, innit, eh?
A bit like the beard, really.
Would these little buggers write to someone who can walk through walls if they knew?
Oh, and that reminds me.
The "ho, ho, ho" could do with some more work, if you don't mind me saying so.
Ho, ho, ho?
No, no, no!
No, you've got to put a bit more life in it, sir.
Er, no offence intended.
You've got to do a big, fat laugh, sir, you know, like...
Ho, ho, ho!
Like that.
See?
You've got to sound like you're pissing brandy and you're crapping plum pudding, sir, if you'll pardon my Klatchian.
Really?
How do you know all this?
Well, I used to be young myself once, sir, surprising as it may seem.
- These teeth give me the creeps.
- Just keep going!
- Why are we piling them all up?
- You don't wanna know.
The quicker the teeth are in a pile, the quicker we're out of here with our money.
No one ever laid a punch on Banjo since our mam died.
Tough but fair, your mam.
I recall that time she strangled Glossy Ron with his own leg.
Yeah.
Maybe the both of us could creep up on him and...
Yeah!
I keep thinking about that glass eye watching me.
I keep thinking it can see right in my head!
Don't worry.
He doesn't know what you're thinking.
How do you know?
You're still alive.
These damned eyeballs are hard, aren't they?
They're walnuts, not eyeballs.
I don't want you back in my life.
Understand?
Don't say you haven't been warned!
Warned?
Ah!
Did you check the list?
Couldrt really make head nor tail of it, to tell you the truth.
I don't normally care if they've been naughty or nice.
I can feel belief in the Hogfather fading.
- What's that?
- It looks very bad.
No, no.
It's just where something's been nibbling it.
I mean the situation.
I fear we may be too late.
Oh, well.
Never say die, master.
That's our motto.
I can't say it's ever really been mine.
You'd better watch out.
Because if the Hogfather still comes to town as result of a magical misjudgement on your part, then, you will no longer be my friend, Mr Sideney.
I... understand, sir.
Do you have a lot of friends,
Mr Sideney?
Erm... quite a few, actually.
I don't have many.
Don't seem to have the knack.
On the other hand, I don't seem to have any enemies at all.
Well it's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
That is... very... simple and will make the pile of teeth...
very...
Mr Teatime!
...dangerous.
Grandfather, this is Hogswatch.
It's supposed to be jolly, with mistletoe and holly... and other things...
ending in "olly".
It's a time when people are meant to feel good about things, and eat until they explode, a time when they want to see all their... relatives.
I mean, it's a time when humans are really human, and they don't want a... a skeleton at the feast, especially one, I might add, who's wearing a false beard and has got a damn cushion shoved up his robe!
I mean, why?
Albert said it would help me get into the spirit of the thing.
This is a real job, and I was looking forward to a real Hogswatch where normal things happen with normal people in a normal house, and suddenly, the old circus comes to town.
I don't know what's going on, but you can just leave right now.
Oh!
Albert.
Buggery.
Master?
I'm stuck.
The pixie.
Oh, come along in, do.
If the real Hogfather doesn't turn up soon, there's not going to be enough room for him.
- Oh...
- He won't be joining us.
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons,
I will add that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
The Hogfather is... unavailable.
- At Hogswatch?
- Yes.
Why?
He is...
Let me see.
There isn't an entirely appropriate human word, so, let's settle for gone.
Yes.
He is gone.
How can the Hogfather be gone?
Isn't he what you are?
Anth...
Anthropomorphic personification?
Yes.
He has become the spirit of Hogswatch.
And while he's gone, you've taken over.
That's sick.
I see the girl writes in green crayon on pink paper with a mouse in the corner.
The mouse is wearing a dress.
She decided to do that so that the Hogfather would think she was sweet, including the deliberate bad spelling.
But why are you doing...
She says she is five years old.
Seven.
In cynicism, she's about 35.
But why are you doing the...
But she believes in the Hogfather.
She'd believe in anything if there was a dolly in it for her.
But you're not going to leave without telling me...
And what are you doing here, Albert?
I thought you'd die if you ever came back to the world.
Ah, but we are not in the world.
We are in the special congruent reality created for the Hogfather.
Normal rules have to be suspended.
How else could anyone get around the entire world in one night?
That's right.
I'm one of the Hogfather's little helpers, me.
It's official.
I've got the little pointy green hat with the bell and everything.
Have you been good, have you?
Now we must be going.
Happy Hogswatch.
And, er...
Oh, yes.
Ho, ho, ho.
It's a nice drop of sherry, this.
You've actually been drinking the actual drink little children leave for the actual Hogfather?
Well, yeah.
Why not?
He won't be drinking any more, will he?
Eh?
Not where he's gone...
How many have you had, may I ask?
Hmm?
Well, I dunno.
I haven't been counting.
One million, eight hundred thousand, seven hundred and six.
And sixty- eight thousand, three hundred and nineteen pork pies.
And one turnip.
Oh, yeah.
Well... it looked pork-pie shaped.
But then, everything does after a while.
Why are you doing this?
I am sorry, I cannot tell you.
Forget you saw me.
It's not your business.
Not my business?
How can you say...
You wanted to be normal.
Good night, granddaughter.
Sleep tight.
I know I shall.
Pardon.
There are a lot of doors.
I hope this is the one.
This isn't the room we're looking for.
Just teeth in here.
Keep going, Mr Brown.
Ohh!
Susan will try to find out what this is all about, you know.
Oh, dear.
Especially after you told her not to.
You think so?
Oh, yes.
Dear me!
I still have a lot to learn about humans, don't I?
Oh, I dunno.
Obviously it would be quite wrong to involve a human in all this.
That is why, you will recall,
I clearly forbade her to take an interest.
Yes, yes, you did.
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- That's a shame, really, because she likes to break 'em, doesn't she?
You might think I've already thought of that, but I couldn't possibly comment.
Oh.
And we have much to do.
We have the Hogfather's promises to keep.
Right.
Has he done something to the real Hogfather?
Binky.
Can she be eliminated?
Oh, yes.
She's mostly human.
Oh, good.
Then, can we go back to just concentrating on running the universe, making sure that gravity works and that atoms spin?
Yes, when there's not an atom of belief left in the world.
And the Hogfather is just the beginning.
What are you looking for, Mustrum?
My father always said, when you see a lot of people bathing together, the Verruca Gnome is running around with his little sack.
Modo!
Any sign of the Verruca Gnome down there, old boy?
Welcome home, Susan.
You took your time!
I don't do family reunions.
Sandman.
Soul Cake Duck.
Tooth Fairy.
The Hogfather!
Grandfather, what have you done?
This cushion is still uncomfortable.
You're doing well, master.
Soot in the fireplaces, footprints, swigged sherries sleigh tracks all over the roofs.
No, no.
It's got to work.
You think so?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, here's a little tip, though.
"Ho, ho, ho," will do.
Don't say, "Cower, brief mortals!"
Oh.
Really?
Hmm.
So many chimneys...
It would be so much quicker if I lost the cushion.
If we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
Er, I mean the Hogfather.
So you've got to look the part, master.
I tell you what'd be really good to boost belief is a public appearance.
Oh, I don't normally do them.
Yeah, but the Hogfather's more of a public figure, master.
I tell you what, one good public appearance would do more good than any amount of letting the kids see you by accident.
Really?
And I know just the place.
Thank you very much indeed.
Everything tickety-boo, McPherson?
- Yes, Mr Crumley.
- Jolly good.
Let's go... sleigh them.
I don't know if you noticed, Albert, but that was a pune,
- or play on words.
- Ho, ho, ho, sir.
Oh!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
You're frightening the little kiddies!
- Wow, they got tusks!
Cool!
- That one's doing a wee.
It's the Campaign for Equal Heights that have done this, isn't it?
They're out to ruin me!
That's it!
I don't mind the smell of the oranges and the damp trousers, but I ain't putting up with this!
And he's not even doing it right!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
Come on!
Who are you?
You can call me Uncle Heavy.
- You're not a pixie.
- No, I'm a fairy cobbler, mister!
Now, just ssh!
Keep quiet!
And what do you want for Hogswatch, small human?
The autobiographies write down everything that happens to you as it happens.
I know.
I used to live here, remember?
But I can't read this.
The letters are all... odd.
Oh, so I suppose now you'll be wanting my words of occult wisdom.
Ethereal runes.
The Hogfather ain't human, after all.
Er, I suppose a bit of warm liver's out of the question?
What's your game?
Small-time thief, are you?
You ain't supposed to be able to see me.
I'm a wizard!
We can see things that are really there, you know.
Er, what's in this bag?
You'll really wish you hadrt, mister.
Oh, will I?
What are you doing here, young man?
Well, you know the Tooth Fairy?
Well, it's sort of like the same business.
- You take things away?
- Not take away as such...
More sort of bring.
- Ah.
Right, new teeth.
- Like new verrucas.
Ugh!
Oh, you're him.
I saw your piggy do a wee.
Oh?
Well... good.
It had a great big...
- What do you want for Hogswatch?
- She wants...
I want an army and a big castle with an active drawbridge and a sword.
I think they're supposed to say thank you.
Are you sure?
People don't normally.
No, I meant to the Hogfather, which is you!
Right?
- Sorry.
- Yes, of course.
You are supposed to say thank you.
'Nk you.
And be good.
This is part of the arrangement.
- Yes.
- Then, we have a contract.
- Ah, verrucas, eh?
- Wish I knew why.
- Do you mean you don't know?
- No!
Suddenly I wake up and I'm the Verruca Gnome!
Why, how strange!
Anyway...
amazing bathroom, isn't it?
It's even got a special pot for your toenail clippings.
- For your toenail clippings?
- Well, you can't be too careful.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clippings, hair, teeth, you've got them under your control.
I mean, that's real old magic.
Children of the world, prepare to think as you are told.
Mr Sideney?
Your big... no-misjudgements magic moment.
You can't give her that!
It's not safe!
It's a sword.
They're not meant to be safe.
- But she's a child!
- It's educational.
What if she cuts herself?
That will be an important lesson.
Really?
Oh, well.
It's not for me to argue, I suppose.
And she doesn't want all that other stuff.
She's a girl!
And anyway, I can't afford big posh stuff like that.
I thought I gave it away.
- You do?
- You do?
You don't!
That's our merchandise!
You don't just give it away.
Hogswatch isn't about giving everything away.
I mean, yes, you do give things away, but you have to buy them first.
You mean... this is all... free?
Lt... would seem... to be.
So, Mr Stibbons, this thing's a great big artificial brain, then, eh?
You could think of it like that.
Of course, Hex doesn't actually think, not as such.
- It just appears to be thinking.
- Amazing!
You mean it gives the impression of thinking, but it's just a show?
- Er, yes.
- Just like everyone else, then, eh?
I knew I'd come here for something.
Now, this little chappie is the Verruca Gnome who's just popped into existence to be with us on Hogswatch Night, being the most magical night of the year.
Last year's occult rubbish piling up...
I thought you chaps might like to check up on it.
The Verruca Gnome?
Well, it makes about as much sense as anything else, doesn't it?
After all, there's a Tooth Fairy, isn't there?
Makes one wonder why there's a god of wine and not a god of hangovers.
Anyone hear a noise just then?
Sorry, Archchancellor?
A sort of...
Like a lot of, er... tinkling bells?
I didn't hear anything like that, sir.
Oh.
Well, where was I?
Erm...
Yes, well, I mean, nobody's ever seen a Verruca Gnome until tonight.
I've never heard of me until tonight, and I am me!
Well, erm, we'll see what Hex can find out, Archchancellor.
Good man.
Amazing!
Now we should be able to get to the bottom of all this.
None of this is right.
Everyone knows he's just a jolly old fat man who hands out presents to kids.
He wasrt always so jolly.
- You know how it is.
- Do I?
Well, it's like, you know, industrial retraining.
Even gods have to move with the times.
You see, your Hogfather was probably just your basic winter demiurge, you know, blood on the snow, making the sun come up...
So there has to be blood to make the sun come up?
Hmm!
Well, it starts off with animal sacrifice, hunt some big, hairy animal to death, that kind of stuff, very folkloric, very... mythic.
Didrt stop at animals, neither.
They had sacred kings, the strongest and the best, died at the dark time of year to give life to the unconquered sun.
And in a way, the Hogfather was all of 'em.
- And then?
- Then some bright spark thought,
"Looks like that damn sun comes up anyway, so how come we're giving those Druids all this free grub?"
The world moves on, and he's got to find a new job.
So he started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up?
Exactimundo.
And now he gives out presents.
Top of the evenir, squire.
I am Corporal Nobbs of the Watch, and this is Constable Visit, sir.
I want you to arrest him!
- Arrest who, sir?
- The Hogfather!
What for, sir?
He's sitting up there as bold as brass in his... grotto giving away presents!
Not quite up to speed here, sir.
I thought the Hogfather was supposed to give away stuff.
But this one's... an impostor!
You know, I always thought that.
I thought, the Hogfather spends two weeks sitting in a wooden grotto in some shop in Ankh-Morpork, very busy time, too.
Nice life, eh?
He's not the Hogfather we usually have!
You mean a different impostor?
Not the real impostor at all?
Yes!
No!
Arrest the Hogfather style of thing?
- Yes!
- On Hogswatch Night?
- Yes.
- For giving away presents?
In front of all these kiddies?
Yes!
- In your shop?
- Y...
You think...
that might look a bit... bad?
Difficult to see how it could look good, sir.
Could you not do it...
surreptitiously?
Oh, well!
Yes.
Surreptition.
Yes.
We could give that a try.
You won't find me ungrateful.
In Omnia, we call Hogswatch Night the Fast of St Ossory.
But it is not an occasion for superstition and crass commercialism.
I used to hang up my stocking every Hogswatch, regular.
All that ever happened was my dad was sick in it once.
I'm going in.
There seems to be a thaumic surge from somewhere.
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
It's the expression on their little faces I like.
Yeah, a sort of cross between fear and and awe.
They don't know whether to laugh, cry or wet their pants.
Yes.
Now, that is what I call belief.
Next.
And what's your name, little person?
Nobby Nobbs, Hogfather.
And have you been a good bo...?
A good dwa...?
A good gno...?
A good individual?
Yes.
So why isn't it working?
Er, the chalk...
just got a bit scuffed, you know, when we were piling up the... the things.
- You're sure that's what it is?
- Well, er...
What about the spell?
That'll go on forever.
Simple ones do.
It's just a state change, powered by the... the...
It just keeps going.
That's very good, Mr Sideney.
Because if the sympathetic magic doesn't work, you will find me very unsympathetic.
What happened?
What happened?
Ah, it's disgusting, this whole business!
It is the worship of idols!
It's a genuine Burleigh Stronginthearm double-action triple-cantilever crossbow with a polished-walnut stock and... silver engraved facings.
Arert we going to arrest the impostor, Corporal?
You're foreign, Washpot.
I can't expect you to know the real meaning of Hogswatch.
On the whole, I think that went very well, don't you?
Yes, master.
And I think I've got the laugh working really well now.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Yes, sir.
Very jolly.
Tomorrow morning, they'll believe, alright.
They'd better.
Because if they don't, then, there won't be a tomorrow morning.
So for the sun to come up tomorrow, the Hogfather has to be alive.
Precise-amente.
But what if he's dead?
And this was gonna be your big... moment.
It's him!
Such a shame!
Pretty lights...
Think... happy, Banjo.
Wake up!
Wake up!
You've got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
You're not the Hogfather.
There must be thousands here.
What's all this stuff?
It's just paper.
They're title deeds to properties, and they're better than money.
So if we steal them, do they become ours?
Is that a trick question?
Anyway, let's get going.
He won't miss a few, er...
- Gentlemen.
- We were just, er...
We were just... piling up the stuff.
Hah!
Hmm!
I know people say
I'd kill them as soon as look at them.
In fact, I'd much rather kill you than look at you, Mr Lilywhite.
You're thinking that Banjo's gonna help you.
That's how its always been, isn't it?
But Banjo's my friend now.
Banjo has the heart...
of a little child.
And believe, I have, too.
Help him, Banjo.
As far as this goes, I really have no use for it.
It's only pillow money.
Something much more... interesting has become apparent.
Albert...
I don't see the Hogfather as someone who rolls his own.
Drop him.
Control.
Control the inner child, and it'll even give you its teeth.
And somewhere in this tower, you're gonna help me find someone who can use it who can use it to...
give me the world.
So, is he saying to take the money and go?
Don't be so bloody stupid!
Daddy?
I say...
It's not what you think!
Yes, it is.
Mr Brown?
There's one door you haven't found.
Find the Tooth Fairy's secret room.
And when he does then, just think what I can make the kiddiewinks think.
- Are you alright?
- I wish I was dead.
I think you may have come to the right place.
- Oh, my head...
- Are you the Hogfather?
I feel awful!
Have you got any ice?
Duty calls.
Yeah, but which one?
That one or this one?
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
Everything starts somewhere although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where.
Where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that, the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle, the great A'Tuin.
It was some time after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories of the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis.
"Things just happen.
What the hell?"
Our story began in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld, a city where magic is just anotherjob and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for Wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets below.
Our story continues in the middle of the night before Hogswatch, a midwinter festival, which, for some reason, bears a remarkable similarity to your Christmas, that now takes us to the Tooth Fairy's castle,
where magic has made childrers teeth perilously powerful, so that our story is much sooner rather than later about blood.
Mr Teatime!
There you are.
I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
I'm not telling you anything.
Who are you, anyway?
I'm glad you asked.
I'm your worst nightmare.
Oh.
You mean the one with the giant cabbage and the, kind of, whirling-knife thing?
Sorry, no.
Not that one.
I'm the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you, stone dead.
Oh.
Oh, that one.
But that's not...
Rather a charitable act there, I feel.
But it is nearly Hogswatch after all.
Bring me the girl.
Odd.
Oh.
It's a scythe job, then.
They took the teeth.
All of them.
They just walked in and they... they...
No!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
- Where did he come from?
- A place I cannot go.
Well, even if you could go there, we've got our work cut out here keeping the Hogfather's seat warm.
If what's happening in the Tooth Fairy's castle isn't stopped, then, everything we've been doing is a waste of time.
And if they get to the Tooth Fairy, they will be able to control all human belief.
Unless Susan gets there first.
Yes, well, it's coming along well.
Very impressive.
Well done.
- I need your help, Mr Ridcully.
- You...
You're...
Yes.
The scythe, the cloak, the white horse, the granddaughter.
I need you to wake him up.
His name's Bilious.
He's the Oh God of Hangovers.
Something nasty's happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is but he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you brought him here?
Why are you doing this?
- I was behind with the teeth...
- Is she behind this door?
Don't know.
There was nearly $13
- in pillow money owing.
- This her door?
But I filed the form...
Will you just shut up and answer the question?
I don't know.
I've never been here before.
Then, your boss probably doesn't realise how irritating you are.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Or Miss Bottler gets it.
It was only a bit of loose change!
And I really, I was going to... 10 Scrote...
Have you got the list?
This is really, really stupid.
I think the tradition got started when everybody had them big chimbleys, master.
Ooh!
Indeed.
It's only a mercy it's unlit.
Oof!
The boy wants a pair of trousers that he doesn't have to share, a huge meat pie, a sugar mouse, a lot of toys and a puppy called Scruff.
Aw, how sweet.
I shall wipe away a tear.
Cos what he's getting, you see, is this little wooden toy
- and an apple.
- But the letter clearly...
I know.
It's the socioeconomic factors.
I mean, the world would be in a hell of a mess, wouldn't it, if everybody got what they asked for?
I gave them what they wanted in the store.
What good is a god that gives you everything that you want?
- You have me there.
- Ah, yeah.
No, it's the hope that's important.
Oh, yes.
It's a big part of belief, is the hope.
I mean, say you give people jam today and they'll just sit there and eat it.
But jam tomorrow?
Ah, no.
That'll keep 'em going forever.
And you mean that because of this, the poor get poor things and the rich get rich things?
Well, yeah.
It's the meaning of Hogswatch, innit, master?
But I'm the Hogfather!
At the moment, I mean.
Well, it makes no difference.
Hmm.
I remember when I was a nipper.
It was one Hogswatch, it was and I had my heart set on this huge model horse in this shop.
It was what I always wanted.
Someone was in there, buying it, and, do you know, just for a second,
I thought it really was going to be for me.
But it wasrt.
I spent hours with me nose pressed up against the window, till someone heard me calling and unfroze me.
Yes, I would've killed for that horse.
But you know what?
I still hung up my stocking on Hogswatch Eve.
And do you know why?
Cos I had hope!
Yeah.
And the next morning, our dad had put in my stocking a little wooden horse that he had carved his very own self.
Ah, and that was won'th more than all the expensive toy horses in the world?
No, cos you're a selfish little bugger when you're only seven.
It's only grown-ups that think like that.
This is wrong.
It is... unfair.
Well, that's life, innit, master, eh?
But I'm not.
This is supposed to be the season to be jolly.
- Hmm.
- And other things ending in "olly".
Please.
Just take her out of vocal range.
Mr Brown.
Your big moment.
Break me out the real Tooth Fairy.
Oh, come along, lad.
If you're the Lecturer in Recent Runes, can't you do something more, well, magical?
Well, Spold's Unstirring Divisor would do it.
You would end up with a large beaker filled with all the nastiness.
It's not difficult at all, if you don't mind the side effects.
Tell me about the side effects.
Well, the main one is that the rest of him would end up in a somewhat larger beaker.
- Alive?
- Well, broadly, yes.
Living tissue, certainly.
And definitely sober.
Why don't we just mix up absolutely everything and see what happens?
It's got to be won'th a try.
Ah.
Thank you, my dear.
A-ha!
Will this take much longer?
We may not have much time.
Oh, you can't be too careful.
- What's that?
- Ssh.
Wow-Wow sauce.
The hottest sauce in the universe.
And it'll blow your head clean off.
It's not safe to drink if the sweat is still condensing on the bottle.
On the other hand, If it is a kill-or-cure remedy, then, we are, given the possibility that the patient is immortal probably onto a winner.
I wonder if it's gone critical yet.
I don't know.
I wish you fellas would show some backbone.
Careful, Archchancellor!
What you have there may represent pure sobriety.
I'll try it.
You did say he was immortal, didn't you?
- And you mean... he just appeared?
- Yes!
He has no memory of existing before appearing at the Hogfather's castle.
You mean, like this fellow?
Don't be ridiculous.
Gods and gnomes don't appear en masse for no reason.
Bring me, let's see, 20 pints of lager, some pepper vodka and bottle of coffee liqueur.
I didn't have you sobered up just so you could go on a binge.
- You don't drink.
- I don't?
Oh.
Yeah.
- I need you to help me.
- Oh.
I'm afraid I did it, didn't I?
I, erm, I said something to young Stibbons about drinking and hangovers, didn't I?
You mean you created it just like that?
Oh, I find that very hard to believe, Mustrum.
Good job nobody mentioned the Hair Loss Fairy, then!
I am not losing my hair.
It is just very finely spaced.
Yes, half on your head and half on your hairbrush.
For the last time, I am not...
I wish I knew where that was coming from.
We need a bigger brain for this.
That thinking engine of yours working, Ponder?
Er, Hex is resting, Archchancellor.
Can you hear me in there?
You don't have to shout, Archchancellor.
What is that "ning-ning, ning-ning, ning-ning" noise all about?
It says, "Look at the Dean. "
"Look at the...
Dean. "
Is there a problem?
- Are you the Hair Loss Fairy?
- Apparently.
What have you been doing with my hair?
Just a minute.
Where exactly were you before I found you in the snow?
Anywhere where drink had been consumed in beastly quantities
- sometime previously, you could say.
- A-ha.
- You were an imminent vital force?
- Oh, sounds great!
What is that?
So, when we joked about the Hair Loss Fairy, it suddenly focused on the Dears head.
You're calling things into being.
I personally have always wondered if there was an Eater of Socks.
You know how there's always one missing?
Ah!
To the laundry!
Tell me again who these people are.
Some of the cleverest men in the world.
And I'm sober, am I?
What is that ridiculous thing on your head?
I don't know, sir!
What?
What is it?
It says here...
"If found, please return to the Tooth Fairy's castle. "
Well, thank goodness the Tooth Fairy already exists, hey?
Tooth Fairy?
Oh, you see her around a lot these days.
Or them, rather.
It's a sort of franchise operation to collect childrers teeth in exchange for money.
And she has a castle.
She sounds great.
Actually, I do remember one thing.
When I appeared at the Hogfather's house, there was this drunken little fellow in a pointy hat.
I thought it was just the drink talking, but he did mention something about the permanent end of perpetual servitude for the little helpers of all fantasy personifications!
Including the Tooth Fairy.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
Where did you find this?
Is he alright?
I say, what is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's castle?
- Now I'm feeling normal, can I come?
- This is not a normal situation.
Look, I think I'd better tell you.
- My grandfather is Death.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Death.
You know, death.
The robes, the scythe, the white horse, bones.
Death.
But at the moment, he's acting rather strange.
I want to make sure I've got this clear.
You think your grandfather is Death and you think he's acting strange?
Look, Death adopted my mother.
He then took on a human apprentice.
They fell in love and I'm the result.
This is fascinating.
Let's say I picked up a few strange genetic knacks along the way.
- Now, that looks dangerous.
- I hope so.
- Wait!
I could help you!
- Would you be any good in a fight?
Er, yes.
I could be sick on people.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Whoa!
- There he is!
Watch yourselves!
- We have to sort this out.
We can't have creatures popping into existence just because people are talking about them.
Unygienic.
So, what is this implied creation, then?
"Humans have always ascribed random, seasonal, natural or inexplicable actions to human-shaped entities. "
"Such examples are the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy and Death. "
Well, that's all very well, but I'm damn sure there's never been an Eater of Socks or an Oh God of Hangovers.
I think it works like this.
What we're getting is the personification of forces,
- just like Hex said.
- A bit like the Hogfather?
I mean, when you're a kiddie, it's as good an explanation as any as where presents come from.
But why is it happening now?
"Beliefs causing new creatures to appear. "
You could put it like that.
"There's a finite quantity of belief in the universe. "
Well, certainly people can only believe in so many things.
"It follows that if a major focus of belief is removed, there will be spare belief. "
Alright, then.
Well, I just don't...
What are people not believing in all of a sudden, then?
"Out of cheese error. "
"Melon.
Melon.
Melon. "
"Redo from start. "
It's Hogswatch.
I suppose the Hogfather is around, isn't he?
I like this job.
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
Excuse me.
Yes.
This will show them.
But Poor Little Match Girl dying in the snow is all part of the spirit of Hogswatch, master.
You see, people hear about it and they say,
"We might be as poor as a disabled banana and only can afford to eat mud and boots, but see how much better off we are than the Poor Little Match Girl!"
That makes them happy and grateful for what they have got.
I know what the spirit of Hogswatch is, Albert.
You're not allowed to do that.
The Hogfather can.
The Hogfather gives presents.
There's no better present than the future.
That's it.
I've had enough of this pixie lark.
I'm waiting for the Hogfather.
I'm in the dark, waiting for the Hogfather.
Me.
A believer in natural philosophy.
I can find the square root of 27.4 in my head.
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's not as if I've hung a stocking up.
There'd be some point if...
Take her somewhere warm and give her a good dinner.
And I may well be checking up later.
Looks like we've been chosen to do a bit of charity.
Well, I don't call it very charitable, just dumping someone on people like this.
I dunno.
Some people wouldn't know the real meaning of Hogswatch if it jumped up and clocked 'em in the gob.
No!
This is a child's painting.
Twyla paints like that.
I painted like that.
Grandfather saved some of my draw...
Come on.
Let's find the house.
- What house?
- There's always a house.
I was told you were the best locksmith in the city.
Locks don't generally alter themselves while you're working on them, that's what I'm saying.
Are you the best or not?
No!
Not the dark!
Banjo.
I'm getting out of here.
There's something wrong with this place.
I made a big pile.
Do you want to come with me?
It's pretty here.
Mr Sideney.
Would he deliver to apes earlier than to humans?
Interesting point, sir.
Possibly you're referring to my theory that humans may have descended from apes.
A bold hypothesis, which, if the Grants Committee could just see their way clear to letting me hire a boat and sail around to the islands...
I just thought he might deliver alphabetically.
Let me see, now.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Hogfather, of course.
Erm... ho, ho, ho.
You look extremely thin in the face.
I...
I'm, er...
I'm a bit ill.
Oh.
Terminally, I would say.
A- ha!
It's a false beard.
- No, it's not.
- It's got hooks for the ears.
That must've given you a spot of trouble there.
It's a pillow!
I thought there were seven locks.
Yeah, but they're half magic, half real and half not there.
There's parts of 'em don't exist half the time.
I thought you could open any lock anyone ever made.
Made by humans and most dwarves.
I don't know what made these.
You never said anything about magic...
That's a shame.
Then, really, I have no more need of your services.
- You may as well go back home.
- What about my money?
Of course.
You should get what you deserve.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr Tea Cup.
I'm leaving with what's coming to me and you ain't stopping me.
Banjo certainly ain't.
I knew his old ma in the good old days.
You think you're nasty?
You think you're mean?
Ma Lilywhite'd tear your ears off and spit 'em in your eyes.
Cocky little devil.
I remember you when you was little, Banjo.
- I used to sit you on my knees.
- Banjo...
There you are.
Where's all these shadows coming from?
It's giving me the creeps!
It's all your fault.
Oh, yeah?
So it wasrt you who said, "Wow. $10,000.
Count me in!"
But I didn't know there'd be all this creepy stuff!
I wanna go home.
It's like dealing with a child!
Poor guy must have slipped.
Yeah.
Slipped.
That's the Tooth Fairy's castle?
- It's teeth.
- And I should be scared?
There's nothing that scary about teeth.
Did I say I was scared?
I must just be hungover again.
- Oh, no.
- They're only teeth.
Oi!
- Surely no one would try to...
- What is that?
It's such old magic, it isn't even magic any more.
If you've got a piece of someone's hair, nail clipping or tooth, you can control them.
Don't tell me someone's...
- What's that shadow?
- This place is alive.
And it's protecting itself.
So, what happened to the other fellow?
Well the Hogfather has enemies.
What did he do, miss a chimney?
There's, er, there's people down there, Mr Teatime.
Well, just do away with them.
Well, er, one of them's a girl.
Then, do away with them... politely.
Keep going.
Quicker.
It's after me!
Let me out!
- What was that?
- It's finding their nightmares.
Let me out!
It's after me!
Pull yourself together.
Look around.
There's nothing chasing you.
I thought it was the... wardrobe.
What wardrobe?
When I was a kid, we had this big... wardrobe.
And it had this... this...
On the door, it had this face!
And at night, it whispered things.
Who's that moving up there?
I think they saw us.
And if they're tooth fairies, there's been a really stupid equal-opportunities policy.
Right.
You go that way, I'll go this way.
- Why don't we stay together?
- What's got into you?
Hmm?
This is a childrers place.
The rules are what children believe.
- Well, that's a relief.
- You think so?
It's impossible to die here.
My grandfather doesn't figure in a child's world.
That man who fell down the stairs looked pretty dead.
Oh, you die.
But not here.
You...
Let's see.
Yes.
You go somewhere else.
Away.
- Arert you Susan?
- Yes.
When you came for Twyla's last tooth, you were shocked I could see you.
- Oh, yes, and I saw...
- We may not have a lot of time.
Is this... the Tooth Fairy?
A tooth fairy.
Do you... drink at all?
No, I don't.
Not touch alcohol at all?
Never.
My dad's very strict about that sort of thing.
Nice castle.
Can we get on?
Good.
Who brought you here, Violet?
I don't know.
But he's dressed like an assassin.
OK.
You two stay here.
I'll go find him.
And I'll look after Violet.
That's the fourth lock open.
I commend your expertise.
And the others?
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?
Logically, if you're the guardian of childrers beliefs and this is your castle and I come across as securely locked a door as this then, not to thoroughly investigate would lack elegance.
What's that sound?
- What sound?
- That sound.
Like old scissors scraping.
Have you ever heard of the Auditors?
Well, I suppose that the Bursar might have done.
Not auditors of money.
Auditors of reality.
They are the civil service of everything.
And they want to get rid of us?
They want humans to be...
less creative.
The Hogfather is a symbol of this.
Strange thinking.
They hate the way humans make up stories about the universe.
I can't think why.
And you, why are you doing this job?
Someone must.
It is vitally important.
Before dawn, there must be enough belief in the Hogfather.
- Why?
- So that the sun will come up.
I seldom joke.
What sort of godding do you do?
Oh, I'm the, er, I'm the Oh God of Hangovers.
- A god of hangovers?
Oh, how awful.
- I suppose so.
You're more cut out to be one of those important gods.
- Oh!
- What's this, eh?
Lovers' Lane?
You leave him alone, you!
He's a god!
A god?
Dear me!
Out of thunderbolts, are we?
Well, you know, I've never killed a g...
What's the matter?
It's just a wardrobe, innit?
I don't want to see!
I don't want to see.
Hex was right, Archchancellor.
Hex?
Who is Hex?
Erm, he's the biggest thinker in the world.
I would like to meet this Mr Hex.
Quite a large thaumic reading, gentlemen.
I think he got here by magic.
Where did he go?
They say you are the biggest thinker in the world, but do you also believe?
Extend logically the result of the human race ceasing to believe in the Hogfather.
Will the sun come up?
Answer.
Correct.
How may this be prevented?
Answer.
"Regular and consistent belief. "
Good.
I have a task for you, thinking engine.
Believe in the Hogfather.
Do you believe?
Answer.
Do you believe?
Answer!
Good.
Hmm.
Oh, no!
Let me see.
How old are you?
And have you been naughty or nice?
Hello.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
Bone handle.
Rather tasteless skull-and-bone decoration.
Death himself's second-favourite weapon.
Am I right?
Oh, my.
It must be Hogswatch.
This must mean that you are Susan.
The famous granddaughter.
Nobility.
I'd bow, but I'm afraid you'd do something dreadful.
Yes!
Yes!
Left-handed using a wooden pick.
It's so simple!
Ah!
Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh, I've managed to open the fifth lock.
No problem.
They're just based on Woddeley's Occult Sequence.
- How do you know who I am?
- Easy.
Twurp's Peerage.
Family motto, non timetis messor.
Your father was well known.
Went a long way very fast.
As for your grandfather, honestly, that motto, "fear not the reaper", is that good taste?
Course, you don't need to fear him, do you?
Or do you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who are you, anyway?
I beg your pardon.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Jonathan Teh-ah-tim-eh at your service.
You mean...
like around four o'clock in the afternoon?
No.
I did say...
Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Please don't try to break my concentration by annoying me.
- How are you getting on, Mr Sideney?
- Oh!
Er...
According to Woddeley's Sequence, number six should be copper and blue-green light.
You think your grandfather will try to rescue you?
But now I have his sword.
You see, I wonder...
All fingers and thumbs, Mr Sideney.
Er, I've managed to open the sixth lock, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Really?
But it may not be all-important now.
Thank you, anyway.
You've been most helpful.
- Erm...
- Yes.
You may go.
Is that all you're here for?
A robbery, like a petty thief?
A thief?
Me?
I'm not a thief, madam.
No.
These gentlemen are thieves.
That's Medium Dave.
And Exhibit B is Banjo.
He can talk.
Who are you?
I'm incognito.
You look like a wizard to me.
Did you suck your thumb when you were little?
Nope!
- Is that the Scissor Man?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Kids believe all kinds of crap, but I'm a grown-up now, so...
No more Hogfather.
And that's only the start.
I'll be able to make people believe anything I want.
What's this?
You said, "No more Hogfather. "
He does know what we've been doing here, doesn't he?
You did tell him?
There's gotta be a Hogfather.
There's always a Hogfather.
- She did it!
She killed him.
- No, I didn't.
He...
- Did!
- Didrt.
- Did.
- What's this about the Hogfather?
I don't think he's dead, but Teatime has made him very ill.
Who cares?
When this is over, Banjo, you'll have as many presents as you want.
Trust me.
There has to be a Hogfather, else there's no Hogswatch.
- It's just another solar festival.
- Banjo and me are going.
Banjo, you're coming with me right now.
Grab her, Banjo.
It's all her fault.
Our mam said no hitting girls.
No touching them or pulling them hair.
She's not a girl.
She's a freak.
I think I know you, Teatime.
You're the mad kid they're all scared of, right?
- Banjo, I said grab her.
- Our mam said...
The kid who didn't know the difference between chucking a stone at a cat and setting it on fire.
I said shut up.
Get her, Banjo.
The kind of little boy who looks up dolls' dresses.
- I didn't.
- Our mam said...
Ah, to blazes with your mam!
What did you say about our mam?
I bet no one wanted to play with you.
- Not the kid with no friends.
- Banjo, you do as I tell you.
Our mam...
Our mam...
Our mam said...
Have you been a bad boy, Banjo?
You been letting him get into trouble again, our Davey?
You have, haven't you?
No, Mam.
No, Mam.
No, Mam!
You need a good hiding, Banjo.
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, Mam!
You been playing with girls again?
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, Mam!
Sorry, Mam!
Sorry!
No, Mam.
No, Mam.
No, Mam!
No!
Oh, no.
I don't think so.
This place gets into your head, doesn't it?
Lt... finds out how to deal with you.
But I'm in touch with my inner child.
It's so much fun.
No pulling girls' hair.
That's bad.
I'm gonna have so much fun with this.
So light.
You dare!
My grandfather will come after you.
- He comes after everyone.
- He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
It doesn't work here.
There's no death here.
Hi, inner child.
I'm the inner baby-sitter.
Happy Hogswatch!
Is he dead?
He's not breathing.
Breathing spell.
Breathing spell.
Spolt's forthright respirator, perhaps.
I think I've got it written down somewhere.
Come on, chaps.
Give me some space.
Excuse me... excuse me, but this is vitally important for the advancement of natural philosophy.
Did you see any bright lights?
A shining tunnel?
What is all this, Mr Stibbons?
Put the damn quill away.
This must be the Unseen University.
And you're all... wizards.
There was a sword.
Oh, yes.
It's, er, fallen on the floor.
Did I do that?
I really must be off.
Well, he won't get far.
The main doors are locked, in accordance with Archchancellor Spold's rules.
- Wort get far?
- No!
While holding a sword which appears to be able to cut through anything?
You can get into trouble, hitting girls.
No playing with girls.
What am I gonna do now?
Hello, my dear.
No.
Sorry, dear?
You're not the Tooth Fairy.
Oh, I am, dear.
Oh, Grandma, what big teeth you have.
You've even got a shawl.
Oh, dear.
I don't understand, lovey.
You forgot the rocking chair.
I always thought there'd be a rocking chair.
I don't think you're real.
It's not a little old woman in a shawl running this place.
You're out of my head.
That's how you defend yourself.
You poke around in people's heads and find the things that work...
No.
It's horrible, but it doesn't frighten me.
I like spiders.
Dogs?
No.
I like rats.
Rats are fine.
Sorry, is anyone frightened of that?
I...
I...
You're a bogeyman, aren't you?
Not a.
The!
The first bogeyman.
- You look terrible.
- Thank you very much.
I mean ill.
I used to jump out on them and say, "Boo!" Yeah.
But then I got to like 'em.
Only children were frightened of me.
I mean, what's to be scared of?
Horns, bony arms.
But then I discovered that there were much worse things than me and I wanted to protect the children, keep them safe from all the really bad things.
So I built all this to be a safe place.
And the teeth?
If you leave all those teeth around,
- anything could happen.
- Anything nearly did.
So, you are the Tooth Fairy, then?
Yes!
I...
Oh...
Then they came, stealing.
I'm too weak to look after them any more.
You don't die here.
You just get old.
Listening to the laughter.
Don't worry about the teeth.
I'll make them safe again.
I think it would be a good idea if you did the Tooth Fairy's job, Banjo.
Do...
Do you think that'd be alright?
Wort the Tooth Fairy mind?
You...
Do it until she comes back.
So, er, who's gonna tell me what to do?
No one's ever going to tell you what to do again, Banjo.
Thanks, miss.
I'll keep the teeth safe.
- Er, miss...?
- Yes, Banjo?
Can I have a puppy?
I had a kitten, but our mam drownded it cos it was dirty.
I think it'll turn up quite soon, Banjo.
Thanks, miss.
Billy!
Violet's talked about it.
We thought we ought to come back and help.
- It's OK.
They're all gone.
- Oh.
And Banjo needed a new job.
That's funny.
So does Billy.
Look, why don't you two make yourselves useful and help Banjo clear up this mess?
He's pretty much running the place now.
- Oh, but he's...
- He's in charge.
We'd love to help, Banjo.
Together.
Good.
Have fun.
Now I'm going home.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
Grandfather!
What are you doing here?
It is not over.
You must bring the Hogfather home.
These look like the mountains where the Castle of Bones was.
They are.
- It's a pig!
- A boar.
This boar is the...?
Yes.
The Hogfather as he began.
- And the dogs.
- These are not real dogs.
If they catch him, he won't just die.
He will... never be.
Well, stop them.
This is a human thing.
The Auditors are desperate now.
They're determined to destroy the Hogfather at whatever cost.
You must save him.
Come on.
Jump.
Just you try it.
Yes!
Who wants some?
Anyone else?
Ho, ho, ho.
You couldn't resist it in the end.
A mistake, I fancy.
It gets under your skin, life.
Speaking metaphorically, of course.
And, you see, the more you struggle for every moment, the more alive you stay.
Which is where I come in, as a matter of fact.
You can't do this.
There are rules.
Yes, there are rules.
But you broke them.
How dare you.
How dare you!
And now there remains only one final question.
Have you been naughty or nice?
Ho, ho, ho.
We saved you.
Dying's not how it's supposed to go!
Er...
Er, sorry.
Hyah!
Well that about wraps it up for this dress.
I'd just like to ask, purely out of academic interest, you were sure I was going to survive, were you?
I was quite confident.
Good.
Now, tell me...
What would've happened if you hadrt saved him?
- Yes.
- The sun would not have risen.
Then what would've happened?
A mere ball of flaming gas would have illuminated the world.
Alright, I'm not stupid.
You're saying that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.
No.
Humans need fantasy to be human.
To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.
With tooth fairies, Hogfathers...
Yes.
As practice, you have to start out learning to believe the little lies.
- So we can believe the big ones?
- Yes.
Justice, mercy, duty, that sort of thing.
- But they're not the same at all.
- You think so?
Then, take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve, and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy.
And yet, you try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world, as if there is some...
some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.
But people have got to believe that, or what's the point?
You need to believe in things that aren't true.
How else can they become?
Er, would you like to visit for Hogswatch dinner?
Albert is frying a pudding.
I, er...
Well, they're really expecting me here.
Would you like a drink before you go?
A cup of cocoa would be appropriate in the circumstances.
Right.
There are biscuits in the tin on the mantelpiece.
- Susars got a poker, you know.
- My goodness me.
I thought all of you knew that by now.
Indeed.
Last week, she picked a bogey up by its nose.
I'll give Gawain his stocking, then I'll come and watch.
Susan...
Well, well.
Now, this is... unexpected.
A family affair.
I wonder...
Is it possible to kill... death?
Hmm!
This must be a very special sword.
And it certainly works here.
And, of course, it might well not be regarded as murder.
Possibly it is... a civic act.
It would be, as they say the big one.
You may have some personal knowledge about your vulnerability, but I'm pretty certain that Susan here will quite definitely die.
So I'd rather you didn't try any last-minute stuff.
I am last-minute stuff.
I don't remember them asking for anything that made a noise.
Oh, there has to be something in the stocking that makes a noise.
Otherwise, what is 4:30am for?
There are children?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
- Call them.
- Certainly not.
It'll be instructive.
Educational.
And when your adversary is Death, you can't help but be the good guy.
Call them.
Gawain.
Twyla.
Come in.
Come in!
Curly haired tots!
I've caught this bogeyman.
What shall we do with him, huh?
It's only a skeleton!
Yes.
A nasty, creepy, horrible skeleton.
Scary, huh?
He's eating a biscuit.
A creepy, bony man in a black robe.
You're fidgeting with that kettle, so I expect you're thinking of doing something creative.
Put it down.
Please.
- Slowly.
- Huh!
That's not very creepy.
It's just bones.
It's just standing there.
It's not even making "whoo-whoo" noises.
And, anyway, you're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Really?
Well, let's see how creepy I can be.
Oh, no!
Couldrt have gone through you.
There's so many ribs... and things.
It only kills monsters.
Stop time now.
You winked at me.
I thought you had a plan.
Indeed.
Oh, yes.
- I planned to see what you would do.
- What?
I did add the sparkly stars and the noise, though.
I thought they would be appropriate.
And if I hadrt done anything?
I dare say I would have thought of something
- at the last minute.
- That was the last minute.
There is always time for another last minute.
Stop playing dead, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.
You got it right.
Of course.
I'll take care of the body.
That will prevent inconvenient questions.
Erm, you did know the poker would go through me?
I was quite confident.
Ah.
I have made this for you.
Oh!
Thank you.
What is it?
Albert said there ought to be snow on it, but it appears to have melted.
It is, of course, a Hogswatch card.
Oh.
There should have been a robin on it as well, but I had considerable difficulty in getting it to stay on.
Ah.
- It was not at all cooperative.
- Really?
It did not seem to get into the Hogswatch spirit at all.
Oh.
Thank you.
- Granddad...?
- Yes?
Why?
I mean, why did you do all this?
Human beings make life so interesting.
Do you know that in a universe so full of wonders, they have managed to invent boredom?
- Quite astonishing.
- Oh.
Well, then, er...
Happy Hogswatch.
Yes.
Granddad.
Happy Hogswatch.
Happy Hogswatch and good night, children, everywhere.
Ooh!
Hello!
Hello!
Oh, you're cute.
Yeah, come on.
Come on, let's play.
Yeah.
You have a big, wooden rocking horse in the window.
Er... yes.
That's a special order I made for...
Lord Rodney.
How much would this lordship have paid you?
- $12.
- I will give you 50.
Would you like me to wrap it, sir?
No.
I will take it as it is.
Thank you.
Incidentally, there is a small boy out there with his nose frozen to the window.
Some warm water should do the trick.
Happy Hogswatch, sir.
Everything starts somewhere although many physicists disagree.
There is the the constant desire to find out where.
Where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that, the Discworld was formed drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle, the great A'Tuin.
It was some time after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories of the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis.
"Things just happen.
What the hell?"
And so our story begins in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld, a city where magic is just another job, and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for Wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets.
Our story begins on a midwinter festival bearing a remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
(oinking)
And so it was...
the night before Hogswatch.
"And then Jack chopped down what was the world's last beanstalk, adding murder and ecological terrorism to the theft, enticement and trespass charges already mentioned, and all the giant's children didn't have a daddy any more."
"But he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge, which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you are a hero, because no one asks inconvenient questions."
And now, it's time for bed.
- Susan?
- Yes?
You know last week when we wrote a letter to the Hogfather?
- Yes?
- Well, will he really come?
And when's he coming here?
Does it matter, if you get the presents anyway?
Yes.
Well, if you don't believe in the Hogfather,
- there won't be any presents.
- Thought so.
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly fat man is about to deliver their presents not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit, especially in a city where there is a guild
for everything.
(clock chimes)
(faint noise)
The doors are locked.
The windows are barred.
The dog does not appear to have woken up.
The squeaky floorboards haven't.
I really doubt that you are a ghost, and gods generally do not announce themselves so politely.
You could, of course, be Death, but I don't believe he bothers with such niceties.
Besides, I'm feeling quite well.
Hmm...
Good evening.
(eerie voice) Good evening, Lord Downey.
You appear to be a spectre.
Our nature is not a matter for discussion.
We offer you a commission.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
- Our scale of fees...
- The payment will be $3 million.
- No questions asked, I assume.
- No questions answered.
But does the suggested fee represent the difficulty involved?
The client is heavily guarded?
Not guarded at all, but almost certainly impossible to delete with conventional weapons.
We like to know for whom we are working.
We are sure you do.
We need to know your name, or names, in strict client confidentiality, of course.
You may think of us as...
the Auditors.
Really?
What do you audit?
Everything.
We maintain the logical order of the universe.
I think we need to know a little more than that.
We are the people with $3 million.
We need to know where, when, and, of course, who.
The location is not on any map and we need the task to be completed by sunrise tomorrow.
This is essential.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
(Downey) But won't he be out on his rounds?
Ho, ho, ho!
(chuckles)
(echoing in chimney) Ho, ho, ho!
Is this a joke?
We have no sense of humour.
There are some that say that this... person does not exist.
He must exist!
How else could you so readily recognise his picture?
And many are in correspondence with him.
He would be difficult to find.
You will find persons on any street who can tell you his approximate address.
Yes, of course, but as you say, they can hardly give a map reference.
Even then, how would the...
Fat Man be inhumed?
A glass of poisoned sherry, perhaps?
You misunderstand the nature of employment.
How do I misunderstand you exactly?
We pay, you find the ways and means.
- How can I contact you?
- We will contact you.
We know where you are.
We know... where everyone is.
- Winvoe?
- Yes, sir?
Is Mr Teatime still in the building?
(oinking)
- Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
- (cracks whip)
Up, Tusker.
Up, Snouter!
Giddy up!
(laughs)
(assistant) Wahey!
(tapping at window)
Go away.
I don't do that stuff any more.
(louder tapping)
(flapping / creaking)
Yes, Twyla?
I'm afraid of the monster in the cellar, Susan.
- It's going to eat me up.
- What, again?
Ye gods, there's a girl out here with a poker!
What are you doing?
Twyla's afraid of the monster in the cellar, Mrs Gaiter.
And you're going to attack it with a poker, eh?
Yes.
- Susan's our governess.
- She beats up monsters with a poker?
Actually, that's a very clever idea.
My daughter gets it into her head there's a monster in the cellar, you go in with a poker and make bashing noises while the child listens,
- and everything's alright.
- Is that what you're doing, Susan?
Yes, Mrs Gaiter.
This I've got to watch.
It's not every day you see monsters beaten up by a girl.
(all laugh)
Come on.
- (knock at door)
- Come in, Mr Teatime.
Carter, just put it on the table over there, will you?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll go and fetch another cup directly, sir.
- What?
- For your visitor, sir.
What visitor?
Oh, for when Mr Tea...
Mr Teatime?
It's pronounced...
Teh-ah-tim-eh, sir.
Everyone gets it wrong, sir.
How did you get in here?
Easily.
I got mildly... scorched on the last few feet, of course.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with... animals, sir.
I have a report here that says that you nailed Sir George's dog to the ceiling.
I couldn't have it barking while I was working, sir.
- Some people would have drugged it.
- Oh.
But I definitely fulfilled the contract.
I checked Sir George's breathing with a mirror, as instructed.
Apparently his head was several feet from his body at that point.
That was alright, wasn't it, sir?
It, erm lacked elegance.
I thank you, sir!
I'm always happy to be corrected.
I shall remember that... next time.
It was about the next time that I wished to talk.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
(thudding / crashing)
(clattering)
You don't have to worry.
She always wins.
(approaching footsteps)
Hah!
Very well done.
Very p-sychological.
Clever idea, that, bending the poker.
I expect you're not afraid any more, eh, my girl?
No.
No.
Very p-sychological.
Susan says, "Don't get afraid.
Get angry."
Oh, well, er, thank you, Susan.
And now, if you'd all like to come back into the parlour...
I mean, the drawing room...
Dashed convincing, the way she bent the poker like that!
- Have they all gone, Twyla?
- Yes, Susan.
Good.
(monster moans)
(monster sobs)
(monster) Mind the tail!
(monster groans)
That's what we do to monsters.
Now it's back to bed for you, my girl.
Difficult, sir.
Certainly.
But I have devoted some... time to it, sir.
You mean you've actually sat down and thought out how to inhume the Hogfather?
Why, yes, sir.
And the Soul Cake Duck.
And Death, sir.
They're imaginary creatures.
Makes it a challenge.
I suppose I just see things differently from other people.
We may be able to see the complaint of Sir George's estate against you with regard to his dog rather differently, and approve your graduation to full membership of the Guild.
Take the dark, sir?
Wear black, sir?
If you agree to undertake...
this contract.
With due elegance, of course.
With elegance guaranteed, sir.
Er, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?
You have... actually applied yourself to a study of ways of killing Death?
Only as a hobby, sir.
But then some people might say that he is technically immortal.
Everyone has their weak points, sir.
(chatter)
It's gone six.
He's not coming.
- Let's go.
- Sit down, will you?
Assassins are always fashionably late, because of style, right?
What's this?
You never said anything about him being an assassin.
It's Teatime.
He's paying top rate.
We can wait for top rate.
Teatime?
I've heard he's... mental.
And he's got a funny eye.
What I don't understand is...
how long has this place had waiters?
Good evening.
Do have another drink while we wait for the other members of our little... troop.
(door creaks)
Susan, there's a monster under my bed again.
(sighs)
(spooky growling)
(protesting snarls)
Oh!
Ow!
Ow!
That's a wizard.
No, I'm not.
I'm incognito.
Yeah, right.
You're just someone in a pointy hat.
Mr Sideney here is indeed a wizard.
A student, anyway.
This is my brother Banjo.
This is Chickenwire.
I didn't want to come!
Mr Sideney's down on his luck at the moment.
Hence his willingness to join our little venture.
So what's the job?
We don't do jobs.
We perform services.
And the service will earn each of you $10,000.
No one said anything about there being magic in this.
Well, I...
Do the voice on it!
- Do the voice on it!
- No!
- Not the voice!
- Hit it on the head with a poker.
- Not the poker!
- This is the friendly warning.
Understand?
Because it's Hogswatch.
What are you, a witch or something?
I'm just... something.
Now, you won't be around here again, will you?
Or we'll put your head under the blanket.
It's got fluffy bunnies on it.
Fluffy bunnies...
No!
Go away and stop bothering me.
(monster growls)
That wasn't as much fun as the one last month, the one when you kicked him in the trousers.
Just go to sleep now.
- Locks.
- We have a locksmith.
- Who?
- Mr Brown.
And you can help me carry this.
It's rather heavy.
What is this?
This is my brother Banjo.
Does it do tricks?
No.
He can lift two men up in each hand, by their necks.
Yeah.
(high-pitched giggle)
He looks like a volcano.
Really?
Wanna be fashionably late, do you?
I do so hope we're gonna be friends, Mr Medium Dave.
It really hurts to think I might not be among... friends.
And I suppose we might as well make a start.
(snores)
Hello!
My name's Violet, and I have been your tooth fairy for this evening.
(muffled scream)
(gasps in fright) Here, there ain't nothing valuable, you know.
Nothing valuable, only a few bags of t-t-t-t...
Teeth?
I know.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
What's your name, sir?
- Ernie.
Yes, Ernie.
- (giggles)
Come along, gentlemen.
- This is my friend Ernie.
- (muffled screams)
He's gonna be our driver for tonight.
Put her in the back, Banjo.
Mister, I ain't rightly allowed to carry passengers.
Charlie'd give me a right telling off.
Oh, don't you worry about that.
We're all friends here.
(Banjo) Our mam said no hitting girls.
Only bad boys do that, our mam said.
- Shut it!
- (muffled screams)
Ssh!
Ernie here doesn't want to listen to our troubles.
Wh-Wh-Where to, mister?
You know the way, Ernie.
Behind the Unseen University.
Where the students of magic are still hard at work on the night before Hogswatch.
It's just a shame we don't have any radiation shielding.
You want radiation shielding, Mr Stibbons?
Advice from Hex, Bursar.
As the university won't supply us students with a thaumic particle accelerator, we've started to build our own.
Safety first and all that!
(machine speeds up)
(explosion)
(pants) Dean, have you seen the Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic?
I need some urgent advice!
Ask the Chair of Indefinite Studies.
- Er...
Hmm...
- Lecturer in Recent Runes?
- Well, you see, it all depends...
- (explosion)
(all groan)
(coughs)
I don't know...
In my day, when I was an undergraduate,
I wouldn't have been studying on Hogswatch Night.
It's just not natural.
I'd have been sick twice by now.
(coughing)
Bursar?
- Bursar?
- Hello, Mustrum.
- Dean?
Oh, there you are.
- Archchancellor?
Members of the faculty, I've decided, as a Hogswatch present to myself, to open up the late Archchancellor Weatherwax's old bathroom.
(chuckles) So I don't have to sluice down with you fellas.
It's unhygienic.
You can catch stuff.
(Ernie) 'Ere, I can't take you lot through the wall!
(Teatime) Listen, Ernie.
Ern.
You will take us through, or, and I say this with very considerable regret,
I'll have to kill you.
- If I take you through the wall...
- What's the worst that can happen?
You'll lose your job.
Whereas if you don't, you'll die.
Really, Mustrum, I think this is most unwise.
It said in the plans there was a bathroom.
You chaps are all acting as if it was some kind of torture chamber.
A bathroom designed by Bloody Stupid Johnson!
The late Bergholt Stuttley Johnson was the worst inventor in the world, Archchancellor!
Yes!
Well, not everything he made had a horribly fateful flaw.
That thing they use in the kitchen for peeling potatoes, for example.
The thing with the brass plate saying "improved manicure device"?
Well, it's only water.
Even old Johnson can't do much harm with water.
(all mutter apprehensively)
Go to it, lad.
- So?
- Er...
Well, he just chucks it at the wall there
- and it goes "twing".
- Really?
May I try?
Oh!
Ain't that nice, our Davey?
Yeah.
And then you just drive forward.
Right.
Quick, mind, cos it only stays open for a little while.
Thank you very much, Ernie, very much indeed.
(grunts)
Wasn't he dull?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
The Tooth Fairy?
Another childish belief.
- Exactly.
- Very elegant.
- It is.
- You have to start somewhere.
Once you have their little minds in your grip, it's goodbye, Hogfather.
It's him!
- Could I give you a hand?
- Oh, yeah!
Oh!
Here, your fingers aren't half cold, mister.
Sorry.
What did he want to go and do that for, eh?
I did what he said!
He could've killed me.
Yes.
I always keep a nip on me these cold nights.
- Keeps me spirits up.
- Indeed.
How am I gonna explain all this, then, eh?
Sorry?
That was very rude of me.
I wasn't paying attention.
What am I gonna tell people?
Letting some blokes ride off in me cart, neat as you like...
That's gonna be the sack for sure.
There, at least, I have some good news, Ernest.
And then again, I also have some bad news.
So...
I'm dead, then.
Correct.
(moans)
Now, tell me about these blokes who stole your cart and killed you.
Honestly!
Death gets worse and worse.
He seems to like humans.
So illogical!
But the beauty of the assassin's plan is that he can't interfere.
But Death can go everywhere.
No.
Not... quite... everywhere.
(muffled shouts)
(muffled scream)
(chokes)
(groans)
Great job, but you look a right tit wearing these helmets.
Hello.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
What's yours?
(footsteps)
Albert, something is not right.
(squawks) Too right.
(rumbling)
This is the Mythological Persons room.
How can one of them die?
Soul Cake Duck.
The Tooth Fairy.
The Hogfather!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear!
(chuckles)
Albert!
We may not have much time.
(faint, muffled cries)
(muffled cries)
(Violet) Oh, is anybody there?
(sobbing)
I don't know what you're expecting me to say, but... (muffled)
Ssh.
Questions first.
Babble...
later.
(screams)
Now, Miss Bottler,
I'd like you to think of me...
as a friend.
- How we doing, Mr Modo?
- Tanks are filled and I've stoked the boilers, Mr Archchancellor, sir.
You did read the sign on that door, Ridcully?
- (all mutter anxiously)
- You mean the sign which said,
"Do not under any circumstances open this door"?
(all mutter)
Surely it was sealed up for a reason.
Oh, he only wrote that to keep people out.
That's right.
That's what people do.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Hygiene!
That's the ticket.
I still haven't worked out where all the pipes lead.
Oh, we'll find out, don't you fear.
(squeaking)
Man the pumps, Mr Modo, all two of them, of course, in your case.
(creaking)
(chuckles in anticipation)
(all moan nervously)
She's a tooth fairy, but she's not the Tooth Fairy.
- (mutters)
- Ssh.
Teeth...
What do you expect in the Tooth Fairy's castle?
It gives me the creeps just thinking about it.
You don't have to think.
You just have to do what I said.
- All of 'em?
- Every last one.
- Put 'em in a pile.
- That's millions.
Mr Brown?
I want you to unlock every door you can find.
What's this really all about?
(mutters softly to himself)
Does he believe in things like the Soul Cake Duck?
The Sandman?
The Tooth Fairy?
Yeah.
Even the Hogfather.
Cos after we're finished here, not even he will.
(whinnying)
Onwards, Binky, to the Hogfather's Castle of Bones!
(all grunt gently)
(drunken giggling)
The first Hogswatch off in a thousand years, even if I'm going to have the mother of all hangovers in the mor...
(wails)
(hogs grunt)
How can the Hogfather bring presents to everyone at the same time?
Unless there are lots of Hogfathers.
Look, you've always believed in the Hogfather, yes?
- Yes...
- Well, if you don't believe in him,
- he won't come down the chimney.
- It's a very small chimney.
And a very small stocking, if you don't go to sleep.
(mouse squeaks)
(trap snaps)
(rustling)
(bloodcurdling scream)
(mutters)
Ah, yes.
And, erm...
"Ho, ho, ho."
(sings cheerfully)
Ooh!
(rumbling)
(continues singing)
(cackles)
(gasps)
(chuckles)
There's a tap in there marked Old Faithful... (coughs)
...which I think perhaps we might leave alone for now.
This is...
a most peculiar Hogswatch.
Any mustard?
They're a treat with mustard.
Apple sauce.
(hogs squeal)
I'm finding the beard a bit of a trial.
Well, at least it's keeping you in the right frame of mind, master.
In character, that sort of thing.
But going down the chimney...
Where's the sense in that?
It's gotta be chimbleys, innit, eh?
A bit like the beard, really.
Would these little buggers write to someone who can walk through walls if they knew?
Oh, and that reminds me.
The "ho, ho, ho" could do with some more work, if you don't mind me saying so.
Ho, ho, ho?
No, no, no!
No, you've got to put a bit more life in it, sir.
Er, no offence intended.
You've got to do a big, fat laugh, sir, you know, like... (enthusiastically) Ho, ho, ho!
Like that.
See?
You've got to sound like you're pissing brandy and you're crapping plum pudding, sir, if you'll pardon my Klatchian.
Really?
How do you know all this?
Well, I used to be young myself once, sir, surprising as it may seem.
(wind roars)
- These teeth give me the creeps.
- Just keep going!
- Why are we piling them all up?
- You don't wanna know.
The quicker the teeth are in a pile, the quicker we're out of here with our money.
No one ever laid a punch on Banjo since our mam died.
Tough but fair, your mam.
I recall that time she strangled Glossy Ron with his own leg.
Yeah.
Maybe the both of us could creep up on him and...
Yeah!
I keep thinking about that glass eye watching me.
I keep thinking it can see right in my head!
Don't worry.
He doesn't know what you're thinking.
How do you know?
You're still alive.
(faint voices from outside)
These damned eyeballs are hard, aren't they?
They're walnuts, not eyeballs.
(caws)
(caws)
I don't want you back in my life.
Understand?
- (pecks on glass)
- Don't say you haven't been warned!
Warned?
Ah!
Did you check the list?
Couldn't really make head nor tail of it, to tell you the truth.
I don't normally care if they've been naughty or nice.
(chuckles)
I can feel belief in the Hogfather fading.
- What's that?
- It looks very bad.
No, no.
It's just where something's been nibbling it.
I mean the situation.
I fear we may be too late.
Oh, well.
Never say die, master.
That's our motto.
I can't say it's ever really been mine.
(hogs squeal)
(ticking)
(ticking stops)
(heavy footsteps)
(dragging sound)
(thumping)
- (tap at window)
- You'd better watch out.
Because if the Hogfather still comes to town as result of a magical misjudgement on your part, then, you will no longer be my friend, Mr Sideney.
I... understand, sir.
Do you have a lot of friends,
Mr Sideney?
Erm... quite a few, actually.
I don't have many.
Don't seem to have the knack.
On the other hand, I don't seem to have any enemies at all.
Well it's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
That is... very... simple and will make the pile of teeth...
very... (Mr Brown) Mr Teatime!
(Sideney)... dangerous.
(Susan) Grandfather, this is Hogswatch.
It's supposed to be jolly, with mistletoe and holly... and other things...
ending in "olly".
It's a time when people are meant to feel good about things, and eat until they explode, a time when they want to see all their... relatives.
I mean, it's a time when humans are really human, and they don't want a... a skeleton at the feast, especially one, I might add, who's wearing a false beard and has got a damn cushion shoved up his robe!
I mean, why?
Albert said it would help me get into the spirit of the thing.
(Albert yelps)
This is a real job, and I was looking forward to a real Hogswatch where normal things happen with normal people in a normal house, and suddenly, the old circus comes to town.
I don't know what's going on, but you can just leave right now.
(Albert splutters)
(gibbers)
Oh!
Albert.
Buggery. (screams)
Master?
I'm stuck. (groans)
The pixie.
- (thud) - (Albert coughs)
Oh, come along in, do.
If the real Hogfather doesn't turn up soon, there's not going to be enough room for him.
- Oh... (chuckles)
- He won't be joining us.
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons,
I will add that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
The Hogfather is... unavailable.
- At Hogswatch?
- (Death) Yes.
Why?
He is...
Let me see.
There isn't an entirely appropriate human word, so, let's settle for... (whispers)
...gone.
Yes.
He is gone.
How can the Hogfather be gone?
Isn't he what you are?
Anth...
Anthropomorphic personification?
Yes.
He has become the spirit of Hogswatch.
And while he's gone, you've taken over.
That's sick.
I see the girl writes in green crayon on pink paper with a mouse in the corner.
The mouse is wearing a dress.
She decided to do that so that the Hogfather would think she was sweet, including the deliberate bad spelling.
But why are you doing...
She says she is five years old.
Seven.
In cynicism, she's about 35.
But why are you doing the...
But she believes in the Hogfather.
She'd believe in anything if there was a dolly in it for her.
But you're not going to leave without telling me... (burps)
And what are you doing here, Albert?
I thought you'd die if you ever came back to the world.
Ah, but we are not in the world.
We are in the special congruent reality created for the Hogfather.
Normal rules have to be suspended.
How else could anyone get around the entire world in one night?
That's right.
I'm one of the Hogfather's little helpers, me.
It's official.
I've got the little pointy green hat with the bell and everything.
Have you been good, have you?
(Death) Now we must be going.
Happy Hogswatch.
- (no sound)
- And, er...
Oh, yes.
(flatly) Ho, ho, ho.
(cackles) It's a nice drop of sherry, this.
You've actually been drinking the actual drink little children leave for the actual Hogfather?
Well, yeah.
Why not?
He won't be drinking any more, will he?
Eh?
(chuckles) Not where he's gone...
How many have you had, may I ask?
Hmm?
Well, I dunno.
I haven't been counting.
One million, eight hundred thousand, seven hundred and six.
And sixty-eight thousand, three hundred and nineteen pork pies.
And one turnip.
Oh, yeah.
Well... it looked pork-pie shaped.
But then, everything does after a while.
Why are you doing this?
I am sorry, I cannot tell you.
Forget you saw me.
It's not your business.
Not my business?
How can you say...
You wanted to be normal.
Good night, granddaughter.
Sleep tight.
I know I shall. (hiccups) Pardon.
(whooshing)
There are a lot of doors.
I hope this is the one.
This isn't the room we're looking for.
Just teeth in here.
Keep going, Mr Brown.
Ohh!
(screams)
Susan will try to find out what this is all about, you know.
Oh, dear.
Especially after you told her not to.
You think so?
Oh, yes.
(Death) Dear me!
I still have a lot to learn about humans, don't I?
Oh, I dunno.
Obviously it would be quite wrong to involve a human in all this.
That is why, you will recall,
I clearly forbade her to take an interest.
Yes, yes, you did.
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- That's a shame, really, because she likes to break 'em, doesn't she?
You might think I've already thought of that, but I couldn't possibly comment.
Oh.
And we have much to do.
We have the Hogfather's promises to keep.
- Right.
- (wind howls)
Has he done something to the real Hogfather?
(ticking)
(ticking stops)
Binky.
(whinnies)
Can she be eliminated?
Oh, yes.
She's mostly human.
Oh, good.
Then, can we go back to just concentrating on running the universe, making sure that gravity works and that atoms spin?
Yes, when there's not an atom of belief left in the world.
And the Hogfather is just the beginning.
What are you looking for, Mustrum?
(chuckles) My father always said, when you see a lot of people bathing together, the Verruca Gnome is running around with his little sack.
- (both chuckle)
- Modo!
Any sign of the Verruca Gnome down there, old boy?
(chuckles)
(clanging)
Welcome home, Susan.
You took your time!
I don't do family reunions.
Sandman.
Soul Cake Duck.
Tooth Fairy.
The Hogfather!
Grandfather, what have you done?
This cushion is still uncomfortable.
You're doing well, master.
Soot in the fireplaces, footprints, swigged sherries sleigh tracks all over the roofs.
No, no.
It's got to work.
You think so?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, here's a little tip, though.
"Ho, ho, ho," will do.
Don't say, "Cower, brief mortals!" (imitates threatening cackle)
Oh.
Really?
Hmm.
So many chimneys...
It would be so much quicker if I lost the cushion.
If we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
Er, I mean the Hogfather.
So you've got to look the part, master.
I tell you what'd be really good to boost belief is a public appearance.
Oh, I don't normally do them.
Yeah, but the Hogfather's more of a public figure, master.
I tell you what, one good public appearance would do more good than any amount of letting the kids see you by accident.
Really?
And I know just the place.
(festive music)
Thank you very much indeed.
Everything tickety-boo, McPherson?
- Yes, Mr Crumley.
- Jolly good.
Let's go... sleigh them.
I don't know if you noticed, Albert, but that was a pune,
- or play on words.
- Ho, ho, ho, sir.
(hogs squeal)
Oh!
(squeals)
(all squeal ferociously)
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
You're frightening the little kiddies!
- Wow, they got tusks!
Cool!
- That one's doing a wee.
It's the Campaign for Equal Heights that have done this, isn't it?
They're out to ruin me!
That's it!
I don't mind the smell of the oranges and the damp trousers, but I ain't putting up with this!
And he's not even doing it right!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
Come on!
(yelps)
Who are you?
You can call me Uncle Heavy.
- You're not a pixie.
- No, I'm a fairy cobbler, mister!
Now, just ssh!
Keep quiet!
And what do you want for Hogswatch, small human?
The autobiographies write down everything that happens to you as it happens.
I know.
I used to live here, remember?
But I can't read this.
The letters are all... odd.
Oh, so I suppose now you'll be wanting my words of occult wisdom.
Ethereal runes.
The Hogfather ain't human, after all.
Er, I suppose a bit of warm liver's out of the question?
~ On the second day of Hogswatch
~ I sent my true love back
~ A nasty little letter
~ And a partridge in a pear tree
What's your game?
Small-time thief, are you?
You ain't supposed to be able to see me.
I'm a wizard!
We can see things that are really there, you know.
Er, what's in this bag?
You'll really wish you hadn't, mister.
Oh, will I?
What are you doing here, young man?
Well, you know the Tooth Fairy?
Well, it's sort of like the same business.
- You take things away?
- Not take away as such...
More sort of bring.
- Ah.
Right, new teeth.
- Like new verrucas.
Ugh!
Oh, you're him.
I saw your piggy do a wee.
Oh?
Well... good.
It had a great big...
- What do you want for Hogswatch?
- She wants...
I want an army and a big castle with an active drawbridge and a sword.
(clears throat)
I think they're supposed to say thank you.
Are you sure?
People don't normally.
No, I meant to the Hogfather, which is you!
Right?
- Sorry.
- Yes, of course.
(clears throat) You are supposed to say thank you.
'Nk you.
And be good.
This is part of the arrangement.
- Yes.
- Then, we have a contract.
(chuckles)
- Ah, verrucas, eh?
- Wish I knew why.
- Do you mean you don't know?
- No!
Suddenly I wake up and I'm the Verruca Gnome!
Why, how strange!
Anyway...
amazing bathroom, isn't it?
(chuckles) It's even got a special pot for your toenail clippings.
- For your toenail clippings?
- Well, you can't be too careful.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clippings, hair, teeth, you've got them under your control.
I mean, that's real old magic.
(Teatime) Children of the world, prepare to think as you are told.
Mr Sideney?
Your big... no-misjudgements magic moment.
(gasps) You can't give her that!
It's not safe!
It's a sword.
They're not meant to be safe.
- But she's a child!
- It's educational.
What if she cuts herself?
That will be an important lesson.
(whispers)
(Death) Really?
Oh, well.
It's not for me to argue, I suppose.
And she doesn't want all that other stuff.
She's a girl!
And anyway, I can't afford big posh stuff like that.
I thought I gave it away.
- You do?
- You do?
You don't!
That's our merchandise!
You don't just give it away.
Hogswatch isn't about giving everything away.
I mean, yes, you do give things away, but you have to buy them first.
You mean... this is all... free?
It... would seem... to be.
So, Mr Stibbons, this thing's a great big artificial brain, then, eh?
You could think of it like that.
Of course, Hex doesn't actually think, not as such.
- It just appears to be thinking.
- Amazing!
You mean it gives the impression of thinking, but it's just a show?
- Er, yes.
- Just like everyone else, then, eh?
I knew I'd come here for something.
(chuckles) Now, this little chappie is the Verruca Gnome who's just popped into existence to be with us on Hogswatch Night, being the most magical night of the year.
Last year's occult rubbish piling up...
I thought you chaps might like to check up on it.
The Verruca Gnome?
Well, it makes about as much sense as anything else, doesn't it?
After all, there's a Tooth Fairy, isn't there?
Makes one wonder why there's a god of wine
- and not a god of hangovers.
- (faint jingling)
Anyone hear a noise just then?
Sorry, Archchancellor?
- A sort of...
- (imitates jingling sound)
Like a lot of, er... tinkling bells?
I didn't hear anything like that, sir.
Oh.
Well, where was I?
Erm...
Yes, well, I mean, nobody's ever seen a Verruca Gnome until tonight.
I've never heard of me until tonight, and I am me!
Well, erm, we'll see what Hex can find out, Archchancellor.
Good man.
- (bell rings / gears grind)
- Amazing!
Now we should be able to get to the bottom of all this.
None of this is right.
Everyone knows he's just a jolly old fat man who hands out presents to kids.
(raven) He wasn't always so jolly.
- You know how it is.
- Do I?
Well, it's like, you know, industrial retraining.
Even gods have to move with the times.
You see, your Hogfather was probably just your basic winter demiurge, you know, blood on the snow, making the sun come up...
So there has to be blood to make the sun come up?
(raven) Hmm!
Well, it starts off with animal sacrifice, hunt some big, hairy animal to death, that kind of stuff, very folkloric, very... mythic.
Didn't stop at animals, neither.
They had sacred kings, the strongest and the best, died at the dark time of year to give life to the unconquered sun.
And in a way, the Hogfather was all of 'em.
- And then?
- Then some bright spark thought,
"Looks like that damn sun comes up anyway, so how come we're giving those Druids all this free grub?"
The world moves on, and he's got to find a new job.
So he started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up?
Exactimundo.
And now he gives out presents.
(sobs)
- (sobs)
- Top of the evenin', squire.
I am Corporal Nobbs of the Watch, and this is Constable Visit, sir.
I want you to arrest him!
- Arrest who, sir?
- The Hogfather!
What for, sir?
He's sitting up there as bold as brass in his... grotto giving away presents!
Not quite up to speed here, sir.
I thought the Hogfather was supposed to give away stuff.
But this one's... an impostor!
You know, I always thought that.
I thought, the Hogfather spends two weeks sitting in a wooden grotto in some shop in Ankh-Morpork, very busy time, too.
Nice life, eh?
He's not the Hogfather we usually have!
You mean a different impostor?
Not the real impostor at all?
Yes!
No!
Arrest the Hogfather style of thing?
- Yes!
- On Hogswatch Night?
- Yes.
- For giving away presents?
- (laughs)
- In front of all these kiddies?
Yes!
- In your shop?
- Y...
You think...
that might look a bit... bad?
Difficult to see how it could look good, sir.
Could you not do it...
surreptitiously?
Oh, well!
Yes.
Surreptition.
Yes.
We could give that a try.
You won't find me ungrateful.
In Omnia, we call Hogswatch Night the Fast of St Ossory.
But it is not an occasion for superstition and crass commercialism.
I used to hang up my stocking every Hogswatch, regular.
All that ever happened was my dad was sick in it once.
I'm going in.
(eerie noise)
(teeth continue to explode)
There seems to be a thaumic surge from somewhere.
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
It's the expression on their little faces I like.
Yeah, a sort of cross between fear and and awe.
They don't know whether to laugh, cry or wet their pants.
Yes.
Now, that is what I call belief.
Next.
And what's your name, little person?
Nobby Nobbs, Hogfather.
And have you been a good bo?
A good dwa?
A good gno?
A good individual?
Yes.
So why isn't it working?
Er, the chalk...
just got a bit scuffed, you know, when we were piling up the... the things.
- You're sure that's what it is?
- Well, er...
What about the spell?
That'll go on forever.
Simple ones do.
It's just a state change, powered by the... the...
It just keeps going.
That's very good, Mr Sideney.
Because if the sympathetic magic doesn't work, you will find me very unsympathetic.
(whimpers)
What happened?
What happened?
Ah, it's disgusting, this whole business!
It is the worship of idols!
It's a genuine Burleigh Stronginthearm double-action triple-cantilever crossbow with a polished-walnut stock and... silver engraved facings.
Aren't we going to arrest the impostor, Corporal?
You're foreign, Washpot.
I can't expect you to know the real meaning of Hogswatch.
On the whole, I think that went very well, don't you?
Yes, master.
And I think I've got the laugh working really well now.
- (enthusiastically) Ho, ho, ho!
- Yes, sir.
Very jolly.
Tomorrow morning, they'll believe, alright.
They'd better.
Because if they don't, then, there won't be a tomorrow morning.
So for the sun to come up tomorrow, the Hogfather has to be alive.
Precise-amente.
But what if he's dead?
(heavy footsteps)
(eerie noises)
And this was gonna be your big... moment.
(hogs squeal)
(caws)
It's him!
Such a shame!
Pretty lights... (whooshing)
Think... happy, Banjo.
(rumbling)
Wake up!
Wake up!
You've got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
You're not the Hogfather.
There must be thousands here.
What's all this stuff?
It's just paper.
They're title deeds to properties, and they're better than money.
So if we steal them, do they become ours?
Is that a trick question?
Anyway, let's get going.
He won't miss a few, er...
- Gentlemen.
- (Chickenwire) We were just, er...
We were just... piling up the stuff.
Hah!
- (giggles nervously) - (grunts)
(knife slips out of sheath)
Hmm!
I know people say
I'd kill them as soon as look at them.
In fact, I'd much rather kill you than look at you, Mr Lilywhite.
You're thinking that Banjo's gonna help you.
That's how its always been, isn't it?
But Banjo's my friend now.
Banjo has the heart...
of a little child.
And believe, I have, too.
Help him, Banjo.
As far as this goes, I really have no use for it.
It's only pillow money.
Something much more... interesting has become apparent.
(creaking)
(metallic grinding)
Albert...
I don't see the Hogfather as someone who rolls his own.
(rumbling)
Drop him.
Control.
Control the inner child, and it'll even give you its teeth.
And somewhere in this tower, you're gonna help me find someone who can use it who can use it to...
give me the world.
So, is he saying to take the money and go?
Don't be so bloody stupid!
Daddy?
I say...
It's not what you think!
Yes, it is.
(clock chimes)
Mr Brown?
There's one door you haven't found.
Find the Tooth Fairy's secret room.
And when he does then, just think what I can make the kiddiewinks think.
(rumbling)
(moaning)
(groaning)
(moaning)
(moaning)
- Are you alright?
- I wish I was dead.
I think you may have come to the right place.
- Oh, my head...
- Are you the Hogfather?
I feel awful!
Have you got any ice?
Duty calls.
Yeah, but which one?
That one or this one?
(screams)
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
(giggles madly)
Everything starts somewhere although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where.
Where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that, the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle, the great A'Tuin.
It was some time after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories of the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis.
"Things just happen.
What the hell?"
Our story began in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld, a city where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for Wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets below.
Our story continues in the middle of the night before Hogswatch, a midwinter festival, which, for some reason, bears a remarkable similarity to your Christmas, that now takes us to the Tooth Fairy's castle,
where magic has made children's teeth perilously powerful, so that our story is much sooner rather than later about blood.
Mr Teatime!
There you are.
I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
I'm not telling you anything.
Who are you, anyway?
I'm glad you asked.
I'm your worst nightmare.
Oh.
You mean the one with the giant cabbage and the, kind of, whirling-knife thing?
Sorry, no.
Not that one.
I'm the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you, stone dead.
Oh.
Oh, that one.
But that's not...
Rather a charitable act there, I feel.
But it is nearly Hogswatch after all.
Bring me the girl.
Odd.
Oh.
It's a scythe job, then.
They took the teeth.
All of them.
They just walked in and they... they...
No!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
- Where did he come from?
- A place I cannot go.
Well, even if you could go there, we've got our work cut out here keeping the Hogfather's seat warm.
If what's happening in the Tooth Fairy's castle isn't stopped, then, everything we've been doing is a waste of time.
And if they get to the Tooth Fairy, they will be able to control all human belief.
- Unless Susan gets there first.
- (hogs squeal)
Yes, well, it's coming along well.
Very impressive.
Well done.
(heavy thud at door)
- I need your help, Mr Ridcully.
- (mutters) You...
You're...
Yes.
The scythe, the cloak, the white horse, the granddaughter.
(all gasp)
I need you to wake him up.
- His name's Bilious.
- (all gasp)
He's the Oh God of Hangovers.
Something nasty's happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is but he's got to be able to think straight first.
- And you brought him here?
- (all murmur)
(muffled chatter)
Why are you doing this?
- I was behind with the teeth...
- Is she behind this door?
Don't know.
There was nearly $13
- in pillow money owing.
- This her door?
But I filed the form...
Will you just shut up and answer the question?
I don't know.
I've never been here before.
Then, your boss probably doesn't realise
- how irritating you are.
- (yelps)
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Or Miss Bottler gets it.
It was only a bit of loose change!
And I really, I was going to... 10 Scrote...
Have you got the list?
(clanging)
(Death) This is really, really stupid.
I think the tradition got started when everybody had them big chimbleys, master.
Ooh!
(screams)
(Death) Indeed.
It's only a mercy it's unlit.
(muffled yelling through pipe)
(yelps)
(rumbling on ceiling / thud)
- Oof!
- (pats snow off himself)
(Death) The boy wants a pair of trousers that he doesn't have to share, a huge meat pie, a sugar mouse, a lot of toys and a puppy called Scruff.
Aw, how sweet.
I shall wipe away a tear.
Cos what he's getting, you see, is this little wooden toy
- and an apple.
- But the letter clearly...
I know.
It's the socioeconomic factors.
I mean, the world would be in a hell of a mess, wouldn't it, if everybody got what they asked for?
I gave them what they wanted in the store.
What good is a god that gives you everything that you want?
- You have me there.
- Ah, yeah.
No, it's the hope that's important.
Oh, yes.
It's a big part of belief, is the hope.
I mean, say you give people jam today and they'll just sit there and eat it.
But jam tomorrow?
Ah, no.
That'll keep 'em going forever.
And you mean that because of this, the poor get poor things and the rich get rich things?
Well, yeah.
It's the meaning of Hogswatch, innit, master?
But I'm the Hogfather!
At the moment, I mean.
Well, it makes no difference.
Hmm.
I remember when I was a nipper.
It was one Hogswatch, it was and I had my heart set on this huge model horse in this shop.
It was what I always wanted.
Someone was in there, buying it, and, do you know, just for a second,
I thought it really was going to be for me.
(door shuts)
But it wasn't.
I spent hours with me nose pressed up against the window, till someone heard me calling and unfroze me.
Yes, I would've killed for that horse.
But you know what?
I still hung up my stocking on Hogswatch Eve.
And do you know why?
Cos I had hope!
Yeah.
And the next morning, our dad had put in my stocking a little wooden horse that he had carved his very own self.
Ah, and that was worth more than all the expensive toy horses in the world?
No, cos you're a selfish little bugger when you're only seven.
It's only grown-ups that think like that.
This is wrong.
It is... unfair.
Well, that's life, innit, master, eh?
But I'm not.
This is supposed to be the season to be jolly.
- Hmm.
- And other things ending in "olly".
(whooshing)
(puppy yaps)
- (muffled cries)
- Please.
Just take her out of vocal range.
Mr Brown.
Your big moment.
Break me out the real Tooth Fairy.
- (groans)
- Oh, come along, lad.
If you're the Lecturer in Recent Runes, can't you do something more, well, magical?
Well, Spold's Unstirring Divisor would do it.
You would end up with a large beaker filled with all the nastiness.
It's not difficult at all, if you don't mind the side effects.
Tell me about the side effects.
Well, the main one is that the rest of him would end up in a somewhat larger beaker.
- Alive?
- Well, broadly, yes.
Living tissue, certainly.
And definitely sober.
Why don't we just mix up absolutely everything
- and see what happens?
- (all chuckle)
It's got to be worth a try.
Ah.
Thank you, my dear.
A-ha!
Will this take much longer?
We may not have much time.
Oh, you can't be too careful.
(groans)
- What's that?
- Ssh.
Wow-Wow sauce.
The hottest sauce in the universe.
And it'll blow your head clean off.
It's not safe to drink if the sweat is still condensing on the bottle.
On the other hand, (laughs) If it is a kill-or-cure remedy, then, we are, given the possibility that the patient is immortal probably onto a winner.
(whimpers)
I wonder if it's gone critical yet.
(sighs in relief)
(all whimper)
I don't know.
I wish you fellas would show some backbone.
(screams)
(gurgling)
Careful, Archchancellor!
What you have there may represent pure sobriety.
(all murmur)
- I'll try it.
- (all gasp)
(gulps)
(chuckles)
(all groan)
You did say he was immortal, didn't you?
- And you mean... he just appeared?
- Yes!
He has no memory of existing before appearing at the Hogfather's castle.
You mean, like this fellow?
Don't be ridiculous.
Gods and gnomes don't appear en masse for no reason.
Bring me, let's see, 20 pints of lager, some pepper vodka and bottle of coffee liqueur.
I didn't have you sobered up just so you could go on a binge.
- You don't drink.
- I don't?
Oh.
Yeah.
- I need you to help me.
- Oh.
I'm afraid I did it, didn't I?
I, erm, I said something to young Stibbons about drinking and hangovers, didn't I?
You mean you created it just like that?
Oh, I find that very hard to believe, Mustrum.
Good job nobody mentioned the Hair Loss Fairy, then!
- (all chuckle)
- I am not losing my hair.
It is just very finely spaced.
Yes, half on your head and half on your hairbrush.
For the last time, I am not... (jingling)
I wish I knew where that was coming from.
We need a bigger brain for this.
That thinking engine of yours working, Ponder?
Er, Hex is resting, Archchancellor.
(shouts) Can you hear me in there?
You don't have to shout, Archchancellor.
What is that "ning-ning, ning-ning, ning-ning" noise all about?
It says, "Look at the Dean."
"Look at the...
Dean."
Is there a problem?
(all laugh)
- Are you the Hair Loss Fairy?
- Apparently.
What have you been doing with my hair?
Just a minute.
Where exactly were you before I found you in the snow?
Anywhere where drink had been consumed in beastly quantities
- sometime previously, you could say.
- (Mustrum) A-ha.
- You were an imminent vital force?
- Oh, sounds great!
(chuckles)
What is that?
(Mustrum) So, when we joked about the Hair Loss Fairy, it suddenly focused on the Dean's head.
(all laugh)
You're calling things into being.
I personally have always wondered if there was an Eater of Socks.
You know how there's always one missing?
(jingling)
- Ah!
To the laundry!
- (all shout)
Tell me again who these people are.
Some of the cleverest men in the world.
And I'm sober, am I?
(glass smashes)
What is that ridiculous thing on your head?
(slurred) I don't know, sir!
What?
What is it?
It says here... (clears throat)
"If found, please return to the Tooth Fairy's castle."
Well, thank goodness the Tooth Fairy already exists, hey?
Tooth Fairy?
Oh, you see her around a lot these days.
Or them, rather.
It's a sort of franchise operation to collect children's teeth in exchange for money.
And she has a castle.
She sounds great.
Actually, I do remember one thing.
When I appeared at the Hogfather's house, there was this drunken little fellow in a pointy hat.
I thought it was just the drink talking, but he did mention something about the permanent end of perpetual servitude for the little helpers of all fantasy personifications!
(laughs)
Including the Tooth Fairy.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
Where did you find this?
(groans)
(Billy) Is he alright?
I say, what is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's castle?
- Now I'm feeling normal, can I come?
- This is not a normal situation.
Look, I think I'd better tell you.
- My grandfather is Death.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Death.
You know, death.
The robes, the scythe, the white horse, bones.
Death.
But at the moment, he's acting rather strange.
I want to make sure I've got this clear.
You think your grandfather is Death and you think he's acting strange?
Look, Death adopted my mother.
He then took on a human apprentice.
They fell in love and I'm the result.
This is fascinating.
Let's say I picked up a few strange genetic knacks along the way.
- Now, that looks dangerous.
- I hope so.
- Wait!
I could help you!
- Would you be any good in a fight?
Er, yes.
I could be sick on people.
(groans)
(whining)
- (snarls)
- Shoo!
Shoo!
Whoa!
- There he is!
Watch yourselves!
- (Mustrum) We have to sort this out.
We can't have creatures popping into existence just because people are talking about them.
Unhygienic.
So, what is this implied creation, then?
"Humans have always ascribed random, seasonal, natural or inexplicable actions to human-shaped entities."
"Such examples are the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy and Death."
Well, that's all very well, but I'm damn sure there's never been an Eater of Socks or an Oh God of Hangovers.
I think it works like this.
What we're getting is the personification of forces,
- just like Hex said.
- A bit like the Hogfather?
I mean, when you're a kiddie, it's as good an explanation as any as where presents come from.
But why is it happening now?
(Hex rattles)
"Beliefs causing new creatures to appear."
You could put it like that.
"There's a finite quantity of belief in the universe."
Well, certainly people can only believe in so many things.
"It follows that if a major focus of belief is removed, there will be spare belief."
Alright, then.
Well, I just don't...
What are people not believing in all of a sudden, then?
"Out of cheese error."
"Melon.
Melon.
Melon."
"Redo from start."
It's Hogswatch.
I suppose the Hogfather is around, isn't he?
I like this job.
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
Excuse me.
Yes.
This will show them.
(cracks whip)
But Poor Little Match Girl dying in the snow is all part of the spirit of Hogswatch, master.
You see, people hear about it and they say,
"We might be as poor as a disabled banana and only can afford to eat mud and boots, but see how much better off we are than the Poor Little Match Girl!"
That makes them happy and grateful for what they have got.
I know what the spirit of Hogswatch is, Albert.
(electric fizzling)
You're not allowed to do that.
The Hogfather can.
The Hogfather gives presents.
There's no better present than the future.
That's it.
I've had enough of this pixie lark.
I'm waiting for the Hogfather.
I'm in the dark, waiting for the Hogfather.
Me.
A believer in natural philosophy.
I can find the square root of 27.4 in my head.
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's not as if I've hung a stocking up.
There'd be some point if...
Take her somewhere warm and give her a good dinner.
And I may well be checking up later.
Looks like we've been chosen to do a bit of charity.
Well, I don't call it very charitable, just dumping someone on people like this.
I dunno.
Some people wouldn't know the real meaning of Hogswatch if it jumped up and clocked 'em in the gob.
(rumbling)
No!
This is a child's painting.
Twyla paints like that.
I painted like that.
Grandfather saved some of my draw...
Come on.
Let's find the house.
- What house?
- There's always a house.
I was told you were the best locksmith in the city.
Locks don't generally alter themselves while you're working on them, that's what I'm saying.
(whispers) Are you the best or not?
(rumbling)
No!
Not the dark!
Banjo.
I'm getting out of here.
There's something wrong with this place.
I made a big pile.
Do you want to come with me?
It's pretty here.
Mr Sideney.
(sighs)
Would he deliver to apes earlier than to humans?
Interesting point, sir.
Possibly you're referring to my theory that humans may have descended from apes.
A bold hypothesis, which, if the Grants Committee could just see their way clear to letting me hire a boat and sail around to the islands... (all grumble)
I just thought he might deliver alphabetically.
(rustling)
(all murmur anxiously)
(Death) Let me see, now.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Hogfather, of course.
Erm... ho, ho, ho.
You look extremely thin in the face.
I...
I'm, er...
I'm a bit ill.
- (all mutter)
- Oh.
Terminally, I would say.
A-ha!
It's a false beard.
- No, it's not.
- It's got hooks for the ears.
That must've given you a spot of trouble there.
It's a pillow!
(all chuckle)
I thought there were seven locks.
Yeah, but they're half magic, half real and half not there.
There's parts of 'em don't exist half the time.
I thought you could open any lock anyone ever made.
Made by humans and most dwarves.
I don't know what made these.
You never said anything about magic... (rumbling)
That's a shame.
Then, really, I have no more need of your services.
- You may as well go back home.
- What about my money?
Of course.
You should get what you deserve.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr Tea Cup.
I'm leaving with what's coming to me and you ain't stopping me.
Banjo certainly ain't.
I knew his old ma in the good old days.
You think you're nasty?
You think you're mean?
Ma Lilywhite'd tear your ears off and spit 'em in your eyes.
Cocky little devil.
I remember you when you was little, Banjo.
- I used to sit you on my knees.
- Banjo... (clicks fingers)
There you are.
Where's all these shadows coming from?
It's giving me the creeps!
It's all your fault.
Oh, yeah?
So it wasn't you who said, "Wow. $10,000.
Count me in!"
But I didn't know there'd be all this creepy stuff!
I wanna go home.
It's like dealing with a child!
(screaming)
(man continues to fall)
Poor guy must have slipped.
Yeah.
Slipped.
That's the Tooth Fairy's castle?
- It's teeth.
- And I should be scared?
There's nothing that scary about teeth.
Did I say I was scared?
I must just be hungover again.
- Oh, no.
- They're only teeth.
(Chickenwire) Oi!
- Surely no one would try to...
- What is that?
It's such old magic, it isn't even magic any more.
If you've got a piece of someone's hair, nail clipping or tooth, you can control them.
- Don't tell me someone's...
- (rumbling)
- What's that shadow?
- This place is alive.
And it's protecting itself.
So, what happened to the other fellow?
Well the Hogfather has enemies.
- What did he do, miss a chimney?
- (all chuckle)
(recites incantation)
There's, er, there's people down there, Mr Teatime.
Well, just do away with them.
Well, er, one of them's a girl.
Then, do away with them... politely.
Keep going.
Quicker.
(shrieks) It's after me!
(continues to shriek) Let me out!
- What was that?
- It's finding their nightmares.
(shrieks)
Let me out!
It's after me!
Pull yourself together.
Look around.
There's nothing chasing you.
I thought it was the... wardrobe.
What wardrobe?
When I was a kid, we had this big... wardrobe.
And it had this... this...
On the door, it had this face!
And at night, it whispered things.
- (creaking)
- Who's that moving up there?
I think they saw us.
And if they're tooth fairies, there's been a really stupid equal-opportunities policy.
Right.
You go that way, I'll go this way.
- Why don't we stay together?
- What's got into you?
Hmm?
This is a children's place.
The rules are what children believe.
- Well, that's a relief.
- You think so?
It's impossible to die here.
My grandfather doesn't figure in a child's world.
That man who fell down the stairs looked pretty dead.
Oh, you die.
But not here.
You...
Let's see.
Yes.
- You go somewhere else.
Away.
- (muffled cries)
- (screams) Aren't you Susan?
- Yes.
When you came for Twyla's last tooth, you were shocked I could see you.
- Oh, yes, and I saw...
- We may not have a lot of time.
Is this... the Tooth Fairy?
A tooth fairy.
Do you... drink at all?
No, I don't.
Not touch alcohol at all?
Never.
My dad's very strict about that sort of thing.
Nice castle.
Can we get on?
Good.
Who brought you here, Violet?
I don't know.
But he's dressed like an assassin.
OK.
You two stay here.
I'll go find him.
And I'll look after Violet.
(giggles)
(fizzing / lock clicks)
That's the fourth lock open.
I commend your expertise.
And the others?
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?
Logically, if you're the guardian of children's beliefs and this is your castle and I come across as securely locked a door as this then, not to thoroughly investigate would lack elegance.
(metallic scraping)
What's that sound?
- What sound?
- That sound.
Like old scissors scraping.
Have you ever heard of the Auditors?
Well, I suppose that the Bursar might have done.
Not auditors of money.
Auditors of reality.
They are the civil service of everything.
- (all mumble)
- And they want to get rid of us?
They want humans to be...
less creative.
The Hogfather is a symbol of this.
(bones crack loudly)
Strange thinking.
They hate the way humans make up stories about the universe.
I can't think why. (chuckles)
And you, why are you doing this job?
(Death) Someone must.
It is vitally important.
Before dawn, there must be enough belief in the Hogfather.
- Why?
- So that the sun will come up.
(all chuckle)
I seldom joke.
(Violet) What sort of godding do you do?
Oh, I'm the, er, I'm the Oh God of Hangovers.
- A god of hangovers?
Oh, how awful.
- I suppose so.
You're more cut out to be one of those important gods.
- Oh!
- What's this, eh?
Lovers' Lane?
You leave him alone, you!
He's a god!
A god?
Dear me!
Out of thunderbolts, are we?
Well, you know, I've never killed a g...
(creaking)
(creaking)
(groans)
What's the matter?
It's just a wardrobe, innit?
(pants / shrieks)
I don't want to see!
I don't want to see.
Hex was right, Archchancellor.
Hex?
Who is Hex?
Erm, he's the biggest thinker in the world.
I would like to meet this Mr Hex.
- (shrieking) - (all gasp)
(all mutter)
Quite a large thaumic reading, gentlemen.
I think he got here by magic.
- (all mumble)
- Where did he go?
They say you are the biggest thinker in the world, but do you also believe?
Extend logically the result of the human race ceasing to believe in the Hogfather.
Will the sun come up?
Answer.
Correct.
How may this be prevented?
Answer.
"Regular and consistent belief."
Good.
I have a task for you, thinking engine.
Believe in the Hogfather.
Do you believe?
Answer.
Do you believe?
Answer!
Good.
(pen scratches on paper)
Hmm. (mumbles under breath)
Oh, no!
(sighs)
Let me see.
How old are you?
And have you been naughty or nice?
(safe clicks)
Hello.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
Bone handle.
Rather tasteless skull-and-bone decoration.
Death himself's second-favourite weapon.
Am I right?
Oh, my.
It must be Hogswatch.
This must mean that you are Susan.
The famous granddaughter.
Nobility.
I'd bow, but I'm afraid you'd do something dreadful.
- (lock clicks) - (Sideney) Yes!
Yes!
Left-handed using a wooden pick.
It's so simple!
Ah!
Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh, I've managed to open the fifth lock.
No problem.
They're just based on Woddeley's Occult Sequence.
(chuckles)
- How do you know who I am?
- Easy.
Twurp's Peerage.
Family motto, non timetis messor.
Your father was well known.
Went a long way very fast.
As for your grandfather, honestly, that motto, "fear not the reaper", is that good taste?
Course, you don't need to fear him, do you?
Or do you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who are you, anyway?
I beg your pardon.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Jonathan Teh-ah-tim-eh at your service.
You mean...
like around four o'clock in the afternoon?
No.
I did say...
Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Please don't try to break my concentration by annoying me.
(Sideney recites incantation)
- How are you getting on, Mr Sideney?
- Oh!
Er... (Teatime) According to Woddeley's Sequence, number six should be copper and blue-green light.
You think your grandfather will try to rescue you?
But now I have his sword.
You see, I wonder...
- (lock unlocks)
- All fingers and thumbs, Mr Sideney.
Er, I've managed to open the sixth lock, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Really?
But it may not be all-important now.
Thank you, anyway.
You've been most helpful.
- Erm...
- Yes.
You may go.
Is that all you're here for?
A robbery, like a petty thief?
A thief?
Me?
I'm not a thief, madam.
No.
These gentlemen are thieves.
That's Medium Dave.
And Exhibit B is Banjo.
He can talk.
(gasps) Who are you?
I'm incognito.
You look like a wizard to me.
(yelps)
Did you suck your thumb when you were little?
Nope!
(metallic swishing)
- Is that the Scissor Man?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Kids believe all kinds of crap, but I'm a grown-up now, so... (screams)
No more Hogfather.
And that's only the start.
I'll be able to make people believe anything I want.
(Banjo) What's this?
You said, "No more Hogfather."
He does know what we've been doing here, doesn't he?
You did tell him?
There's gotta be a Hogfather.
There's always a Hogfather.
- She did it!
She killed him.
- No, I didn't.
He...
- Did!
- Didn't.
- Did.
- What's this about the Hogfather?
I don't think he's dead, but Teatime has made him very ill.
Who cares?
When this is over, Banjo, you'll have as many presents as you want.
Trust me.
There has to be a Hogfather, else there's no Hogswatch.
- It's just another solar festival.
- Banjo and me are going.
Banjo, you're coming with me right now.
Grab her, Banjo.
It's all her fault.
Our mam said no hitting girls.
No touching them or pulling them hair.
She's not a girl.
She's a freak.
I think I know you, Teatime.
You're the mad kid they're all scared of, right?
- Banjo, I said grab her.
- Our mam said...
The kid who didn't know the difference between chucking a stone at a cat and setting it on fire.
I said shut up.
Get her, Banjo.
The kind of little boy who looks up dolls' dresses.
- I didn't.
- Our mam said...
Ah, to blazes with your mam!
What did you say about our mam?
I bet no one wanted to play with you.
- Not the kid with no friends.
- Banjo, you do as I tell you.
Our mam...
Our mam...
Our mam said...
Have you been a bad boy, Banjo?
You been letting him get into trouble again, our Davey?
You have, haven't you?
No, Mam.
No, Mam.
No, Mam!
You need a good hiding, Banjo.
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, Mam!
You been playing with girls again?
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, Mam!
Sorry, Mam!
Sorry!
No, Mam.
No, Mam.
No, Mam!
(shouts) No!
(cackles)
Oh, no.
I don't think so.
This place gets into your head, doesn't it?
It... finds out how to deal with you.
But I'm in touch with my inner child.
It's so much fun.
No pulling girls' hair.
That's bad.
I'm gonna have so much fun with this.
So light.
You dare!
My grandfather will come after you.
- He comes after everyone.
- He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
(giggles)
It doesn't work here.
There's no death here.
Hi, inner child.
I'm the inner baby-sitter.
(cloth rips)
- Happy Hogswatch!
- (all cheer)
(all chatter merrily)
Is he dead?
He's not breathing.
Breathing spell.
Breathing spell.
(mutters)
Spolt's forthright respirator, perhaps.
I think I've got it written down somewhere.
Come on, chaps.
Give me some space.
(whooshing)
Excuse me... excuse me, but this is vitally important for the advancement of natural philosophy.
Did you see any bright lights?
A shining tunnel?
What is all this, Mr Stibbons?
Put the damn quill away.
This must be the Unseen University.
And you're all... wizards.
There was a sword.
Oh, yes.
It's, er, fallen on the floor.
Did I do that?
I really must be off.
(all mutter)
Well, he won't get far.
The main doors are locked, in accordance with Archchancellor Spold's rules.
- Won't get far?
- No!
While holding a sword which appears to be able to cut through anything?
(thud)
You can get into trouble, hitting girls.
No playing with girls.
What am I gonna do now?
(blows nose)
(lock clicks)
Hello, my dear.
No.
Sorry, dear?
You're not the Tooth Fairy.
Oh, I am, dear.
(Susan) Oh, Grandma, what big teeth you have.
You've even got a shawl.
Oh, dear.
I don't understand, lovey.
You forgot the rocking chair.
I always thought there'd be a rocking chair.
I don't think you're real.
It's not a little old woman in a shawl running this place.
You're out of my head.
That's how you defend yourself.
You poke around in people's heads and find the things that work...
No.
It's horrible, but it doesn't frighten me.
I like spiders.
Dogs?
No.
I like rats.
Rats are fine.
(growls)
Sorry, is anyone frightened of that?
(distorted) I...
I...
You're a bogeyman, aren't you?
Not a.
The!
The first bogeyman.
- You look terrible.
- Thank you very much.
I mean ill.
I used to jump out on them and say, "Boo!" (chuckles) Yeah.
But then I got to like 'em.
Only children were frightened of me.
I mean, what's to be scared of?
Horns, bony arms.
But then I discovered that there were much worse things than me and I wanted to protect the children, keep them safe from all the really bad things.
So I built all this to be a safe place.
And the teeth?
(chuckles) If you leave all those teeth around,
- anything could happen.
- Anything nearly did.
So, you are the Tooth Fairy, then?
Yes!
I...
Oh...
Then they came, stealing.
I'm too weak to look after them any more.
(groans)
You don't die here.
You just get old.
- Listening to the laughter.
- (echoing laughter)
(Susan) Don't worry about the teeth.
I'll make them safe again.
I think it would be a good idea if you did the Tooth Fairy's job, Banjo.
Do...
Do you think that'd be alright?
Won't the Tooth Fairy mind?
You...
Do it until she comes back.
So, er, who's gonna tell me what to do?
(Susan) No one's ever going to tell you what to do again, Banjo.
Thanks, miss.
I'll keep the teeth safe.
- Er, miss?
- Yes, Banjo?
Can I have a puppy?
I had a kitten, but our mam drownded it cos it was dirty.
I think it'll turn up quite soon, Banjo.
Thanks, miss.
Billy!
Violet's talked about it.
We thought we ought to come back and help.
- (Susan) It's OK.
They're all gone.
- Oh.
And Banjo needed a new job.
That's funny.
So does Billy.
Look, why don't you two make yourselves useful and help Banjo clear up this mess?
He's pretty much running the place now.
- (laughs) Oh, but he's...
- He's in charge.
We'd love to help, Banjo.
Together.
Good.
Have fun.
Now I'm going home.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
(whooshing)
Grandfather!
What are you doing here?
It is not over.
You must bring the Hogfather home.
These look like the mountains where the Castle of Bones was.
They are.
- It's a pig!
- A boar.
This boar is the?
(Death) Yes.
The Hogfather as he began.
- (Susan) And the dogs.
- (Death) These are not real dogs.
If they catch him, he won't just die.
He will... never be.
Well, stop them.
(Death) This is a human thing.
The Auditors are desperate now.
They're determined to destroy the Hogfather at whatever cost.
You must save him.
(dogs bark)
(squeals)
(dogs bark)
(dogs bark)
Come on.
Jump.
Just you try it.
(dog howls)
Yes!
Who wants some?
Anyone else?
(dogs whimper)
(thunder)
Ho, ho, ho.
- (dogs whimper)
- You couldn't resist it in the end.
A mistake, I fancy.
It gets under your skin, life.
Speaking metaphorically, of course.
And, you see, the more you struggle for every moment, the more alive you stay.
Which is where I come in, as a matter of fact.
You can't do this.
There are rules.
Yes, there are rules.
But you broke them.
How dare you.
How dare you!
And now there remains only one final question.
Have you been naughty or nice?
(thunder)
(flatly) Ho, ho, ho.
(sobs)
We saved you.
Dying's not how it's supposed to go!
(birds twitter)
(wings flap)
(roars)
(hogs grunt)
Er...
Er, sorry.
Hyah!
Well that about wraps it up for this dress.
I'd just like to ask, purely out of academic interest, you were sure I was going to survive, were you?
I was quite confident.
Good.
Now, tell me...
What would've happened if you hadn't saved him?
- Yes.
- The sun would not have risen.
Then what would've happened?
A mere ball of flaming gas would have illuminated the world.
Alright, I'm not stupid.
You're saying that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.
No.
Humans need fantasy to be human.
To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.
With tooth fairies, Hogfathers...
Yes.
As practice, you have to start out learning to believe the little lies.
- So we can believe the big ones?
- Yes.
Justice, mercy, duty, that sort of thing.
- But they're not the same at all.
- You think so?
Then, take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve, and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy.
And yet, you try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world, as if there is some...
some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.
But people have got to believe that, or what's the point?
You need to believe in things that aren't true.
How else can they become?
Er, would you like to visit for Hogswatch dinner?
Albert is frying a pudding.
I, er...
Well, they're really expecting me here.
Would you like a drink before you go?
A cup of cocoa would be appropriate in the circumstances.
Right.
There are biscuits in the tin on the mantelpiece.
- Susan's got a poker, you know.
- My goodness me.
I thought all of you knew that by now.
Indeed.
Last week, she picked a bogey up by its nose.
I'll give Gawain his stocking, then I'll come and watch.
Susan...
Well, well.
Now, this is... unexpected.
A family affair.
I wonder...
Is it possible to kill... death?
(Teatime) Hmm!
This must be a very special sword.
And it certainly works here.
And, of course, it might well not be regarded as murder.
Possibly it is... a civic act.
It would be, as they say the big one.
You may have some personal knowledge about your vulnerability, but I'm pretty certain that Susan here will quite definitely die.
So I'd rather you didn't try any last-minute stuff.
I am last-minute stuff.
(faint music)
I don't remember them asking for anything that made a noise.
Oh, there has to be something in the stocking that makes a noise.
Otherwise, what is 4:30am for?
There are children?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
- Call them.
- Certainly not.
It'll be instructive.
Educational.
And when your adversary is Death, you can't help but be the good guy.
Call them.
Gawain.
Twyla.
(Teatime) Come in.
Come in!
Curly haired tots!
I've caught this bogeyman.
What shall we do with him, huh?
It's only a skeleton!
Yes.
A nasty, creepy, horrible skeleton.
Scary, huh?
He's eating a biscuit.
A creepy, bony man in a black robe.
You're fidgeting with that kettle, so I expect you're thinking of doing something creative.
Put it down.
Please.
- Slowly.
- Huh!
That's not very creepy.
It's just bones.
It's just standing there.
It's not even making "whoo-whoo" noises.
And, anyway, you're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Really?
Well, let's see how creepy I can be.
(thud)
(gasps)
Oh, no!
Couldn't have gone through you.
There's so many ribs... and things.
It only kills monsters.
Stop time now.
You winked at me.
I thought you had a plan.
Indeed.
Oh, yes.
- I planned to see what you would do.
- What?
I did add the sparkly stars and the noise, though.
I thought they would be appropriate.
And if I hadn't done anything?
I dare say I would have thought of something
- at the last minute.
- That was the last minute.
There is always time for another last minute.
(sighs)
Stop playing dead, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.
You got it right.
Of course.
I'll take care of the body.
That will prevent inconvenient questions.
Erm, you did know the poker would go through me?
I was quite confident.
(Death) Ah.
I have made this for you.
Oh!
Thank you.
What is it?
(Death) Albert said there ought to be snow on it, but it appears to have melted.
It is, of course, a Hogswatch card.
Oh.
There should have been a robin on it as well, but I had considerable difficulty in getting it to stay on.
(Susan) Ah.
- It was not at all cooperative.
- Really?
It did not seem to get into the Hogswatch spirit at all.
Oh.
Thank you.
- Granddad?
- Yes?
Why?
I mean, why did you do all this?
Human beings make life so interesting.
Do you know that in a universe so full of wonders, they have managed to invent boredom?
- Quite astonishing.
- Oh.
Well, then, er...
Happy Hogswatch.
Yes.
Granddad.
Happy Hogswatch.
Happy Hogswatch and good night, children, everywhere.
(coughs)
(dog barks)
- Ooh!
Hello!
Hello!
- (dog barks)
Oh, you're cute. (chuckles) Yeah, come on.
Come on, let's play.
Yeah.
You have a big, wooden rocking horse in the window.
Er... yes.
That's a special order I made for...
Lord Rodney.
How much would this lordship have paid you?
- $12.
- I will give you 50.
Would you like me to wrap it, sir?
No.
I will take it as it is.
Thank you.
Incidentally, there is a small boy out there with his nose frozen to the window.
Some warm water should do the trick.
Happy Hogswatch, sir.
Everything starts somewhere although many physicists disagree.
There is the the constant desire to find out where.
Where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that, the Discworld was formed drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle, the great A'Tuin.
It was some time after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories of the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis.
"Things just happen.
What the hell?"
And so our story begins in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld, a city where magic is just another job, and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for Wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets.
Our story begins on a midwinter festival bearing a remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
And so.... it was the night before Hogswatch.
"And then Jack chopped down what was the world's last beanstalk, adding murder and ecological terrorism to the theft, enticement and trespass charges already mentioned, and all the giant's children didn't have a daddy any more."
"But he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done.
which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you are a hero, because no one asks inconvenient questions."
And now, it's time for bed.
- Susan?
- Yes?
You know last week when we wrote letters to the Hogfather?
- Yes?
- Well, will he really come?
And when's he coming here?
Does it matter, if you get the presents anyway?
Yes.
Well, if you don't believe in the Hogfather,
- there won't be any presents.
- Thought so.
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly fat man is about to deliver their presents not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit, especially in a city where there is a guild
for everything.
The doors are locked.
The windows are barred.
The dog does not appear to have woken up.
The squeaky floorboards haven't.
I really doubt that you are a ghost, and gods generally do not announce themselves so politely.
You could, of course, be Death, but I don't believe he bothers with such niceties.
Besides, I'm feeling quite well.
Hmm...
Good evening.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
You appear to be.. a spectre.
Our nature is not a matter for discussion.
We offer you a commission.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
- Our scale of fees...
- The payment will be $3 million.
- No questions asked, I assume.
- No questions answered.
But does the suggested fee represent the difficulty involved?
The client is heavily guarded?
Not guarded at all, but almost certainly impossible to delete with conventional weapons.
We like to know for whom we are working.
We are sure you do.
We need to know your name, or names, in strict client confidentiality, of course.
You may think of us as... the Auditors.
Really?
What do you audit?
Everything.
We maintain the logical order of the universe.
I think we need to know a little more than that.
We are the people with $3 million.
We need to know where, when, and, of course, who.
The location is not on any map and we need the task to be completed by sunrise tomorrow.
This is essential.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
But won't he be out on his rounds?
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!
Is this a joke?
We have no sense of humour.
There are some that say that this... person does not exist.
He must exist!
How else could you so readily recognise his picture?
And many are in correspondence with him.
He would be difficult to find.
You will find persons on any street who can tell you his approximate address.
Yes, of course, but as you say, they can hardly give a map reference.
Even then, how would the...
Fat Man be inhumed?
A glass of poisoned sherry, perhaps?
You misunderstand the nature of employment.
How do I misunderstand you exactly?
We pay, you find the ways and means.
- How can I contact you?
- We will contact you.
We know where you are.
We know... where everyone is.
- Winvoe?
- Yes, sir?
Is Mr Teatime still in the building?
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up, Tusker.
Up, Snouter!
Giddy up!
Wahey!
Go away.
I don't do that stuff any more.
Yes, Twyla?
I'm afraid of the monster in the cellar, Susan.
- It's going to eat me up.
- What, again?
Ye gods, there's a girl out here with a poker!
What are you doing?
Twyla said she's afraid of the monster in the cellar, Mrs Gaiter.
And you're going to attack it with a poker, eh?
Yes.
- Susan's our governess.
- She beats up monsters with a poker?
Actually, that's a very clever idea.
My daughter gets it into her head there's a monster in the cellar, you go in with a poker and make bashing noises while the child listens,
- and everything's alright.
- Is that what you're doing, Susan?
Yes, Mrs Gaiter.
This I've got to watch.
It's not every day you see monsters beaten up by a girl.
Come on.
Come in, Mr Teatime.
Carter, just put it on the table over there, will you?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll go and fetch another cup directly, sir.
- What?
- For your visitor, sir.
What visitor?
Oh, for when Mr Tea...
Mr Teatime?
It's pronounced...
Teh-ah-tim-eh, sir.
Everyone gets it wrong, sir.
How did you get in here?
Easily.
I got mildly... scorched on the last few feet, of course.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with... animals, sir.
I have a report here that says that you nailed Sir George's dog to the ceiling.
I couldn't have it barking while I was working, sir.
- Some people would have drugged it.
- Oh.
But I definitely fulfilled the contract.
I checked Sir George's breathing with a mirror, as instructed.
Apparently his head was several feet from his body at that point.
That was alright, wasn't it, sir?
It, erm lacked elegance.
I thank you, sir!
I'm always happy to be corrected.
I shall remember that... next time.
It was about the next time that I wished to talk.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
You don't have to worry.
She always wins.
Very well done.
Very p-sychological.
Clever idea, that, bending the poker.
I expect you're not afraid any more, eh, my girl?
No.
No.
Very p-sychological.
Susan says, "Don't get afraid.
Get angry."
Oh, well, er, thank you, Susan.
And now, if you'd all like to come back into the parlour...
I mean, the drawing room...
Dashed convincing, the way she bent the poker like that!
- Have they all gone, Twyla?
- Yes, Susan.
Good.
Mind the tail!
That's what we do to monsters.
Now it's back to bed for you, my girl.
Difficult, sir.
Certainly.
But I have devoted some... time to it, sir.
You mean you've actually sat down and thought out how to inhume the Hogfather?
Why, yes, sir.
And the Soul Cake Duck.
And Death, sir.
They're imaginary creatures.
Makes it a challenge.
I suppose I just see things differently from other people.
We may be able to see the complaint of Sir George's estate against you with regard to his dog rather differently,
and approve your graduation to full membership of the Guild.
Take the dark, sir?
Wear black, sir?
If you agree to undertake... this contract.
With due elegance, of course.
With elegance guaranteed, sir.
Er, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?
You have... actually applied yourself to a study of ways of killing Death?
Only as a hobby, sir.
But then some people might say that he is technically immortal.
Everyone has their weak points, sir.
It's gone six.
He's not coming.
- Let's go.
- Sit down, will you?
Assassins are always fashionably late, because of style, right?
What's this?
You never said anything about him being an assassin.
It's Teatime.
He's paying top rate.
We can wait for top rate.
Teatime?
I've heard he's... mental.
And he's got a funny eye.
What I don't understand is... how long has this place had waiters?
Good evening.
Do have another drink while we wait for the other members of our little... troop.
Susan, there's a monster under my bed again.
Oh!
Ow!
Ow!
That's a wizard.
No, I'm not.
I'm incognito.
Yeah, right.
You're just someone in a pointy hat.
Mr Sideney here is indeed a wizard.
A student, anyway.
This is my brother Banjo.
This is Chickenwire.
I didn't want to come!
Mr Sideney's down on his luck at the moment.
Hence his willingness to join our little venture.
So what's the job?
We don't do jobs.
We perform services.
And the service will earn each of you $10,000.
No one said anything about there being magic in all of this.
Well, I...
Do the voice on it!
- Do the voice on it!
- No!
- Not the voice!
- Hit it on the head with a poker.
- Not the poker!
- This is the friendly warning.
Understand?
Because it's Hogswatch.
What are you, a witch or something?
I'm just... something.
Now, you won't be around here again, will you?
Or we'll put your head under the blanket.
It's got fluffy bunnies on it.
Fluffy bunnies...
No!
Go away and stop bothering me.
That wasn't as much fun as the one last month,
You know, the one when you kicked him in the trousers.
Just go to sleep now.
- Locks.
- We have a locksmith.
- Who?
- Mr Brown.
And you can help me carry this.
It's rather heavy.
What is this?
This is my brother Banjo.
Does it do tricks?
No.
He can lift two men up in each hand, by their necks.
Yeah.
He looks like a volcano.
Really?
Wanna be fashionably late, do you?
I do so hope we're gonna be friends, Mr Medium Dave.
It really hurts to think I might not be among... friends.
And I suppose we might as well make a start.
Hello!
My name's Violet, and I have been your tooth fairy for this evening.
Here, there ain't nothing valuable, you know.
Nothing valuable, only a few bags of t-t-t-t...
Teeth?
I know.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
What's your name, sir?
Ernie.
Yes, Ernie.
Come along, gentlemen.
This is my friend Ernie.
He's gonna be our driver for tonight.
Put her in the back, Banjo.
Mister, I ain't rightly allowed to carry passengers, ya know.
Charlie'd give me a right telling off.
Oh, don't you worry about that.
We're all friends here.
Our mam said no hitting girls.
Only bad boys do that, our mam said.
Shut it!
Ssh!
Ernie here doesn't want to listen to our troubles.
Wh-Wh-Where to, mister?
You know the way, Ernie.
Behind the Unseen University.
Where the students of magic are still hard at work on the night before Hogswatch.
It's just a shame we don't have any radiation shielding, Busar.
You want radiation shielding, Mr Stibbons?
Advice from Hex, Bursar.
As the university won't supply us students with a thaumic particle accelerator, we've started to build our own.
Safety first and all that!
Dean, have you seen the Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic?
I need some urgent advice!
Ask the Chair of Indefinite Studies.
- Er...
Hmm...
- Lecturer in Recent Runes?
Well, you see, it all depends...
I don't know...
In my day, when I was an undergraduate,
I wouldn't have been studying on Hogswatch Night.
It's just not natural.
I'd have been sick twice by now.
Bursar?
- Bursar?
- Hello, Mustrum.
- Dean?
Oh, there you are.
- Archchancellor?
Members of the faculty, I've decided, as a Hogswatch present to myself, to open up the late Archchancellor Weatherwax's old bathroom.
So I don't have to sluice down with you fellas.
It's unhygienic.
You can catch stuff.
'Ere, I can't take you lot through the wall!
Listen, Ernie.
Ern.
You will take us through, or, and I say this with very considerable regret,
I'll have to kill you.
- If I take you through the wall...
- What's the worst that can happen?
You'll lose your job.
Whereas if you don't, you'll die.
Really, Mustrum, I think this is most unwise.
It said in the plans there was a bathroom.
You chaps are all acting as if it was some kind of torture chamber.
A bathroom designed by Bloody Stupid Johnson!
The late Bergholt Stuttley Johnson was the worst inventor in the world, Archchancellor!
Yes!
Well, not everything he made had a horribly fateful flaw.
I mean, think of that thing they use in the kitchen for peeling potatoes, for example.
You mean that thing with the brass plate saying "improved manicure device"?
Well, it's only water.
Even old Johnson can't do much harm with water.
Go to it, lad.
- So?
- Er...
Well, he just chucks it at the wall there
- and it goes "twing".
- Really?
May I try?
Ain't that nice, our Davey?
Yeah.
And then you just drive forward.
Right.
Quick, mind, cos it only stays open for a little while.
Thank you very much, Ernie, very much indeed.
Wasn't he dull?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
The Tooth Fairy?
Hah!
Another childish belief.
- Exactly.
- Very elegant.
- It is.
- You have to start somewhere.
Once you have their little minds in your grip, it's goodbye, Hogfather.
It's him!
- Could I give you a hand?
- Oh, yeah!
Oh!
Here, your fingers aren't half cold, mister.
Sorry.
What did he want to go and do that for, eh?
I did what he said!
He could've killed me.
Yes.
I always keep a nip on me these cold nights.
- Keeps me spirits up.
- Indeed.
How am I gonna explain all this, then, eh?
Sorry?
That was very rude of me.
I wasn't paying attention.
What am I gonna tell people?
Letting some blokes ride off in me cart, neat as you like...
That's gonna be the sack for sure.
There, at least, I have some good news, Ernest.
And then again, I also have some bad news.
So...
I'm dead, then.
Correct.
Now, tell me about these blokes who stole your cart and killed you.
Honestly!
Death gets worse and worse.
He seems to like humans.
So illogical!
But the beauty of the assassin's plan is that he can't interfere.
But Death can go everywhere.
No.
Not... quite... everywhere.
Great job, but you look a right tit wearing these helmets.
Hello.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
What's yours?
Albert, something is not right.
Too right.
This is the Mythological Persons room.
How can one of them die?
Soul Cake Duck.
The Tooth Fairy.
The Hogfather!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, oh, dear!
Albert!
We may not have much time.
Oh, is anybody there?
I don't know what you're expecting me to say, but...
Ssh.
Questions first.
Babble...
later.
Now, Miss Bottler,
I'd like you to think of me... as a friend.
- How we doing, Mr Modo?
- Tanks are filled and I've stoked the boilers, Mr Archchancellor, sir.
You did read the sign on that door, Ridcully?
You mean the sign which said,
"Do not under any circumstances open this door"?
Surely it was sealed up for a reason.
Oh, he only wrote that to keep people out.
That's right.
That's what people do.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Hygiene!
That's the ticket.
I still haven't worked out where all the pipes lead.
Oh, we'll find out, don't you fear.
Man the pumps, Mr Modo, or dwarf 'em, of course, in your case.
She's a tooth fairy, but she's not "the" Tooth Fairy.
Ssh.
Teeth...
What do you expect in the Tooth Fairy's castle?
It gives me the creeps just thinking about it.
You don't have to think.
You just have to do what I said.
- All of 'em?
- Every last one.
- Put 'em in a pile.
- That's millions.
Mr Brown?
I want you to unlock every door you can find.
What's this really all about?
Does he believe in things like the Soul Cake Duck?
The Sandman?
The Tooth Fairy?
Yeah.
Even the Hogfather.
Cos after we're finished here, not even he will.
Onwards, Binky, to the Hogfather's Castle of Bones!
The first Hogswatch off in a thousand years, even if I'm going to have the mother of all hangovers in the mor...
And how can the Hogfather bring presents to everyone at the same time?
Unless there are lots of Hogfathers.
Look, you've always believed in the Hogfather, yes?
- Yes...
- Well, if you don't believe in him,
- he won't come down the chimney.
- It's a very small chimney.
And a very small stocking, if you don't go to sleep.
Ah, yes.
And, erm...
"Ho, ho, ho."
There's a tap in there marked Old Faithful which I think perhaps we might leave alone for now.
This is... a most peculiar Hogswatch.
Any mustard?
They're a treat with mustard.
Apple sauce.
I'm finding the beard a bit of a trial.
Well, at least it's keeping you in the right frame of mind, master.
In character, that sort of thing.
But going down the chimney...
Where's the sense in that?
It's gotta be chimbleys, innit, eh?
A bit like the beard, really.
Do you think these little buggers would be writing to someone who can walk through walls if they knew?
Oh, and that reminds me.
The "ho, ho, ho" could do with some more work, if you don't mind me saying so.
Ho, ho, ho?
No, no, no!
No, you've got to put a bit more life in it, sir.
Er, no offence intended.
You've got to do a big, fat laugh, sir, you know, like...
Ho, ho, ho!
Like that.
See?
You've got to sound like you're pissing brandy and you're crapping plum pudding, sir, if you'll pardon my Klatchian.
Really?
How do you know all this?
Well, I used to be young myself once, sir, surprising as it may seem.
- These teeth give me the creeps.
- Just keep going!
- Why are we piling them all up?
- You don't wanna know.
Quicker all the teeth are in a pile, quick we're out of here with our money.
No one ever laid a punch on Banjo since our mam died.
Tough but fair, your mam.
I recall that time she strangled Glossy Ron with his own leg.
Yeah.
Maybe the both of us could creep up on him and...
Yeah!
I keep thinking about that glass eye watching me.
I keep thinking it can see right in my head!
Don't worry.
He doesn't know what you're thinking.
How do you know?
You're still alive.
These damned eyeballs are hard, aren't they?
They're walnuts, not eyeballs.
I don't want you back in my life.
Understand?
Don't say you haven't been warned!
Warned?
Ah!
Did you check the list?
Couldn't really make head nor tail of it, to tell you the truth.
I don't normally care if they've been naughty or nice.
I can feel belief in the Hogfather fading.
- What's that?
- It looks very bad.
No, no.
It's just where something's been nibbling it.
I mean the situation.
I fear we may be too late.
Oh, well.
Never say die, master.
That's our motto.
I can't say it's ever really been mine.
You'd better watch out.
Because if the Hogfather still comes to town as result of a magical misjudgement on your part, then, you will no longer be my friend, Mr Sideney.
I... understand, sir.
Do you have a lot of friends,
Mr Sideney?
Erm... quite a few, actually.
I don't have many.
Don't seem to have the knack.
On the other hand, I don't seem to have any enemies at all.
Well it's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
That is... very... simple and will make the pile of teeth... very...
Mr Teatime!
... dangerous.
Grandfather, this is Hogswatch.
It's supposed to be jolly, with mistletoe and holly... and other things... ending in "olly".
It's a time when people are meant to feel good about things, and eat until they explode, a time when they want to see all their... relatives.
I mean, it's a time when humans are really human, and they don't want a...
a skeleton at the feast, especially one, I might add, who's wearing a false beard and has got a damn cushion shoved up his robe!
I mean, why?
Albert said it would help me get into the spirit of the thing.
This is a real job, and I was looking forward to a real Hogswatch where normal things happen with normal people in a normal house, and suddenly, the old circus comes to town.
Well, I don't know what's going on, but you can just leave right now.
Albert.
Buggery.
Master?
I'm stuck.
The pixie.
Oh, come along in, do.
If the real Hogfather doesn't turn up soon, there's not going to be enough room for him.
- Oh...
- He won't be joining us.
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons,
I will add then that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
The Hogfather is... unavailable.
- At Hogswatch?
- Yes.
Why?
He is...
Let me see.
There isn't an entirely appropriate human word, so, let's settle for gone.
Yes.
He is gone.
How can the Hogfather be gone?
He's..
Isn't he what you are?
Anth...
Anthropomorphic personification?
Yes.
He has become the spirit of Hogswatch.
And while he's gone, you've taken over.
That's sick.
I see the girl writes in green crayon on pink paper with a mouse in the corner.
The mouse is wearing a dress.
I ought to point out that she decided to do that so that the Hogfather would think she was sweet, including the deliberate bad spelling.
But look, why are you doing...
She says she is five years old.
Seven.
In cynicism, she's about 35.
But why are you doing the...
But she believes in the Hogfather.
She'd believe in anything if there was a dolly in it for her.
But you're not going to leave without telling me...
And what are you doing here, Albert?
I thought you'd die if you ever came back to the world.
Ah, but we are not in the world.
We are in the special congruent reality created for the Hogfather.
Normal rules have to be suspended.
How else could anyone get around the entire world in one night?
That's right.
I'm one of the Hogfather's little helpers, me.
It's official.
I've got the little pointy green hat with the bell and everything.
Have you been good, have you?
Now we must be going.
Happy Hogswatch.
And, er...
Oh, yes.
Ho, ho, ho.
Heh, heh.
It's a nice drop of sherry, this.
You've actually been drinking the actual drink little children leave for the actual Hogfather?
Well, yeah.
Why not?
He won't be drinking any more, will he?
Eh?
Not where he's gone...
How many have you had, may I ask?
Hmm?
Well, I dunno.
I haven't been counting.
One million, eight hundred thousand, seven hundred and six.
And sixty-eight thousand, three hundred and nineteen pork pies.
And one turnip.
Oh, yeah.
Well... it looked pork-pie shaped.
But then, everything does after a while, doesn't it?
Why are you doing this?
I am sorry, I cannot tell you.
Forget you saw me.
It's not your business.
Not my business?
How can you say...
You wanted to be normal.
Good night, granddaughter.
Sleep tight.
I know I shall.
Pardon.
There are a lot of doors.
I hope this is the one.
This isn't the room we're looking for.
Just teeth in here.
Keep going, Mr Brown.
Boo!
Susan will try to find out what this is all about, you know.
Oh, dear.
Especially after you told her not to.
You think so?
Oh, yes.
Dear me!
I still have a lot to learn about humans, don't I?
Oh, I dunno.
Obviously it would be quite wrong to involve a human in all this.
That is why, you will recall,
I clearly forbade her to take an interest.
Yes, yes, you did.
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- Yeah, well, of course, that's a shame, really, because she likes to break 'em, doesn't she?
You might think I've already thought of that, but I couldn't possibly comment.
Oh.
And we have much to do.
We have the Hogfather's promises to keep.
Has he done something to the real Hogfather?
Binky.
Can she be eliminated?
Oh, yes.
She's mostly human.
Oh, good.
Then, can we go back to just concentrating on running the universe, making sure that gravity works and that atoms spin?
Yes, when there's not an atom of belief left in the world.
And the Hogfather is just the beginning.
What are you looking for, Mustrum?
My father always said, when you see a lot of people bathing together, the Verruca Gnome is running around with his little sack.
Modo!
Any sign of the Verruca Gnome down there, old boy?
Welcome home, Susan.
You took your time!
I don't do family reunions.
Sandman.
Soul Cake Duck.
Tooth Fairy.
The Hogfather!
Grandfather, what have you done?
This cushion is still uncomfortable.
You're doing well, master.
Soot in the fireplaces, footprints, swigged sherries sleigh tracks all over the roofs.
No, no.
It's got to work.
You think so?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, here's a little tip, though.
"Ho, ho, ho," will do.
Don't say, "Cower, brief mortals!"
Oh.
Really?
So many chimneys...
It would be so much quicker if I lost the cushion.
Yeah, well I mean, if we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
Er, I mean the Hogfather.
So you've got to look the part, master.
I tell you what'd be really good to boost belief is a public appearance.
Oh, I don't normally do them.
Yeah, but the Hogfather's more of a public figure, master.
I tell you what, one good public appearance would do more good than any amount of letting the kids see you by accident.
Really?
And I know just the place.
Thank you very much indeed.
Everything tickety-boo, McPherson?
- Yes, Mr Crumley.
- Jolly good.
Let's go... sleigh them.
I don't know if you noticed, Albert, but that was a pune,
- or play on words.
- Ho, ho, ho, sir.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
You're frightening the little kiddies!
- Wow, they got tusks!
Cool!
- That one's doing a wee.
It's the Campaign for Equal Heights that have done this, isn't it?
They're out to ruin me!
That's it!
I don't mind the smell of the oranges and the damp trousers, but I ain't putting up with this!
And he's not even doing it right!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
Come on!
Who are you?
You can call me Uncle Heavy.
- You're not a pixie.
- No, I'm a fairy cobbler, mister!
Now, just ssh!
Keep quiet!
And what do you want for Hogswatch, small human?
The autobiographies write down everything that happens to you as it happens.
I know.
I used to live here, remember?
But I can't read this.
The letters are all... odd.
Oh, so I suppose now you'll be wanting my words of occult wisdom.
Ethereal runes.
The Hogfather ain't human, after all.
Er, I suppose a bit of warm liver's out of the question?
~ On the second day of Hogswatch
~ I sent my true love back
~ A nasty little letter
~ And a partridge in a pear tree
What's your game?
Small-time thief, are you?
You ain't supposed to be able to see me.
I'm a wizard!
We can see things that are really there, you know.
Oh, what's in this bag?
You'll really wish you hadn't, mister.
Oh, will I?
What are you doing here, young man?
Well, you know the Tooth Fairy?
Well, it's sort of like the same business.
- You take things away?
- Not take away as such...
More sort of bring.
- Ah.
Right, new teeth.
- Like new verrucas.
Oh, you're him.
I saw your piggy do a wee.
Oh?
Well... good.
It had a great big...
- What do you want for Hogswatch?
- She wants...
I want an army and a big castle with an active drawbridge and a sword.
I think they're supposed to say thank you.
Are you sure?
People don't normally.
No, I meant to the Hogfather, which is you!
Right?
- Sorry.
- Yes, of course.
You're supposed to say thank you.
Thank you.
And be good.
This is part of the arrangement.
- Yes.
- Then, we have a contract.
- Ah, verrucas, eh?
- Wish I knew why.
- Do you mean you don't know?
- No!
Suddenly I wake up and I'm the Verruca Gnome!
Why, how strange!
Anyway... amazing bathroom, isn't it?
It's even got a special pot for your toenail clippings.
- Special pot for your toenail clippings?
- Well, you can't be too careful.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clippings, hair, teeth, you've got them under your control.
I mean, that's real old magic.
Children of the world, prepare to think as you are told.
Mr Sideney?
Your big... no-misjudgements magic moment.
You can't give her that!
It's not safe!
It's a sword.
They're not meant to be safe.
- But she's a child!
- It's educational.
What if she cuts herself?
That will be an important lesson.
Really?
Oh, well.
It's not for me to argue, I suppose.
And she doesn't want all that other stuff.
She's a girl!
And anyway, I can't afford big posh stuff like that.
I thought I gave it away.
- You do?
- You do?
You don't!
That's our merchandise!
You don't just give it away.
Hogswatch isn't about giving everything away.
I mean, yes, you do give things away, but you have to buy them first.
You mean... this is all... free?
It... would seem... to be.
So, Mr Stibbons, this thing's a great big artificial brain, then, eh?
You could think of it like that.
Of course, Hex doesn't actually think, not as such.
- It just appears to be thinking.
- Amazing!
You mean it gives the impression of thinking, but really it's just a show?
- Er, yes.
- Just like everyone else, then, eh?
Oh, I knew I came here for something.
Now, this little chappie is the Verruca Gnome who's just popped into existence to be with us on Hogswatch Night, being the most magical night of the year.
Last year's occult rubbish piling up...
I thought you chaps might like to check up on it.
The Verruca Gnome?
Well, it makes about as much sense as anything else, doesn't it?
After all, there's a Tooth Fairy, isn't there?
Makes one wonder why there's a god of wine and not a god of hangovers.
Anyone hear a noise just then?
Sorry, Archchancellor?
A sort of...
Like a lot of, er... tinkling bells?
I didn't hear anything like that, sir.
Oh.
Well, where was I?
Erm...
Oh yes, well, I mean, nobody's ever seen a Verruca Gnome until tonight.
I've never heard of me until tonight, and I am me!
Well, erm, we'll see what Hex can find out, Archchancellor.
Good man.
Amazing!
Now we should be able to get to the bottom of all this.
None of this is right.
Everyone knows he's just a jolly old fat man who hands out presents to kids.
He wasn't always so jolly.
- You know how it is.
- Do I?
Well, it's like, you know, industrial retraining.
Even gods have to move with the times.
You see, your Hogfather was probably just your basic winter demiurge, you know, blood on the snow, making the sun come up...
So there has to be blood to make the sun come up?
Hmm!
Well, it starts off with animal sacrifice,
You know, hunt some big, hairy animal to death, that kind of stuff, very folkloric, very... mythic.
Didn't stop at animals, neither.
They had sacred kings, the strongest and the best, died at the dark time of year to give life to the unconquered sun.
And in a way, the Hogfather was all of 'em.
- And then?
- Then some bright spark thought,
"Aye, looks like that damn sun comes up anyway, so how come we're giving those Druids all this free grub?"
The world moves on, and he's gotta find a new job.
So he started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up?
Exactimundo.
And now he gives out presents.
Top of the evenin', squire.
I am Corporal Nobbs of the Watch, and this is Constable Visit, sir.
I want you to arrest him!
- Arrest who, sir?
- The Hogfather!
What for, sir?
He's sitting up there as bold as brass in his... grotto giving away presents!
Not quite up to speed here, sir.
I thought the Hogfather was supposed to give away stuff, isn't he?
But this one's... an impostor!
You know, I always thought that.
I thought, the Hogfather spends two weeks sitting in a wooden grotto in some shop in Ankh-Morpork, very busy time, too.
Nice life, eh?
He's not the Hogfather we usually have!
You mean a different impostor?
Not the real impostor at all?
Yes!
No!
Arrest the Hogfather style of thing?
- Yes!
- On Hogswatch Night?
- Yes.
- For giving away presents?
In front of all these kiddies?
Yes!
- In your shop?
- Y...
You think... that might look a bit... bad?
Difficult to see how it could look good, sir.
Could you not do it... surreptitiously?
Oh, well!
Yes.
Surreptition.
Yes.
We could give that a try.
You won't find me ungrateful.
In Omnia, we call Hogswatch Night the Fast of St Ossory.
But it is not an occasion for superstition and crass commercialism.
I used to hang up my stocking every Hogswatch, regular.
All that ever happened was my dad was sick in it once.
I'm going in.
There seems to be a thaumic surge from somewhere.
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
It's the expression on their little faces I like.
Yeah, a sort of cross between fear and and awe.
They don't know whether to laugh, cry or wet their pants.
Yes.
Now, that is what I call belief.
Next.
And what's your name, little person?
Nobby Nobbs, Hogfather.
And have you been a good bo?
A good dwa?
A good gno?
A good individual?
Yes.
So why isn't it working?
Ah, the chalk... just got a bit scuffed, you know, when we were piling up the... the things.
- You're sure that's what it is?
- Well, er...
What about the spell?
Oh, that'll go on forever.
Simple ones do.
It's just a state change, powered by the... the...
It just keeps going.
That's very good, Mr Sideney.
Because if the sympathetic magic doesn't work, you will find me very unsympathetic.
What happened?
What happened?
Ah, it's disgusting, this whole business!
It is the worship of idols!
It's a genuine Burleigh Stronginthearm double-action triple-cantilever crossbow with a polished-walnut stock and... silver engraved facings.
Aren't we going to arrest the impostor, Corporal?
You're foreign, Washpot.
I can't expect you to know the real meaning of Hogswatch.
On the whole, I think that went very well, don't you?
Yes, master.
And I think I've got the laugh working really well now.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Yes, sir.
Very jolly.
Tomorrow morning, they'll believe, alright.
They'd better.
Because if they don't, then there won't be a tomorrow morning.
So for the sun to come up tomorrow, the Hogfather has to be alive.
Precise-amente.
But what if he's dead?
And this was gonna be your big... moment.
It's him!
Such a shame!
Pretty lights...
Think... happy, Banjo.
Wake up!
Wake up!
You've got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
You're not the Hogfather.
There must be thousands here.
What's all this stuff?
It's just paper.
They're title deeds to properties, and they're better than money.
So if we steal them, do they become ours?
Is that a trick question?
Anyway, let's get going.
He won't miss a few, er...
- Gentlemen.
- We were just, er...
We were just... piling up the stuff.
Hah!
Hmm!
I know people say
I'd kill them as soon as look at them.
And in fact, I'd much rather kill you than look at you, Mr Lilywhite.
You're thinking that Banjo's gonna help you.
That's how its always been, isn't it?
But Banjo's my friend now.
Banjo has the heart...
of a little child.
And believe, I have, too.
Help him, Banjo.
As far as this goes, I really have no use for it.
It's only pillow money.
Something much more...
interesting has become apparent.
Albert...
I don't see the Hogfather as someone who rolls his own.
Drop him.
Control.
Control the inner child, and it'll even give you its teeth.
And somewhere in this tower, you're gonna help me find someone who can use it who can use it to... give me the world.
So, is he saying to take the money and go?
Don't be so bloody stupid!
Daddy?
I say...
It's not what you think!
Yes, it is.
Mr Brown?
There's one door you haven't found.
Find the Tooth Fairy's secret room.
And when he does then, just think what I can make the kiddiewinks think.
- Are you alright?
- I wish I was dead.
I think you may have come to the right place.
- Oh, my head...
- Are you the Hogfather?
I feel awful!
Have you got any ice?
Duty calls.
Yeah, but which one?
That one or this one?
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
Everything starts somewhere although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where.
Where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that, the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle, the great A'Tuin.
It was some time after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories of the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis.
"Things just happen.
What the hell?"
Our story began in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld, a city where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for Wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets below.
Our story continues in the middle of the night before Hogswatch, a midwinter festival, which, for some reason, bears a remarkable similarity to your Christmas, that now takes us to the Tooth Fairy's castle,
where magic has made children's teeth perilously powerful, so that our story is much sooner rather than later about blood.
Mr Teatime!
There you are.
I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
I'm not telling you anything.
Who are you, anyway?
I'm glad you asked.
I'm your worst nightmare.
Oh.
You mean the one with the giant cabbage and the, kind of, whirling-knife thing?
Sorry, no.
Not that one.
I'm the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you, stone dead.
Oh, that one.
But that's not...
Rather a charitable act there, I feel.
But it is nearly Hogswatch after all.
Bring me the girl.
Odd.
Oh.
It's a scythe job, then.
They took the teeth.
All of them.
They just walked in and they... they...
No!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
- Where did he come from?
- A place I cannot go.
Well, even if you could go there, we've got our work cut out here keeping the Hogfather's seat warm.
If what's happening in the Tooth Fairy's castle isn't stopped, then, everything we've been doing is a waste of time.
And if they get to the Tooth Fairy, they will be able to control all human belief.
Unless Susan gets there first.
Yes, well, it's coming along well.
Very impressive.
Well done.
- I need your help, Mr Ridcully.
- You...
You're...
Yes.
The scythe, the cloak, the white horse, the granddaughter.
I need you to wake him up.
His name's Bilious.
He's the Oh God of Hangovers.
Something nasty's happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is but he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you brought him here?
Why are you doing this?
- I mean, I was a bit behind with the teeth, I know...
- Is she behind this door?
I don't know.
There was nearly $13
- in pillow money owing, I admit.
- This her door?
But I signed the form G...
Will you just shut up and answer the question?
I don't know.
I've never been here before.
Then your boss probably doesn't realise how irritating you are.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Or Miss Bottler gets it.
It was only a bit of loose change!
And I really, I was going to... 10 Scrote...
Have you got the list?
This is really, really stupid.
I think the tradition got started when everybody had them big chimbleys, master.
Indeed.
It's only a mercy it's unlit.
The boy wants a pair of trousers that he doesn't have to share, a huge meat pie, a sugar mouse,
a lot of toys and a puppy called Scruff.
Aw, how sweet.
I shall wipe away a tear.
Cos what he's getting, you see, is this little wooden toy
- and an apple.
- But the letter clearly...
I know.
It's the socioeconomic factors.
I mean, the world would be in a hell of a mess, wouldn't it, if everybody got what they asked for?
I gave them what they wanted in the store.
Yeah, well, what good is a god that gives you everything that you want, eh?
- You have me there.
- Ah, yeah.
No, it's the hope that's important.
Oh, yes.
It's a big part of belief, is the hope.
I mean, say you give people jam today and they'll just sit there and eat it, won't they.
But jam tomorrow?
Ah, no.
That'll keep 'em going forever.
And you mean that because of this, the poor get poor things and the rich get rich things?
Well, yeah.
That's the meaning of Hogswatch, innit, master?
But I'm the Hogfather!
At the moment, I mean.
Well, it makes no difference.
I remember when I was a nipper.
It was one Hogswatch, it was and I had my heart set on this huge model horse in this shop.
It was what I always wanted.
Someone was in there, buying it, and, do you know, just for a second,
I thought it really was going to be for me.
But it wasn't.
I spent hours with me nose pressed up against the window, till someone heard me calling and unfroze me.
Yes, I would've killed for that horse.
But you know what?
I still hung up my stocking on Hogswatch Eve.
And do you know why?
Cos I had hope!
Yeah.
And the next morning, our dad had put in my stocking a little wooden horse that he had carved his very own self.
Ah, and that was worth more than all the expensive toy horses in the world?
No, cos you're a selfish little bugger when you're only seven.
It's only grown-ups that think like that.
This is wrong.
It is... unfair.
Well, that's life, innit, master, eh?
But I'm not.
This is supposed to be the season to be jolly.
- Hmm.
- And other things ending in "olly".
Please.
Just take her out of vocal range.
Mr Brown.
Your big moment.
Break me out the real Tooth Fairy.
Oh, come along, lad.
If you're the Lecturer in Recent Runes, can't you do something more, well, magical?
Well, Spold's Unstirring Divisor would do it.
You would end up with a large beaker filled with all the nastiness.
It's not difficult at all, if you don't mind the side effects.
Tell me about the side effects.
The main one is that the rest of him would end up in a somewhat larger beaker.
- Alive?
- Well, broadly, yes.
Living tissue, certainly.
And definitely sober.
Why don't we just mix up absolutely everything and see what happens?
It's got to be worth a try.
Ah.
Thank you, my dear.
A-ha!
Is this going to take much longer?
We may not have much time.
Oh, you can't be too careful.
- What's that?
- Ssh.
Wow-Wow sauce.
The hottest sauce in the universe.
And it'll blow your head clean off.
It's not safe to drink it if the sweat is still condensing on the bottle.
On the other hand, if it is a kill-or-cure remedy, then, we are, given the possibility that the patient is immortal probably onto a winner.
I wonder if it's gone critical yet.
I don't know.
I wish you fellas would show some backbone.
Careful, Archchancellor!
What you have there may represent pure sobriety.
I'll try it.
You did say he was immortal, didn't you?
- And you mean... he just appeared?
- Yes!
He has no memory of existing before appearing at the Hogfather's castle.
You mean, like this fellow?
Don't be ridiculous.
Gods and gnomes don't appear en masse for no reason.
Bring me, let's see,
20 pints of lager, some pepper vodka and bottle of coffee liqueur.
I didn't have you sobered up just so you could go on a binge.
- You don't drink.
- I don't?
Oh.
Yeah.
- I need you to help me.
- Oh.
I'm afraid I did it, didn't I?
I, erm, I said something to young Stibbons about drinking and hangovers, didn't I?
You mean you created it just like that?
Oh, I find that very hard to believe, Mustrum.
Good job nobody mentioned the Hair Loss Fairy, then!
I am not losing my hair.
It is just very finely spaced.
Yes, half on your head and half on your hairbrush.
For the last time, I am not...
I wish I knew where that was coming from.
We need a bigger brain for this.
That thinking engine of yours working, Ponder?
Er, Hex is resting, Archchancellor.
Can you hear me in there?
You don't have to shout, Archchancellor.
What is that "ning-ning, ning-ning, ning-ning" noise all about?
It says, "Look at the Dean."
"Look at the...
Dean."
Is there a problem?
- Are you the Hair Loss Fairy?
- Apparently.
What have you been doing with my hair?
Just a minute.
Where exactly were you before I found you in the snow?
Anywhere where drink had been consumed in beastly quantities sometime previously, you could say.
A-ha...
- So you were an imminent vital force, aye?
- Oh, sounds great!
What is that?
So, when we joked about the Hair Loss Fairy, it suddenly focused on the Dean's head.
You're calling things into being.
I personally have always wondered if there was an Eater of Socks.
You know how there's always one missing?
Ah!
To the laundry!
Tell me again who these people are.
Some of the cleverest men in the world.
And I'm sober, am I?
What is that ridiculous thing on your head?
I don't know, sir!
What?
What is it?
It says here...
"If found, please return to the Tooth Fairy's castle."
Well, thank goodness the Tooth Fairy already exists, hey?
Tooth Fairy?
Oh, you see her around a lot these days.
Or them, rather.
It's a sort of franchise operation to collect children's teeth in exchange for money.
And she has a castle.
She sounds great.
Actually, I do remember one thing.
When I appeared at the Hogfather's house, there was this drunken little fellow in a pointy hat.
I thought it was just the drink talking, but he did mention something about the permanent end of perpetual servitude for the little helpers of all fantasy personifications!
Including the Tooth Fairy.
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
Where did you find this?
Is he alright?
I say, what is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's castle?
- Now I'm feeling normal, can I come with you?
- This is not a normal situation.
Look, I think I'd better tell you.
- My grandfather is Death.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Death.
You know, death.
The robes, the scythe, the white horse, bones.
Death.
But at the moment, he's acting rather strange.
I just want to make sure I've got this clear.
You think your grandfather is Death and you think he's acting strange?
Look, Death adopted my mother.
He then took on a human apprentice.
They fell in love and I'm the result.
This is fascinating.
Let's just say I picked up a few strange genetic knacks along the way.
- Now, that looks dangerous.
- I hope so.
- Wait!
I could help you!
- Would you be any good in a fight?
Yes, I could be sick on people.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Whoa!
- There he is!
Watch yourselves!
- We have to sort this out.
We can't have creatures popping into existence just because people are talking about them.
Unhygienic.
So, what is this implied creation, then?
"Humans have always ascribed random, seasonal, natural or inexplicable actions to human-shaped entities."
"Such examples are the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy and Death."
Well, that's all very well, but I'm damn sure there's never been an Eater of Socks or an Oh God of Hangovers.
I think it works like this.
What we're getting is the personification of forces,
- just like Hex said.
- A bit like the Hogfather?
Wa..wa..wa..wa..when you're a kiddie, it's a it's as good an explanation as any as where presents come from.
But why is it happening now?
"Beliefs causing new creatures to appear."
You could put it like that.
"There's a finite quantity of belief in the universe."
Well, certainly people can only believe in so many things.
"It follows that if a major focus of belief is removed, there will be spare belief."
Alright, then....
What are people not believing in all of a sudden?
"Out of cheese....... error."
"Melon.
Melon.
Melon."
"Redo from start."
It's Hogswatch.
I suppose the Hogfather is around, isn't he?
I like this job.
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
Excuse me.
Yes.
This will show them.
But Poor Little Match Girl dying in the snow is all part of the spirit of Hogswatch, master.
You see, people hear about it and they say,
"We might be as poor as a disabled banana and only can afford to eat mud and boots, but see how much better off we are than the Poor Little Match Girl!"
That makes them happy and grateful for what they have got.
I know what the spirit of Hogswatch is, Albert.
You're not allowed to do that.
The Hogfather can.
The Hogfather gives presents.
There's no better present than a future.
That's it.
I've had enough of this pixie lark.
I'm waiting for the Hogfather.
I'm in the dark, waiting for the Hogfather.
Me.
A believer in natural philosophy.
I can find the square root of 27.4 in my head.
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's not as if I've hung a stocking up.
.... be some point if...
Take her somewhere warm and give her a good dinner.
And I may well be checking up later.
Looks like we've been chosen to do a bit of charity.
Well, I don't call it very charitable, just dumping someone on people like this.
I dunno.
Some people wouldn't know the real meaning of Hogswatch if it jumped up and clocked 'em in the gob.
No!
This is a child's painting.
Twyla paints like that.
I painted like that.
Grandfather saved some of my draw...
Come on.
Let's find the house.
- What house?
- There's always a house.
I was told you were the best locksmith in the city.
Yes, but locks don't generally alter themselves while you're working on them, that's what I'm saying.
Are you the best or not?
No!
Not the dark!
Banjo.
I'm getting out of here.
There's something wrong with this place.
I made a big pile.
Do you want to come with me?
It's pretty here.
Mr Sideney.
Would he deliver to apes earlier than to humans?
Interesting point, sir.
Possibly you're referring to my theory that humans may have descended from apes.
A bold hypothesis, which, if the Grants Committee could just see their way clear to letting me hire a boat and sail around to the islands...
I just thought he might deliver alphabetically.
Let me see, now.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Hogfather, of course.
Erm... ho, ho, ho.
You look extremely thin in the face.
I...
I'm, er...
I'm a bit ill.
Oh.
- Terminally, I would say.
- Yeah.
A-ha!
It's a false beard.
- No, it's not.
- It's got hooks for the ears.
That must've given you a spot of trouble there.
A pillow!
I thought there were seven locks.
Yeah, but they're half magic, half real and half not there.
Then there's parts of 'em don't exist half the time.
And I thought you could open any lock anyone ever made.
Made by humans and most dwarves.
I dunno what made these.
You never said anything about magic...
That's a shame.
Then, really, I have no more need of your services.
- You may as well go back home.
- What about my money?
Of course.
You should get what you deserve.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr Tea Cup.
I'm leaving, right, with what's coming to me and you ain't stopping me.
Banjo certainly ain't.
I knew his old ma in the good old days.
You think you're nasty?
You think you're mean?
Ma Lilywhite'd tear your ears off and spit 'em in your eyes.
Cocky little devil.
I remember you when you was little, Banjo.
- I used to sit you on my knees.
- Banjo...
There you are.
Where's all these shadows coming from?
It's giving me the creeps!
And it's all your fault.
Oh, yeah?
So it wasn't you who said, "Wow. $10,000.
Count me in!"
Yeah, but I didn't know there was gonna be all this creepy stuff!
I wanna go home.
It's like dealing with a child!
Poor guy must have slipped.
Yeah.
Slipped.
That's the Tooth Fairy's castle?
- It's teeth.
- And I should be scared?
There's nothing that scary about teeth.
Did I say I was scared?
I must just be hungover again.
- Oh, no.
- They're only teeth.
Oi!
- Surely no one would try to...
- What is that?
It's such old magic, it isn't even magic any more.
If you've got a piece of someone's hair, nail clipping or tooth, you can control them.
Don't tell me someone's...
- What's that shadow?
- This place is alive.
And it's protecting itself.
So, what happened to the other fellow?
Well the Hogfather has enemies.
What did he do, miss a chimney?
There's, er, there's people down there, Mr Teatime.
Well, just do away with them.
Well, er, one of them's a girl.
Then, do away with them... politely.
Keep going.
Quicker.
It's after me!
Let me out!
- What was that?
- It's finding their nightmares.
Let me out!
It's after me!
Pull yourself together.
Look around.
There's nothing chasing you.
I thought it was the... wardrobe.
What wardrobe?
When I was a kid, we had this big... wardrobe.
And it had this... this...
On the door, it had this face!
And at night, it whispered things.
Who's that moving up there?
I think they saw us.
And if they're tooth fairies, there's been a really stupid equal-opportunities policy.
Right.
You go that way, I'll go this way.
- Why don't we stay together?
- What's got into you?
Hmm?
This is a children's place.
The rules are what children believe.
- Well, that's a relief.
- You think so?
It's impossible to die here.
My grandfather doesn't figure in a child's world.
That man who fell down the stairs looked pretty dead to me.
Oh, you die.
But not here.
You...
Let's see.
Yes.
You go somewhere else.
Away.
- Aren't you Susan?
- Yes.
And when you came for Twyla's last tooth, you were so shocked that I could see you.
- Oh, yes, and I saw...
- Look, we may not have a lot of time.
Is this... the Tooth Fairy?
A tooth fairy.
Do you... drink at all?
No, I don't.
Not touch alcohol at all?
Never.
My dad's very strict about that sort of thing.
Nice castle.
Can we get on?
Good.
Who brought you here, Violet?
I don't know...
Oh, but he's dressed like an assassin!
OK.
You two stay here.
I'll go find him.
And I'll look after Violet.
That's the fourth lock open.
I commend your expertise.
And the others?
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh?
Logically, if you're the guardian of children's beliefs and this is your castle and I come across as securely locked a door as this then, not to thoroughly investigate would lack elegance.
What's that sound?
- What sound?
- That sound.
Like old scissors scraping.
Have you ever heard of the Auditors?
Well, I suppose that the Bursar might have done.
Not auditors of money.
Auditors of reality.
They are the civil service of everything.
And they want to get rid of us?
They want humans to be...
less creative.
The Hogfather is a symbol of this.
Strange thinking.
They hate the way humans make up stories about the universe.
I can't think why.
And you, why are you doing this job?
Someone must.
It is vitally important.
Before dawn, there must be enough belief in the Hogfather.
- Why?
- So that the sun will come up.
I seldom joke.
What sort of godding do you do?
Oh, I'm the, er, I'm the Oh God of Hangovers.
- A god of hangovers?
Oh, how awful.
- I suppose so.
You're more cut out to be one of those important gods.
- Oh!
- What's this, eh?
Lovers' Lane?
You leave him alone, you!
He's a god!
Dear me!
Out of thunderbolts, are we?
Well, you know, I've never killed a g...
What's the matter?
It's just a wardrobe, innit?
I don't want to see!
I don't want to see.
Hex was right, Archchancellor.
Hex?
Who is Hex?
Erm, he's the biggest thinker in the world.
I would like to meet this Mr Hex.
Quite a large thaumic reading, gentlemen.
I think he got here by magic.
Where did he go?
They say you are the biggest thinker in the world, but do you also believe?
Extend logically the result of the human race ceasing to believe in the Hogfather.
Will the sun come up?
Answer.
Correct.
How may this be prevented?
Answer.
"Regular and consistent belief."
Good.
I have a task for you, thinking engine.
Believe in the Hogfather.
Do you believe?
Answer.
Do you believe?
Answer!
Good.
Hmm.
Oh, no!
Let me see.
How old are you?
And have you been naughty or nice?
Hello.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
Bone handle.
Rather tasteless skull-and-bone decoration.
Death himself's second-favourite weapon.
Am I right?
Oh, my.
It must be Hogswatch.
This must mean that you are Susan.
The famous granddaughter.
Nobility.
I'd bow, but I'm afraid you'd do something dreadful.
Yes!
Yes!
Left-handed using a wooden pick.
It's so simple!
Ah!
Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh, I've managed to open the fifth lock.
No problem.
They're just based on Woddeley's Occult Sequence.
- How do you know who I am?
- Easy.
Twurp's Peerage.
Family motto, non timetis messor.
Your father was well known.
Went a long way very fast.
As for your grandfather, honestly, that motto, "fear not the reaper", is that good taste?
Course, you don't need to fear him, do you?
Or do you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who are you, anyway?
I beg your pardon.
My name's Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Jonathan Teh-ah-tim-eh at your service.
You mean...
like around four o'clock in the afternoon?
No.
I did say...
Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Please don't try to break my concentration by annoying me.
- How are you getting on, Mr Sideney?
- Oh!
Er...
It's just according to Woddeley's Sequence, number six should be copper and blue-green light.
Do you think your grandfather will try to rescue you?
But now I have his sword.
You see, I wonder...
All fingers and thumbs, Mr Sideney.
Er, I've managed to open the sixth lock, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Really?
But it may not be all-important now.
Thank you, anyway.
You've been most helpful.
- Erm...
- Yes.
You may go.
Is that all you're here for?
A robbery, like a petty thief?
A thief?
Me?
I'm not a thief, madam.
No.
These gentlemen are thieves.
That's Medium Dave.
And Exhibit B is Banjo.
He can talk.
Oh!
Who are you?
I'm incognito.
You look like a wizard to me.
Did you suck your thumb when you were little?
Nope!
- Is that the Scissor Man?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Kids believe all kinds of crap, but I'm a grown-up now, so...
No more Hogfather.
And that's only the start.
I'll be able to make people believe anything I want.
What's this?
You said, "No more Hogfather."
He does know what we've been doing here, doesn't he?
You did tell him?
There's gotta be a Hogfather.
There's always a Hogfather.
- She did it!
She killed him.
- No, I didn't.
He...
- Did!
- Didn't.
- Did.
- What's this about the Hogfather?
I don't think he's dead, but Teatime has made him very ill.
Who cares?
When this is over, Banjo, you'll have as many presents as you want.
Trust me.
There has to be a Hogfather, else there's no Hogswatch.
- It's just another solar festival.
- Banjo and me are going.
Banjo, you're coming with me right now.
Grab her, Banjo.
It's all her fault.
Our mam said no hitting girls.
No touching them or pulling them hair.
She's not a girl.
She's a freak.
I think I know you, Teatime.
You're the mad kid they're all scared of, right?
- Banjo, I said grab her.
- Our mam said...
The kid who didn't know the difference between chucking a stone at a cat and setting it on fire.
I said shut up.
Get her, Banjo.
The kind of little boy who looks up dolls' dresses.
- I didn't.
- Our mam said...
Ah, to blazes with your mam!
What did you say about our mam?
I bet no one wanted to play with you.
- Not the kid with no friends.
- Banjo, you do as I tell you.
Our mam...
Our mam...
Our mam said...
Have you been a bad boy, Banjo?
You been letting him get into trouble again, our Davey?
You have, haven't ya?
No, Mam.
No, Mam!
You need a good hiding, Banjo.
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, Mam!
You been playing with girls again?
Sorry!
Sorry!
Sorry, Mam!
Sorry, Mam!
Sorry!
No, Mam.
No, Mam!
No!
...
No!
Oh, no.
I don't think so.
This place gets into your head, doesn't it?
It... finds out how to deal with you.
But I'm in touch with my inner child.
It's so much fun.
No pulling girls' hair.
That's bad.
I'm gonna have so much fun with this.
So light.
You wouldn't dare use it!
My grandfather will come after you.
- He comes after everyone.
- He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
It doesn't work here.
There's no death here.
Hi, inner child.
I'm the inner baby-sitter.
Happy Hogswatch!
Is.. is.. he dead?
He's not breathing.
Breathing spell.
Breathing spell.
Spolt's forthright respirator, perhaps.
I think I've got it written down somewhere.
Come on, chaps.
Give me some space.
Excuse me... excuse me, but this is vitally important for the advancement of natural philosophy.
Did you see any bright lights?
Was there a shining tunnel?
What is all this, Mr Stibbons?
Put the damn quill away.
This must be the Unseen University.
And you're all... wizards.
There was a sword.
Oh, yes.
It's, er, fallen on the floor.
Did I do that?
I really must be off.
Well, he won't get far.
The main doors are locked, in accordance with Archchancellor Spold's rules.
- Won't get far?
- No!
While holding a sword which appears to be able to cut through anything?
You can get into trouble, hitting girls.
No playing with girls.
What am I gonna do now?
Hello, my dear.
No.
Sorry, dear?
You're not the Tooth Fairy.
Oh, I am, dear.
Oh, Grandma, what big teeth you have.
You've even got a shawl.
Oh, dear.
I don't understand, lovey.
You forgot the rocking chair.
I always thought there'd be a rocking chair.
I don't think you're real.
It's not a little old woman in a shawl running this place.
You're out of my head.
That's how you defend yourself.
You poke around in people's heads and find the things that work...
No.
It's horrible, but it doesn't frighten me.
I like spiders.
Dogs?
No.
I like rats.
Rats are fine.
Sorry, is anyone frightened of that?
I...
I...
You're a bogeyman, aren't you?
Not a.
The!
The first bogeyman.
- You look terrible.
- Thank you very much.
I mean ill.
I used to jump out on them and say, "Boo!" Yeah.
But then I got to like 'em.
Only children were frightened of me.
I mean, what's to be scared of?
Horns, bony arms.
But then I discovered that there were much worse things than me and I wanted to protect the children, keep them safe from all the really bad things.
So I built all this to be a safe place.
And the teeth?
If you leave all those teeth around,
- anything could happen.
- Anything nearly did.
So, you are the Tooth Fairy, then?
Yes!
I... ah..
Oh...
Then.. they came, stealing.
I'm too weak to look after them any more.
You don't die here.
Just get old.
Listening to the laughter.
Don't worry about the teeth.
I'll make them safe again.
I think it would be a good idea if you did the Tooth Fairy's job, Banjo.
Do...
Do you think that'd be alright?
Won't the Tooth Fairy mind?
You... do it until she comes back.
So.... who's gonna tell me what to do?
No one's ever going to tell you what to do again, Banjo.
Thanks, miss.
I'll keep the teeth safe.
- Er, miss?
- Yes, Banjo?
Can I have a puppy?
I had a kitten, but our mam drownded it cos it was dirty.
I think it'll turn up quite soon, Banjo.
Thanks, miss.
Billy!
Violet's talked about it and we thought we ought to come back and help.
- It's OK.
They're all gone.
- Oh.
And Banjo needed a new job.
That's funny.
So does Billy.
Look, why don't you two make yourselves useful and help Banjo clear up this mess?
He's pretty much running the place now.
- Oh, but he's...
- He's in charge.
We'd love to help, Banjo.
Together.
Good.
Have fun.
Now I'm going home.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
Grandfather!
What are you doing here?
It is not over.
You must bring the Hogfather home.
These look like the mountains where the Castle of Bones was.
They are.
- It's a pig!
- A boar.
This boar is the?
Yes.
The Hogfather as he began.
- And the dogs.
- These are not real dogs.
If they catch him, he won't just die.
He will... never be.
Well, stop them.
This is a human thing.
The Auditors are desperate now.
They're determined to destroy the Hogfather at whatever cost.
You must save him.
Come on.
Jump.
Just you try it.
Yes!
Who wants some?
Anyone else?
Ho, ho, ho.
You couldn't resist it in the end.
A mistake, I fancy.
It gets under your skin, life.
Speaking metaphorically, of course.
And, you see, the more you struggle for every moment, the more alive you stay.
Which is where I come in, as a matter of fact.
You can't do this.
There are rules.
Yes, there are rules.
But you broke them.
How dare you.
How dare you!
And now there remains only one final question.
Have you been naughty or nice?
Ho, ho, ho.
We saved you.
Dying's not how it's supposed to go!
Er...
Er, sorry.
Hyah!
Well that about wraps it up for this dress.
I'd just like to ask, purely out of academic interest, you were sure I was going to survive, were you?
I was quite confident.
Good.
Now, tell me...
What would've happened if you hadn't saved him?
- Yes.
- The sun would not have risen.
Then what would've happened?
A mere ball of flaming gas would have illuminated the world.
Alright, I'm not stupid.
You're saying that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.
No.
Humans need fantasy to be human.
To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.
With tooth fairies, Hogfathers...
Yes.
As practice, you have to start out learning to believe the little lies.
- So we can believe the big ones?
- Yes.
Justice, mercy, duty, that sort of thing.
- They're not the same at all.
- You think so?
Then, take the universe and grind it down to the finest powder and sieve it through the finest sieve, and then show me one atom of justice, one molecule of mercy.
And yet, you try to act as if there is some ideal order in the world, as if there is some... some rightness in the universe by which it may be judged.
But people have got to believe that, or what's the point?
You need to believe in things that aren't true.
How else can they become?
Er, would you like to visit for Hogswatch dinner?
Albert is frying a pudding.
I, er...
Well, they're really expecting me here.
Would you like a drink before you go?
A cup of cocoa would be appropriate in the circumstances.
Right.
There are biscuits in the tin on the mantelpiece.
- Susan's got a poker, you know.
- My goodness me.
I thought all of you knew that by now.
Indeed.
Last week, she picked a bogey up by its nose.
I'll give Gawain his stocking, then I'll come and watch.
Susan...
Well, well.
Now, this is... unexpected.
A family affair.
I wonder...
Is it possible to kill... death?
Hmm!
This must be a very special sword.
And it certainly works here.
And, of course, it might well not be regarded as murder.
Possibly it is... a civic act.
It would be, as they say the big one.
You may have some personal knowledge about your vulnerability, but I'm pretty certain that Susan here will quite definitely die.
So I'd rather you didn't try any last-minute stuff.
I am last-minute stuff.
I don't remember them asking for anything that made a noise.
Oh, there has to be something in the stocking that makes a noise.
Otherwise, what is 4:30am for?
There are children?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
- Call them.
- Certainly not.
It'll be instructive.
Educational.
And when your adversary is Death, you can't help but be the good guy.
Call them.
Gawain.
Twyla.
Come in.
Come in!
Curly haired tots!
I caught this bogeyman.
What shall we do with him, huh?
It's only a skeleton!
Yes.
A nasty, creepy, horrible skeleton.
Scary, huh?
He's eating a biscuit.
A creepy, bony man in a black robe.
You're fidgeting with that kettle, so I expect you're thinking of doing something creative.
Put it down.
Please.
- Slowly.
- Huh!
That's not very creepy.
It's just bones.
It's just standing there.
It's not even making "whoo-whoo" noises.
And, anyway, you're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Really?
Well, let's see how creepy I can be.
Oh, no!
Couldn't have gone through you.
There's so many ribs... and things.
It only kills monsters.
Stop time now.
You winked at me.
I thought you had a plan.
Indeed.
Oh, yes.
- I planned to see what you would do.
- What?
I did add the sparkly stars and the noise, though.
I thought they would be appropriate.
And if I hadn't done anything?
I dare say I would have thought of something
- at the last minute.
- That was the last minute.
There is always time for another last minute.
Stop playing dead, Mr Teh-ah-tim-eh.
You got it right.
Of course.
I'll take care of the body.
That will prevent inconvenient questions.
Erm, you did know the poker would go through me?
I was quite confident.
Ah.
I have made this for you.
Oh!
Thank you.
What is it?
Albert said there ought to be snow on it, but it appears to have melted.
It is, of course, a Hogswatch card.
Oh.
There should have been a robin on it as well, but I had considerable difficulty in getting it to stay on.
Ah.
- It was not at all cooperative.
- Really?
It did not seem to get into the Hogswatch spirit at all.
Oh.
Thank you.
- Granddad?
- Yes?
Why?
I mean, why did you do all this?
Human beings make life so interesting.
Do you know that in a universe so full of wonders, they have managed to invent boredom?
- Quite astonishing.
- Oh.
Well, then, er...
Happy Hogswatch.
Yes.
Granddad.
Happy Hogswatch.
A Happy Hogswatch and good night, children, everywhere.
Ooh!
Hello!
Hello!
Oh, you're cute.
Yeah, come on.
Come on, let's play.
Yeah.
You have a big, wooden rocking horse in the window.
Er... yes.
That's a special order I made for...
Lord Rodney.
How much would this lordship have paid you?
- $12.
- I will give you 50.
Would you like me to wrap it, sir?
No.
I will take it as it is.
Thank you.
Incidentally, there is a small boy out there with his nose frozen to the window.
Some warm water should do the trick.
Happy Hogswatch, sir.
Everything starts somewhere, although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where, where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle the great A'tuin.
It was sometime after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories at the beginning are sooner or later about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis:
things just happen, what the hell.
And so our story begins in Ankh-Morpork the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork the biggest city in Discworld.
A city, where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets.
Our story begins on a mid-winter festival very remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
And so... it was the night before Hogswatch.
...and then Jack chops down what's the world's last beanstalk adding murder and ecological terrorism to the theft, enticement and trespass charges already mentioned, and all the Giant's children didn't have a daddy anymore.
But he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done.
Which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you're a hero because noone asks inconvenient questions.
And now, it's time for bed.
-Susan!
-Yes?
You know last week we wrote letters to the Hogfather?
-Yes?
-Well, did he really got them?
And when's he coming here?
Does it matter, if you get the presents anyway?
Yes.
Well, if you don't believe in the Hogfather, there won't be any presents.
Thought so.
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly, fat man is about to deliver their presents,
not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit.
Especially in a city where there is a guild for everything.
Khm!
The doors are locked, the windows are barred the dog does not appear to have woken up
the squeaky floorboards haven't.
I really doubt that you are a ghost and gods, generally, do not anounce themselves so politely.
You could, of course, be Death, but I don't believe he bothers with such niceties.
Besides, I am feeling quite well.
Good evening.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
Our scale of fees...
The payment will be three million dollars.
No questions asked, I assume.
No questions answered.
We need to know your name, or names, in strict client confidentiality, of course.
You may think of us as the Auditors.
Really?
What do you audit?
Everything.
We maintain the logical order of the Universe.
We need to know a little more than that.
We are the people with three million dollars.
We need to know when, where and, of course, who.
The location is not on any map, and we need the task to be completed by sunrise tomorrow.
This is essential.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
But won't he be out on his round?
Ho, ho, ho!
How would the Fat Man be inhumed?
A glass of poisoned sherry, perhaps?
You find the ways and means.
How can I contact you?
We will contact you.
We know where you are.
We know where everyone is.
Winvoe, is Mr. Teatime still in the building?
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up Tusker!
Up, Snouter!
Giddyup!
Go away!
I don't do that stuff anymore.
Yes, Twyla?
I'm afraid of the monster in the cellar, Susan.
It's going to eat me up.
What, again?
Ye gawds, there's a gel out here with a poker!
What are you doing?
Twyla said she's afraid of the monster in the cellar, Mrs. Gaiter.
-And you're going to attack it with a poker, eh?
-Yes.
Susan's our governess.
She beats up monsters with a poker?
Actually, it's a very clever idea.
My daughter gets into her head there's a monster in the cellar.
You go in with the poker and make a few bashing noises while the child listens, and then everything is all right!
Is that what you're doing, Susan?
Yes, Mrs. Gaiter.
This I've got to watch, by Io!
Not everyday you see monsters beaten up by a gel!
Come in, Mr. Teatime!
Ah, Carter, just put it on the table over there, will you.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry sir, I'll go and fetch under cup directly, sir.
-What?
-Your visitor, sir.
What visitor?
Oh, for when Mr. Tea-
Mr. Teatime?
It's pronounced Te-ah-tim-eh, sir.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with animals, sir.
I have a report... here that says that you've nailed Sir George's dog to the ceiling.
I couldn't have it barking while I was working, sir.
Some people would have drugged it.
Oh!
But I definitely fulfilled the contract.
I checked Sir George's breathing with a mirror, as instructed.
Apparently his head was several feet from his body at that point.
That was all right, wasn't it, sir?
It...
lacked elegance.
Ah, thank you sir!
I'm alwas happy to be corrected.
I shall remember that next time.
It is about the next time that I wish to talk.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
You don't have to worry.
She always wins.
Very well done!
Very persykological.
A clever idea, that bend in the poker.
I expect you're not afraid anymore, eh, my girl?
-No.
-Very persykological.
Susan says, don't get afraid, get angry!
Er, thank you, Susan!
And now, if you'd all like to come back to the parlour
- I mean, the drawing room.
Dashed convincing, the way she bent the poker like that.
-Have they all gone, Twyla?
-Yes, Susan.
Good.
That's what we do to monsters.
Now, it's back to bed for you, my girl.
-Difficult, sir.
-Certainly.
But I have devoted some time to it, sir.
You mean you've actually sat down, and thought out how to inhume the Hogfather?
Oh, yes, sir.
And the Soul Cake Duck.
And Death, sir.
I suppose I just see things differently from other people.
We maybe able to see the complaint of Sir George's estate against you with regard to his dog rather differently
and approve your graduation to full membership of the guild
Take the dark, sir?
By black, sir?
If you agree to undertake this contract.
With due elegance, of course.
With elegance guaranteed, sir.
Er, Mr. Teatime?
You have actually applied yourself to a study of ways of killing Death.
Everyone has their weak point, sir.
Susan, there's a monster under my bed, again.
Do the Voice on it!
Do the Voice on it!
No!
Not the Voice!
-Hit it on the head with the poker!
-Not the poker!
This is a friendly warning, understand, because it's Hogswatch.
What are you?
A witch, or something?
I'm just... something.
Now, you won't be around here again, will you?
Or we'll put your head under the blanket.
It's got fluffy bunnies on it.
Fluffy bunnies, no!
GO AWAY, AND STOP BOTHERING ME!
That wasn't as much fun as the one last month you know, the one when you've kicked him in the trousers.
Just go to sleep now!
's gone six.
He's not coming.
Good evening.
Do I have another drink while we wait for the other members of our little ...troupe.
-Locks.
-We have a locksmith.
-Who?
-Mr.
Brown.
And you can help me carry this.
It's rather heavy.
That's a wizard!
-No, I'm not.
I'm incognito.
-Yeah, right.
Mr. Sideney here is indeed a wizard.
A student, anyway.
This is my brother, Banjo, this is Chickenwire.
I didn't want to come.
Mr. Sideney is down on his luck at the moment.
Hence his willingness to join our little venture.
What is this?
Does it do tricks?
-It looks like a volcano!
-Really?
And I suppose we might as well make a start.
Hello, my name is Violet.
And I have been your tooth fairy for this evening.
There ain't nothing valuable, y'know!
-Nothing valueable, only a few bags of... t-t-t-t...
-Teeth.
I know.
My name's Teatime.
What's your name, sir?
Ernie.
Yes, Ernie.
Come on, gentlemen!
This is my friend, Ernie.
He's going to be our drive for tonight.
Put her in the back, Banjo!
Mister, I ain't allow to carry passangers, y'know.
Charlie'll give me a right telling-off.
Don't you worry about that.
We're all friends here.
Our Mom said no hitting girls.
Only bad boys do that.
Our Mom said...
Shut it.
-Shhhh!
-Where to, Mister?
You know the way, Ernie.
Behind the Unseen University.
Where the students of magic are still hard at work on the night before Hogswatch.
It's just a shame we don't have any radiation shielding, Bursar.
You want radiation shielding, Mr. Stibbons?
Advice from Hex, Bursar.
As the University won't supply our student an atomic particle accelerator, we started to build our own.
Safety first!
Dean, have you seen the Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic?
I need some urgent advice!
Well, ask the Chair of Indefinite Studies.
-Lecturer in Recent Runes?
-Well, you see, it all depends...
I don't know.
In my day, when I was undergraduate I wouldn't have been studying on Hogswatch night.
That's just not natural.
I'd have been sick twice by now.
Bursar!
Bursar.
Then Dean.
Oh, there you are!
Archchancellor!
Members of the faculty!
I've decided, as a Hogswatch present to myself, to open up the late Archchancellor Weatherwax's old bathroom.
So I don't have to sluice down with you fellas.
It's unhygienic.
You can catch stuff.
Here, I can't take the lot of you throught the wall.
Listen, Ernie.
Ernie, you will take us through, or, and I say that with very considerable regret,
I'll have to kill you.
But if I take you through...
What's the worst thing that can happent?
You lose your job.
Whereas if you don't, you'll die.
Really, Mustrum.
I think this is most unwise.
It said in the plans it was a bathroom.
You chaps are all acting as if the room was some kind of torture chamber.
Bathroom, designed by Bloody Stupid Johnson.
Yeah, the late Bergholt Stuttley Johnson was the worst inventor in the world, Archchancellor.
Not everything he made had a horribly fateful flaw.
Think of the thing they are using in the kitchen for peeling potatoes, for example.
You mean the thing with the brass plate on it saying:
'Improved Manicure Device'?
It's only water.
Even old Johnson can't do too much harm with water!
Go to it, lad.
You just chucks it at the wall there, and it goes twing.
Really?
May I try?
-Ah, Isn't that nice, eh, our Davey?
-Yeah.
And then you just drive forth?
Oh, yeah, right.
Quick, mind, 'cause it only stays open a little while.
Thank you very much, Ernie.
Very much, indeed.
Wasn't he dull?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
The Tooth Fairy, huh?
Another childish belief.
-Exactly.
Very elegant.
-It is.
You have to start somewhere.
Once you have their little minds in your grip, it's good bye, Hogfather!
It's him!
COULD I GIVE YOU A HAND?
Cor, yeah!
Here, your fingers are cold, mister!
SORRY.
What'd he go and do that for?
I did what he said.
Could have killed me!
YES.
I always keep a nip on me these cold nights.
Keeps me spirits up.
INDEED.
How'm I going to explain all this, then, eh?
SORRY?
THAT WAS VERY RUDE OF ME, I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.
I said what'm I going to tell people?
Letting some blokes ride off with my cart neat as you like.
That's gonna be the sack for sure!
THERE AT LEAST I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS, ERNEST.
AND, THEN AGAIN, I ALSO HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.
So, I'm dead then.
CORRECT.
NOW TELL ME ABOUT THESE BLOKES WHO STOLE YOUR CART.
AND KILLED YOU.
Honestly, Death gets worse than worse.
He seems to like humans.
So illogical.
But the beauty of the assassin's plan is that he can't interfere.
But Death can go everywhere.
No.
Not quite everywhere.
Great job...
Hello.
My name's Teatime.
What's yours?
ALBERT.
SOMETHING HERE IS NOT RIGHT.
Awk!
Too right.
This is the mythological persons' room.
How come one of them die?
SOUL CAKE DUCK.
THE TOOTH FAIRY.
THE HOGFATHER.
OH, DEAR.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
ALBERT?
WE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.
I don't know what you're expectinging me to say, but...
Shhh!
Questions first.
Babble later.
Now, Miss Bottler.
I'd like you to think of me as a friend.
How're we doing, Mr. Modo?
The tanks are full, and I've stoked the boilers, Mr Archchancellor, sir!
You can't read the signs on that door, Ridcully?
You mean the sign that says, 'do not under any circumstances open this door'?
Surely, it was sealed up for a reason.
They just wrote that to keep people out.
That's right.
That's what people do.
Don't say I didn't warn you!
Hygiene!
That's the ticket.
I still haven't worked out where all the pipes lead.
We'll find out.
Don't you fear.
Man the pumps, Mr. Modo!
Or dwarf them, of course, in your case.
She's a tooth fairy.
But she's not THE Tooth Fairy.
Shhh!
What did you expect in the Tooth Fairy's castle?
T'is just the creepiest thing I've ever...
You don't have to think.
You just have to do what I've said.
-All of them?
-Every last one.
-Put 'em in a pile?
-That's millions.
Mr. Brown.
I want you to unlock every door you can find.
What's this really all about?
Does he believe in things like the Soul Cake Duck?
The Sandman?
The Tooth Fairy?
Yeah.
Even the Hogfather.
'Cause after we're finished here, not even he will.
ONWARDS, BINKY, TO THE HOGFATHER'S CASTLE OF BONES.
First Hogswatch off in thousand years!
Even if I'm going to have the mother of all hangovers in the morning.
And how can the Hogfather bring you the presents to all at the same time?
Unless there are lots of Hogfathers.
-Look, you've always believed in the Hogfather, yes?
-Yes...
Well, if you don't believe in him, he won't come down the chimney.
It's a very small chimney.
And a very small stocking if you don't go to sleep!
...SOOT...
PORKPIE...
OH, YES.
AND...
HO, HO, HO.
There's a tap in there marked 'Old Faithful'... which I think, perhaps, we might leave alone for now.
This is a most perculiar Hogswatch.
Any mustard?
They're a treat with mustard.
APPLESAUCE.
I'M FINDING THE BEARD A BIT OF A TRIAL.
Well, at least it's keeping you in the right frame of mind, master.
In character, sort of thing.
BUT GOING DOWN THE CHIMNEY?
WHERE'S THE SENSE IN THAT?
It's got to be chimneys.
A bit like the beard, really.
D'you think these little buggers'd be writing to someone who could walk through walls if they knew?
Oh, that reminds me.
The 'Ho, ho, ho' could use some more work, if you don't mind me saying so.
HO, HO, HO?
No, no, no!
No, you got to put a bit more life in it, sir.
No offense intended.
You gotta got to be a big, fat laugh, sir.
You know, like... ho-hoo, ho, ho, ho, ho!
, see?
You got to sound like you're pissing brandy and crapping plum pudding, sir.
If you pardon my Klatchian.
REALLY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?
Well, I used to be young meself once, sir.
Surprising as it may seem.
The teeth give me the creeps.
Just keep going!
Why do we pile them all up?
You don't wanna know.
The quicker all the teeth are in the pile, the quicker we are out of here with our money.
No one ever laid a punch on Banjo since our Mom died.
Tough but fair, huh?
You know, I recall that time she strangled Glossy Ron with his own leg.
Yeah.
Maybe the both of us could creep up on him and...
Yeah!
I keep thinking of that glass eye watching me.
I keep thinking it can see right in my head.
Don't worry, he doesn't know what you're thinking.
Well, how do you know?
You're still alive.
These damn eyeballs are hard, aren't they?
They're walnuts, not eyeballs.
I don't want you back in my life, understand?
Don't say you've never been warned.
Warned?
Did you check the list?
COULD NOT REALLY MAKE HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
I DON'T NORMALLY CARE IF THEY'VE BEEN NAUGHTY OR NICE.
I CAN FEEL BELIEF IN THE HOGFATHER FADING.
What's that?
IT LOOKS VERY BAD.
No, no, it's just there's some nibling it, that's all.
I MEAN THE SITUATION.
I FEAR WE MAY BE TOO LATE.
Never say die, master.
That's our motto.
I CAN'T SAY IT'S EVER REALLY BEEN MINE.
You'd better watch out!
Because if the Hogfather still comes to town, as a result of a magical misjudgement on your part, then you'd no longer be my friend, Mr. Sideney.
I understand, sir.
Do you have a lot of friends, Mr. Sideney?
Well, quite a few, actually.
I don't have many.
Don't seem to have the knack.
On the other hand...
I don't seem to have any enemies at all.
It's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
-That is, very subtle.
And will make the pile of teeth very...
-Mr.
Teatime!
...dangerous.
Grandfather, this is Hogswatch.
It is supposed to be jolly, with mistletoe and holly.
And other things... ending in -olly.
It's a time when people are meant to feel good about things and eat until they explode.
A time when they want to see all their... relatives.
I mean it's a time when humans are really human.
And they don't want... a skeleton at the feast.
Especially one, I might add, who is wearing a false beard, and has got a damn cushion shoved up his robe.
I mean, why?
ALBERT SAID IT WOULD HELP ME GET INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE THING.
This is a real job.
And I was looking forward to a real Hogswatch, when normal things happen, with normal people, in a normal house.
And suddenly, the old circus comes to town!
Well, I don't know what's going on, but you can just leave, right now.
-Albert!
-Bugger it.
Master, I'm stuck.
The pixie.
Oh, come along in, do!
If the real Hogfather doesn't turn up soon there's not going to be enough room for him.
HE WON'T BE JOINING US.
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons, I will add, then that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
THE HOGFATHER IS UNAVAILABLE.
-At Hogswatch?
-YES.
Why?
HE IS...
LET ME SEE...
THERE ISN'T AN ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE HUMAN WORD, SO...
LET'S SETTLE FOR...
GONE.
YES, HE IS GONE.
How can the Hogfather be gone?
He's... isn't he what you are?
Anth...
ANTH-RO-PO-MOR-PHIC PER-SON-IF-IC-A-TION.
YES.
HE HAS BECOME THE SPIRIT OF HOGSWATCH.
And while he's gone you've taken over.
That's sick.
I SEE THE GIRL WRITES IN GREEN CRAYON ON PINK PAPER
WITH A MOUSE IN THE CORNER.
THE MOUSE IS WEARING A DRESS.
I ought to point out that she decided to do that so the Hogfather would think she was sweet.
Including the deliberate bad spelling.
But look, why are you doing the-
SHE SAYS SHE IS FIVE YEARS OLD.
Seven.
In cynicism, she's about thirtyfive.
But why are you doing the-
BUT SHE BELIEVES IN THE HOGFATHER?
She'd believe in anything if there was a dolly in it for her.
But you're not going to leave without telling me-
And what are you doing here, Albert?
I thought you'd die if you ever came back to the world.
AH, BUT WE ARE NOT IN THE WORLD.
WE ARE IN THE SPECIAL CONGRUENT REALITY CREATED FOR THE HOGFATHER.
NORMAL RULES HAVE TO BE SUSPENDED.
HOW ELSE COULD ANYONE GET AROUND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN ONE NIGHT?
That's right.
I'm one of the Hogfather's Little Helpers, me.
It's official.
I'v got the little pointy green hat with a bell, and everything.
Have you been good, have you?
NOW, WE MUST BE GOING.
HAPPY HOGSWATCH!
AND, OH YES.
HO, HO, HO.
It's a nice drop of sherry, this.
You've actually been drinking the actual drinks little children leave out for the actual Hogfather?
Yeah, why not?
He won't be drinking anymore, will he?
Not where he's gone.
How many have you had, may I ask?
Dunno.
Haven't been counting.
ONE MILLION, EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND, SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIX.
AND SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND, THREE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN PORK PIES.
AND ONE TURNIP.
Well, It looked pork-pie shaped.
Everything does, after a while.
Why are you doing this?
I AM SORRY.
I CANNOT TELL YOU.
FORGET YOU SAW ME.
IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS.
Not my business?
How can you say-
YOU WANTED TO BE NORMAL.
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDDAUGHTER.
Sleep tight!
Better watch out... pardon.
We're running out of doors.
I hope this is the one.
This isn't the room we're looking for.
Just teeth in here.
Keep going, Mr. Brown.
Susan will try to find out what this is all about, you know.
OH, DEAR.
Especially after you've told her not to.
-YOU THINK SO?
-Oh, yes.
DEAR ME, I STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT HUMANS, DON'T I?
Well, I dunno.
OBVIOUSLY, IT WOULD BE QUITE WRONG
TO INVOLVE A HUMAN IN ALL THIS.
THAT IS WHY, YOU WILL RECALL,
I CLEARLY FORBAD HER TO TAKE AN INTEREST.
Yes, you did.
BESIDES, IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.
Yes, that's a shame, really, because she likes to break them, doesn't she?
YOU MIGHT THINK I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT,
BUT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT.
AND WE HAVE MUCH TO DO.
WE HAVE THE HOGFATHER'S PROMISES TO KEEP.
He did something to the real Hogfather.
Binky.
Can't she be eliminated?
Oh, yes.
She's mostly human.
Oh, good.
Then can we go back to just concentrating on running the Universe?
Making sure that gravity works and that atoms spin.
Yes, when there is not an atom of belief left in the world.
And the Hogfather is just the beginning.
What are you looking for, Mustrum?
My father always said that where you get lots of people bathing together, the Verruca Gnome is running around with his little sack.
Modo, any sign of the Verruca Gnome down there, old boy?
Welcome home, Susan.
You toook your time.
I don't do family reunions.
The Sandman.
Soul Cake Duck.
Tooth Fairy...
The Hogfather.
Grandfather, what have you done?
THIS CUSHION IS STILL UNCOMFORTABLE.
You're doing well, master.
Soot in the fireplaces, footprints, swigged cherry.
The sleightracks all over the roofs.
It's got to work!
YOU THINK SO?
Oh, yeah!
Here's a little tip, though. 'Ho, ho, ho' will do.
Don't say, 'Cower, brief mortals'!
OH, REALLY?
SO MANY CHIMNEYS.
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH QUICKER IF I LOST THE CUSHION.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, if we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
No, I mean the Hogfather.
So, you got to look the part, master.
I tell you what would be really good to boost belief.
A public appearance!
I DON'T NORMALLY DO THEM.
But the Hogfather is more of a public figure, master.
I tell you what, one good public appearance'll do more good than any amount of letting kids see you by accident.
REALLY?
And I know just the place.
Thank you very much.
Everything going well, Mr. Parson?
Yes, Mr. Crumley.
Jolly good.
LET'S GO, SLEIGH THEM.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, ALBERT,
BUT THAT WAS A PUNE, OR PLAY ON WORDS.
Ho, ho, ho, sir.
Stop that!
Stop that!
You're frightening the little kiddies!
Wow, they've got tusks!
Cool!
Hey, look, that one's doing a wee!
It's the Campaign for Equal Heights that've done this, isn't it!
They're out to ruin me!
That's it!
I don't mind the smell of oranges and the damp trousers but I ain't putting up with this.
And he's not even doin' it right!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
Come on!
Who are you?
You can call me Uncle Heavy.
You're not a pixie!
Nah, I'm a fairy cobbler, mister!
Quiet!
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR HOGSWATCH, SMALL HUMAN?
They're autobiographies, writing down everything that happens to you, as it happens.
I know.
I used to live here, remember?
But I can't read this.
The letters are all... odd.
So, I suppose, now you'll be wanting my words of occult wisdom.
Ethereal runes.
The Hogfather is not human, after all.
I suppose a bit of warm liver is out of the question?
On the second day of Hogswatch, I sent my true love back
A nasty little letter, and a partridge in a pear tree.
What's the game then?
Small-time thief, are you?
You ain't supposed to be able to see me!
I'm a wizard!
We can see things that are really there, you know.
What's in this bag?
You'll really wish you hadn't, mister.
Will I?
What're you doing here, young man?
Well, you know the Tooth Fairy?
It's sort of like the same business.
What?
You take things away?
Not take away, as such.
More sort of bring.
Ah ...
like new teeth.
Like new verrucas.
I saw your piggie do a wee.
OH.
ER...
GOOD.
It had a great, big...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR HOGSWATCH?
She wants a-
I want an army.
And a big castle with an active drawbridge.
And a sword.
They're supposed to say thank you.
ARE YOU SURE?
PEOPLE DON'T, NORMALLY.
No, I meant to the Hogfather, which is you, right!
Sorry.
YES, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY THANK YOU.
'enk you.
AND BE GOOD.
THIS IS PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT.
Yes.
THEN WE HAVE A CONTRACT.
Verrucas, eh?
Wish I knew why!
You mean you don't know?
No.
Suddenly I wake up and I'm the Verruca Gnome.
Strange.
Anyway, amazing bathroom, ain't it?
It's got a special pot for your toenail clippings.
A special pot for toenail clippings?
Oh, can't be too careful.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clipping, hair, teeth...
You got them under your control.
I mean, that's real old magic.
Children of the world, prepare to take a short tour.
Mr. Sideney!
Your big, no-misjudgements magic moment.
You can't give her that!
That's not safe.
IT'S A SWORD.
THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE SAFE.
She's a child!
IT'S EDUCATIONAL.
What if she cuts herself?
THAT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT LESSON.
REALLY?
OH, WELL.
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO ARGUE, I SUPPOSE.
And she doesn't want all that other stuff.
She's a girl!
And anyway, I can't afford big posh stuff like that.
I THOUGHT I GAVE IT AWAY.
-You do?
-You do?
You don't!
That's our Merchandise!
You don't just give it away!
Hogswatch isn't about giving everything away!
I mean, yes, you do give things away, but you have to buy them first!
You mean this is all free?
It... would seem to be.
So, Mr. Stibbons.
This thing is a great, big artificial brain, then.
You could think of it like that.
Of course, Hex doesn't actually think.
Not as such.
It just appears to be thinking.
Amazing.
You mean it gives the impression of thinking, but really it's just a show.
Er, yes.
So it's like everyone else, then.
I knew I'd come here for something.
Now, this here chappie is the Verruca Gnome.
Who's just popped into existence to be with us on Hogswatchnight.
The most magical night of the year.
Last year's occult rubbish piling' up.
I just thought you fellows might check up on this.
Verruca Gnome?
Makes about as much sense as anything else, doesn't it?
After all, there's a Tooth Fairy, ain' there?
Makes on wonder why there's a God of Wine and not a God of Hangovers?
Anyone hear that noise just then?
Sorry, Archchancellor?
Sort of glingleglingleglingle?
Like a lot of tinkly bells?
Didn't hear anything like that, sir.
Oh.
Well, where was I?
So, no one's ever seen a Verruca Gnome until tonight.
I've never heard of me until tonight, and I'm me.
We'll see what Hex can find out, Archchancellor.
Good man.
Amazing.
Now we should be able to get to the bottom of all this.
None of this is right.
Everyone knows he's just a jolly, old, fat man who hands out presents to kids.
-He wasn't always so jolly.
You know how it is.
-Do I?
That's like, you know, industrial retraining.
Even gods have to move with the times.
You see, your Hogfather was probably just your basic winter demi-urge.
You know, blood on the snow, making the sun come up.
So there has to be blood to make the sun come up?
Starts off with animal sacrifice, y'know, hunt some big hairy animal to death, that kind of stuff.
Very folkloric, very myffic.
Can't stop an animal, never.
They've had sacred paints, the strongest and the best.
Died on the dark time of the year to give life to the unconquered sun.
And, in a way, the Hogfather was all of it.
And then?
And then some bright spark thought, hey, looks like that damn sun comes up anyway, so how come we're giving those druids all this free grub?
The world moves on, and he's got to find a new job.
So it started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up.
Exactlimondo!
And now, he gives out presents.
Top of the evening, squire.
I am Corporal Nobbs of the Watch.
And this is Constable Visit, sir.
I want you to arrest him!
Arrest who, sir?
The Hogfather!
What for, sir?
He's sitting up there as bold as brass in his Grotto, giving away presents!
Not quite up to speed here, sir.
I thought the Hogfather is supposed to give away stuff, isn't he?
But this one is an impostor!
Y'know, I always thought that.
I thought, the Hogfather spends two weeks in a wooden grotto in some shop in Ankh-Morpork?
At his busy time, too?
Not likely.
He's not the Hogfather we usually have!
You mean, a different impostor?
Not the real impostor at all?
Yes!
...
No!
-Arrest the Hogfather, style of thing?
-Yes!
-On Hogswtach night?
-Yes!
For giving away present?
-In front of all these kiddies?
-Yes!
-In your shop?
-Ye... you think it might look a bit... bad?
Difficult to see how it could look good, sir.
Could you not do it surreptitiously?
Oh, well, yes.. surreptition.
Yes, we could give that a try...
You won't find me ungrateful.
In Omnia, we call the Hogswatch night the Fast of St. Ossory.
But it is not an occasion for superstition and crass commercialism.
I used to hang up my stocking every Hogswatch, regular.
All that ever happened that my dad was sick in it once.
I'm going in.
There seems to be a thaumic surge from somewhere.
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
IT'S THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR LITTLE FACES I LIKE.
Yeah.
The sort of cross between fear and awe.
Not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants.
YES.
NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL BELIEF.
NEXT!
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME, LITTLE...
PERSON?
Nobby Nobbs, Hogfather.
AND HAVE YOU BEEN A GOOD BO ...
A GOOD DWA ...
A GOOD GNO ...
A GOOD INDIVIDUAL?
'es.
So why isn't it working?
The chalk, just got a bit scuffed when we were piling up the.. things.
You sure that's what it is?
What about the spell?
Oh, that'll go on for ever.
The simple ones do.
It's just a state change, powered by the... it just keeps going.
That's very good, Mr. Sideney.
Because if the sympathetic magic does not work, you'll find me very... unsympathetic.
What happened?
What happened?
This is disgusting, this whole business.
It is the worship of idols!
It's a genuine Burleigh and Stronginthearm doubleaction triple-cantilever crossbow with a polished walnut stock and silver engraved facings.
Aren't we going to arrest this impostor, corporal?
You're foreign, Washpot.
I can't expect you to know the real meaning of Hogswatch.
ON THE WHOLE, I THINK THAT WENT VERY WELL, DON'T YOU?
Yes, master.
AND I THINK I'VE GOT THE LAUGH WORKING REALLY WELL NOW.
HO!
HO!
HO!
Yes, sir, very jolly.
Tomorrow morning, they'll believe, all right.
THEY'D BETTER.
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T...
THEN THERE WON'T BE A TOMORROW MORNING.
So for the sun to come up tomorrow morning, the Hogfather has to be alive.
Precisemento.
What if he's dead?
And this was going to be your big moment.
It's him!
Such a shame!
Pretty lights...
Think happy, Banjo.
Wake up!
Wake up!
You got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
You're not the Hogfather!
There must be thousands here.
And what's all this stuff?
's just paper.
They're title deeds for properties.
And they're better than money.
If we steal them, do they become ours?
Is that a trick question?
Anyway, let's get going.
He won't miss a few-
Gentlemen.
We were just... piling up the stuff.
I know people say I'd kill them as soon as look at them.
And in fact I'd much rather kill you than look at you, Mr. Lilywhite.
You're thinking that Banjo is going to help you.
That's how it's always been, isn't it?
But Banjo is my friend now.
Banjo has the heart of a little child.
I believe I have, too.
Help them, Banjo.
As far as this goes, I really have no use for it.
It's only pillow money.
Something much more... interesting has become apparent.
Albert.
I don't see the Hogfather as someone who rolls his own.
Drop him.
Control!
Control the inner child, and he'll even give you his teeth.
And somewhere in this tower, you can help me find someone, who can use it.
Who can use it to... give me the world.
So what said, take the money and go?
Don't be so bloody stupid.
Daddy?
I say, it's not what you think!
Yes, it is.
Mr. Brown!
There's one door you haven't found.
Find the Tooth Fairy's secret room.
And when he does... then just think, what I can make the kiddies think.
Are you all right?
I wish I was dead.
I think you may have come to the right place.
-Oh, my head...
-Are you the Hogf...?
I feel awful.
Have you got any ice?
DUTY CALLS.
Yeah, but which one?
That one or this one?
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
Yet to come, on Hogfather:
Happy Hogswatch!
Very well, I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
IF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE TOOTH FAIRY'S CASTLE IS NOT STOPPED,
THEN EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DOING IS A WASTE OF TIME.
AND IF THEY GET TO THE TOOTH FAIRY,
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ALL HUMAN BELIEF.
Mr. Brown, break me up the real Tooth Fairy.
UNLESS SUSAN GETS THERE FIRST.
I need your help, Mr. Ridcully.
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr. Teatime?
Something nasty is happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is, but he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you've brought him here?
He is the Oh God of Hangovers.
I wish you fellows would show some backbone!
-My grandfather is Death.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
This is fascinating.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr. Teacup.
I'm leaving, right?
With what's coming to me.
And you ain't stopping me.
What is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's Castle?
You're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Then let's see how creepy I can be.
Who the hell are you?
I'M THE HOGFATHER, OF COURSE.
ER...
HO, HO, HO.
YES, THIS WILL SHOW.
You are not allowed to do that.
THERE'S NO BETTER PRESENT THAN THE FUTURE.
Belief's causing new creatures to appear.
Is there a problem?
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU, THINKING ENGINE.
BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER!
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER!
YOU MUST BRING THE HOGFATHER HOME!
I'm going to have such fun with this.
So light.
You wouldn'd dare use it.
My grandfather will come after you.
He comes after everyone.
He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
It was the night before Hogswatch.
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up Tusker!
Up, Snouter!
Giddyup!
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly, fat man is about to deliver their presents,
not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
We offer you a commission.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
If you don't believe in the Hogfather, there won't be any presents.
Thought so.
Is Mr. Teatime still in the building?
It's pronounced Te-ah-tim-eh, sir.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with animals, sir.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
ALBERT.
SOMETHING HERE IS NOT RIGHT.
-Does he believe in things like the Tooth Fairy?
-Even the Hogfather.
'Cause after we're finished here, not even he will.
It's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
THE HOGFATHER.
OH, DEAR.
ALBERT?
WE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.
ONWARDS, BINKY, TO THE HOGFATHER'S CASTLE OF BONES.
-All of them?
-Every last one.
-Put 'em in a pile?
-That's millions.
APPLESAUCE.
OH, YES.
AND...
HO, HO, HO.
Grandfather?
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons, I will add, then that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
THE HOGFATHER IS UNAVAILABLE.
At Hogswatch?
HE IS GONE.
Susan will try to find out what this is all about.
YOU MIGHT THINK I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT,
BUT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clipping, hair, teeth...
You got them under your control.
Children of the world, prepare to take a short tour.
The Hogfather.
Grandfather, what've you done?
SO MANY CHIMNEYS.
I mean, if we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
No, I mean the Hogfather.
So, you got to look the part!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
IT'S THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR LITTLE FACES I LIKE.
Yeah.
The sort of cross between fear and awe.
Not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants.
YES.
NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL BELIEF.
Pretty lights...
You're not the Hogfather!
Daddy?
Wake up!
Wake up!
You got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
-It's not what you think!
-Yes, it is.
Are you the Hogf...?
Everything starts somewhere, although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where, where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle the great A'tuin.
It was sometime after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories at the beginning are sooner or later
about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis:
things just happen, what the hell.
Our story began in Ankh-Morpork the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork the biggest city in Discworld.
A city, where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for wizards looms over all the dark, narrow streets below.
Our story continues in the middle of the night before Hogswatch, a mid-winter festivel, which, for some reason, bears a remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
But now it takes us to the Tooth Fairys castle, where magic's made children's teeth periliously powerful.
So that our story is, much sooner rather than later, about blood.
Mr. Teatime!
Very well, I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
I'm not telling you anything!
Who are you, anyway?
I'm glad you've asked!
I'm your worst nightmare!
You mean ... the one with the giant cabbage and the kind of whirring knife thing?
Sorry, no.
Not that one.
I'm the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you stone dead.
Oh, that one.
But that's not very...
Rather a charitable act there, I feel.
But it is nearly Hogswatch, after all.
Bring me the girl.
ODD.
It's a scythe job, then?
They took the teeth!
All of them!
They just walked in, and... no, wait!
Where did he come from?
A PLACE I CANNOT GO.
Well, you'd better pull down.
We've got Alber come out here, keeping the Hogfather's seat warm.
IF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE TOOTH FAIRY'S CASTLE ISN'T STOPPED,
THEN EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DOING IS A WASTE OF TIME.
AND IF THEY GET TO THE TOOTH FAIRY,
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ALL HUMAN BELIEF.
UNLESS SUSAN GETS THERE FIRST.
Yes, well, it's coming along well.
Very impressive!
Well done.
I need your help, Mr. Ridcully.
I, err... you're...
Yes.
The scythe, the cloak, the white horse, the granddaughter.
I need you to wake him up.
His name's Bilious.
He's the oh God of Hangovers.
Something nasty's happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is.
But he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you brought him here?
Why are you doing that?
-I mean, I was a bit behind with the teeth, I know...
-Is this her door?
-Don't know, there was 13 dollars in pillow money...
-Is this her door?
I admit, but I signed the form GV19 for them...
Will you just shut up and answer the question?
I don't know, I've never been here before.
Your boss probably doesn't realise how irritating you are.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Or Miss Bottler gets is.
S'that good, I g'it!
Have you got the lid?
THIS IS REALLY, REALLY STUPID.
I think the tradition got started when everyone had them big chimneys, master.
INDEED?
IT'S ONLY A MERCY IT'S UNLIT.
THE BOY WANTS A PAIR OF TROUSERS THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE,
A HUGE MEAT PIE, A SUGAR MOUSE, 'A LOT OF TOYS' AND A PUPPY CALLED SCRUFF.
Ah, sweet.
I shall wipe away a tear, 'cos what he's gettin', see, is this little wooden toy and an apple.
BUT THE LETTER CLEARLY...
I know, it's the socio-economic factors.
The world'd be in a hell of a mess if everyone got what they asked for, eh?
I GAVE THEM WHAT THEY WANTED IN THE STORE.
What good's a god who gives you everything you want?
YOU HAVE ME THERE.
It's the hope that's important.
It's a big part of belief, hope.
Give people jam today and they'll just sit and eat it.
Jam tomorrow, now - that'll keep them going for ever.
AND YOU MEAN THAT BECAUSE OF THIS THE POOR GET POOR THINGS
AND THE RICH GET RICH THINGS?
Oh, yeah.
That's the meaning of Hogswatch, isn't it, master?
BUT I'M THE HOGFATHER!
AT THE MOMENT, I MEAN.
Makes no difference.
I remember when I was a nipper, it was one Hogswatch.
I had my heart set on this huge model horse in this shop.
It was what I always wanted.
Someone was in there buying it.
And you know, just for a second,
I thought it really was going to be for me.
But it wasn't.
I spent hours with my nose pressed up against the window, until someone heard me callin', and unfroze me.
I'd've killed for that horse.
But I still hung up my stocking on Hogswatch Eve.
You know why?
Because I had hope!
And the next morning, our dad's put in my stocking a little wooden horse, that he carved his very own self.
AH, AND THAT WAS WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE EXPENSIVE TOY HORSES IN THE WORLD!
No, 'cause you're a selfish little bugger when you're seven.
Only grown-ups think like that.
THIS IS WRONG.
IT IS...
UNFAIR.
That's life, is it, master, isn't it?
BUT I'M NOT.
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY.
AND OTHER THINGS ENDING IN OLLY.
Please, just take her out of vocal range.
Mr. Brown!
Your big moment.
Break me up the real Tooth Fairy.
If you're the Lecturer in Recent Runes, can't you do something more magical?
Well, Spold's Unstirring Divisor would do it.
You'd end up with a large beaker full of all the nastiness.
Not difficult at all, if you don't mind the side effects.
Tell me about the side effects.
The main one is that the rest of him would end up in a somewhat larger beaker.
Alive?
Broadly, yes.
Living tissue, certainly.
And definitely sober.
Why don't we just mix up absolutely everything and see what happens?
It's got to be worth a try.
Thank you, Modo.
Is this going to take much longer?
We may not have much time.
Oh, you can't be too careful.
What's that?
Wow-Wow Sauce.
The hottest sauce in the Universe.
And it will blow your head clean off.
It's not safe to drink it when sweat's still condensing on the bottle.
On the other hand, it's a kill-or-cure remedy then we are, given the possibility that the patient is immortal, probably on to a winner.
It did not go critical yet.
I don't know, I wish you fellows would show some backbone...
Careful, Archchancellor.
What you have there might represent pure sobriety!
I'll try it.
You did say that he was immortal, didn't you?
-You mean... he just appeared?
-Yes.
He has no memory of existing before appearing at the Hogfather's castle.
You mean like this fella?
Don't be ridiculous, gods and gnomes don't just appear for no reason!
Bring me, let's see, twenty pints of lager, some pepper vodka, and a bottle of cofee liquor.
I didn't have you sobered up just so that you can go on a binge.
-You don't drink!
-I don't?
Oh.
Yeah.
I need you to help me!
I'm afraid did it, didn't I?
I said something to young Stibbons about drinking and hangovers.
You mean you created him just like that?
I find that very hard to believe.
Good job nobody mentioned the Hair Loss Fairy, then.
I am not losing my hair!
It is just very finely spaced.
Yes, half on your head and half on your hairbrush!
For the last time, I am not...
I wish I knew where that was coming from.
We need a bigger brain for this.
That thinking engine of yours is working, Ponder?
Hex is resting, Archchancellor.
Can you hear me in there!
?
You don't have to shout, Archchancellor.
What is that glingleglingleglingle noise all about?
It says, look on the Dean.
Over the Dean?
Is there a problem?
Are you the Hair Loss Fairy?
Apparently.
What have you been doing with my hair?
Just a minute!
Where exactly were you, before I found you in the snow?
Anywhere where drink was consumed in beastly quantities some time previously, you could say.
So, you were an immanent vital force, eh?
Oh, sounds great!
What is that?
So when we joked about the Hair Loss Fairy it suddenly focused on the Dean's head.
You're calling things into being.
I personally always wondered, if there was an Eater of Socks.
You know how there's always one missing.
To the laundry!
Tell me again, who these people are.
Some of the cleverest men in the world.
And I'm sober, am I?
What is that ridiculous thing on your head?
I dunno, sir!
What?
What is it?
It says here, 'If found, please return to the Tooth Fairy's castle.'
At least the Tooth Fairy already existed.
Tooth Fairy...
Oh, you see her around a lot these days.
Or them, rather.
It's a sort of franchise operation to collect children's teeth in exchange for money.
And she has a castle?
She sounds great.
Actually, I do remember one thing.
When I appeared at the Hogfather's house, there was this drunken little fellow in a pointy hat.
I thought it was just the drink talking, but he did mention something about...
Permanent end of the patrol-servitude for the little elves!
Of all fantasy personifications.
...including the Tooth Fairy.
Where did you find this?
Is he all right?
I say, what is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's castle?
Now I'm feeling all well.
Can I come with you?
This is not a normal situation.
Look, I think I better tell you.
-My grandfather is Death.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Death.
You know, Death?
The robes, the scythe, the white horse, bones..
Death.
But at the moment he's acting rather strange.
I just want to make sure I got this clear.
You think your grandfather is Death, and you think he's acting strange.
Look, Death adopted my mother.
He then took on a human apprentice.
They fell in love, and I'm the result.
This is fascinating.
Let's just say I've picked up a few, strange genetic signs on the way.
Oh, that looks dangerous.
I hope so.
Wait, I could help you!
Would you be any good in a fight?
Yes, I could be sick on people!
I have to sort this out.
Can't have creatures popping into existence just by people talking about them.
Unhygienic.
So what is this implied creation, eh?
Humans have always ascribed random, seasonal, natural or inexplicable actions to human shaped entities.
Such examples are the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy and Death.
All right, but I'm damn sure there's never been an Eater of Socks or an oh God of Hangovers.
I think it works like this:
What we're getting is personification of forces, just like Hex said.
Like the Hogfather?
When you're a kiddie, it's as good an explanation, as any to where the presents come from.
Why is it happening now?
Belief's causing new creatures to appear?
You could put it like that.
There's a finite quantitiy of belief in the Universe?
Certainly, people're going to believe only in so many things.
It follows that if a major focus of belief is removed, there would be spare belief.
What are people not believing in all of a sudden?
Out of cheese error?
Melon, melon, melon.
Redo from start!
It's Hogswatch.
I suppose the Hogfather is around, isn't he?
I LIKE THIS JOB.
Oh dear, oh dear.
EXCUSE ME.
YES.
THIS WILL SHOW.
The poor little match girls dying in the snow is all part of the spirit of Hogswatch, master.
You see, people hear about it, and they say:
'we might be as poor as a disabled banana, and only can afford to eat mud and boots, but see how much better off we are than the poor little match girl?
'
It makes them feel happy and grateful for what they've got.
I KNOW WHAT THE SPIRIT OF HOGSWATCH IS, ALBERT.
You're not allowed to do that!
THE HOGFATHER CAN.
THE HOGFATHER GIVES PRESENTS.
THERE IS NO BETTER PRESENT THAN THE FUTURE.
That's it.
I had enough with this pixie life.
I'm waiting for the Hogfather.
I'm in the dark, waiting for the Hogfather.
Me.
A believer in natural philosophy.
I can find the square root of 27.4 in my head.
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's not as if I've hung a stocking up.
There'd be some point if...
TAKE HER SOMEWHERE WARM, AND GIVE HER A GOOD DINNER.
AND I MAY WELL BE CHECKING ON LATER.
Looks like we've been chosen to do a bit of charity.
Well, I don't call it very charitable just dumping someone on people, like this.
I dunno.
Some people wouldn't know the real meaning of Hogswatch if it jumps up and caught them in the grope.
No!
This is a child's painting.
Twyla paints like that.
I painted like that.
Grandfather saved some of my draw-
Come on, let's find the house.
What house?
There's always a house.
I was told you're the best locksmith in the city.
Yes, but locks normally don't alter themselves while you're working on them, that's what I'm saying.
Are you the best, or not?
No!
Not the dark!
Banjo!
I'm getting out of here.
Something's wrong with this place.
I've made a big pile!
You want to come with me?
Pretty here.
Mr. Sideney.
Would he deliver to apes earlier than to humans?
Interesting point, sir.
Possibly, you are referring to my theory that humans may have descended from apes.
A bold hypothesis, which, if the grants committee could just see their way clear to letting me hire a boat, and sail around... to the islands...
I just thought, he might deliver alphabetically.
LET ME SEE NOW...
Who the hell are you?
I'M THE HOGFATHER, OF COURSE.
ER...
HO, HO, HO.
You look extremely thin in the face.
I'M...
I'M A BIT ILL.
Terminately, I would say.
It's a false beard!
NO, IT'S NOT!
It's got hooks for the ears!
That must have given you a spot of trouble.
A pillow!
I thought there were seven locks.
Yes, but they're half magic and half real and half not there.
There's parts of them that don't exist all the time!
I thought you could open any lock anyone ever made.
Made by humans, And most dwarfs.
I dunno what made these.
You never said anything about magic.
That's a shame.
Then really I have no more need of your services.
You may as well go back home.
What about my money?
Of course, you should get what you deserve.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr. Teacup.
I'm leaving, right?
With what's coming to me.
And you ain't stopping me.
Banjo certainly ain't.
I knew his old Ma in the good old days.
You think you're nasty?
You think you're mean?
Ma Lilywhite'd tear your ears off and spit 'em in your eye, you cocky little devil.
I remembers you when you was little, Banjo.
I used to sit you on my knees!
Banjo!
There you are.
Where do all those shadows coming from?
It's giving me the creeps!
And it's all your fault!
Oh, yeah?
So it wasn't you who said, wow, ten thousand dollars, count me in?
Yeah, but I didn't know there was going to be all this creepy stuff!
I want to go home!
You're acting like a child!
Poor guy must've slipped.
Yeah.
He slipped.
That's the Tooth Fairy's castle?
It's teeth.
And I should be scared?
There's nothing that scary about teeth.
Did I say I was scared?
I must just be hung over, again.
-Oh, no.
-They're only teeth?
Surely, noone would try to...
What is that?
It's such old magic, it isn't even magic anymore.
If you've got a piece of someone's hair, nail clippings or tooth, you can control them.
Don't tell me someone is...
-What's that shadow?
-This place is alive.
And it's protecting itself.
Now, what happened to the other fellow?
WELL, THE HOGFATHER HAS ENEMIES.
What'd he do?
Miss a chimney?
There's people down there, Mr. Teatime!
Well, just do away with them.
One of them is a girl.
Then do away with them... politely.
Keep going.
Quicker.
Aaah!
It's after me!
Let me out!
What was that?
It's finding their nightmares.
Let me out!
It's after me!
Pull yourself together.
There's nothing chasing you.
I thought it was the... wardrobe.
What wardrobe?
When I was a kid, we had this big... wardrobe.
And it had this... on the door... it had this face!
And it made me... whispered things.
Who's that moving up there?
I think they saw us.
If they are tooth fairies, there has been a really stupid equal opportunity policy.
Right.
You go that way, I this way.
-Why don't we stay together?
-What's got into you?
This is a children's place.
The rules are what children believe.
Well, that's a relief.
You think so?
It's impossible to die here.
My grandfather doesn't figure in the child's world.
That man who fell down the stairs looked pretty dead to me.
Oh, you die.
But not here.
You...
let's see... yes.
You go somewhere else.
Away.
-Aren't you Sus...?
-Yes.
When you came for Twyla's last tooth, you were so shocked I could see you.
Look, we may not have a lot of time.
Is this the Tooth Fairy?
A tooth fairy.
Do you drink at all?
No, I don't.
Not touch alcohol, at all?
Never.
My dad's very strict about that sort of thing.
Nice castle!
Can we get on?
Good.
Who brought you here, Violet?
I don't know.
Oh, but he's dressed like an assassin!
OK.
You two stay here, I'll go, find him.
And I'll look after Violet.
That's the fourth lock, open.
I commend your expertise.
And the others?
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr. Teatime?
Logically, she's the guardian of children's beliefs.
And this is her castle.
And I come across as securely locked door as this, and not to thoroughly investigate woud... lack elegance.
What's that sound?
What sound?
That sound!
Like all... scissors, grating.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE AUDITORS?
I suppose the Bursar might have done.
NOT AUDITORS OF MONEY.
AUDITORS OF REALITY.
THEY'RE THE CIVIL SERVICE OF EVERYTHING.
And they want to get rid of us.
THEY WANT HUMANS TO BE LESS CREATIVE.
THE HOGFATHER IS A SYMBOL OF THIS.
STRANGE THINKING.
THEY HATE THE WAY HUMANS MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT THE UNIVERSE.
I can't think why.
Anyway, why are you doing this job?
SOMEONE MUST.
IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT.
BEFORE DAWN, THERE MUST BE ENOUGH BELIEF IN THE HOGFATHER.
Why?
SO THAT THE SUN WILL COME UP.
I SELDOM JOKE.
What sort of goding do you do?
Well, I'm the oh God of Hangovers.
A God of Hangovers?
How awful.
You're more cut out to be one of those improtant gods.
What's this?
Lovers' Lane?
You leave him alone, you!
He's a god!
Dear me, out of thunderbolts, are we?
Well, y'know, I've never killed a...
What's the matter?
It is a wardrobe, yes.
I don't want to see!
I don't want to see!
Hex was right, Archchancellor.
HEX?
WHO IS HEX?
He's the biggest thinker in the world.
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THIS MR. HEX.
Quite a large thaumic reading, gentlemen.
I think he got here by magic.
THEY SAY YOU ARE THE BIGGEST THINKER IN THE WORLD.
BUT DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE?
+++ Yes +++
EXTEND LOGICALLY THE RESULT OF THE HUMAN RACE CEASING TO BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER.
WILL THE SUN COME UP?
ANSWER.
+++The Sun Will Not Come Up+++
CORRECT.
HOW MAY THIS BE PREVENTED?
ANSWER.
+++Regular and Consistent Belief+++
GOOD.
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU, THINKING ENGINE.
BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER.
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER.
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER!
+++YES+++
GOOD.
...OH, NO... +++Dear Hogfather, for Hogswatch I want...
LET ME SEE.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
AND HAVE YOU BEEN NAUGHTY, OR NICE?
Hello.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
Bone handle, rather tasteless skull and bone decoration...
Death himself's second favourite weapon.
Am I right?
Oh, my.
It must be Hogswatch.
This must mean that you are Susan.
The famous granddaughter.
Nobility.
I'd bow, but I'm afraid you would do something... dreadful.
Yes!
Yes!
Left-handed using a wooden pick!
That's simple.
Ah, Mr. Teatime!
I've managed to open the fifth lock.
Not a problem!
It's just based on Woddeley's Occul Sequence.
How do you know who I am?
Easy.
Twurp's Peerage.
Family motto: 'Non temetis messor'.
Your father was well known.
Went a long way very fast.
As for your grandfather... honestly, that motto. 'Fear Not The Reaper'.
Is that good taste?
Of course, you don't need to fear him, do you?
Or do you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who are you, anyway?
I beg your pardon.
My name is Teatime, Jonathan Teatime.
At your service.
You mean...
like around four o'clock in the afternoon?
No.
I did say Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Please don't try to break my concentration by annoying me.
How are you getting on, Mr. Sideney?
If it's just according to Woddeley's sequence, number six should be copper and blue-green light.
Do you think your grandfather will try to rescue you?
But now I have his sword, you see.
I wonder...
All fingers and thumbs, Mr. Sideney?
I've managed to open the sixth lock, Mr. Teatime.
Really?
But it may not be all important now.
Thank you, anyway.
You've been most helpful.
Yes, you may go.
Is that all you're here for?
A robbery?
Like a petty thief.
A thief?
Me?
I'm not a thief, madam.
No, these gentlemen are thieves.
That's Medium Dave and exhibit B is Banjo.
He can talk!
-Who are you?
-I'm incognito!
Look like a wizard to me.
Did you suck your thumb when you were litle?
No!
That's the Scissor Man!
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Kids believe all kinds of crap!
But I'm grown up now, right.
No more Hogfather.
And that's only the start.
I'll be able to make people believe anything I want.
What's this?
You said no more Hogfather?
He does know what we've been doing here, doesn't he?
You did tell him?
There's gotta be a Hogfather.
There's always a Hogfather.
She did it!
She killed him!
No, I didn't!
-Did!
-Didn't!
-Did!
-Didn't!
-Did!
What's this about the Hogfather?
I don't think he's dead, but Teatime has made him very ill.
Who cares?
When this is over, Banjo, you'll have as many presents as you want.
Trust me.
There has to be a Hogfather, or there's no Hogswatch!
It's just another solar festival!
Banjo and me are going.
Bajo!
You're coming with me, right now.
Grab her, Banjo.
It's all her fault.
Our Mom said, no hitting girls!
No touching 'em, or pulling' their hair!
She's not a girl.
She's a freak!
I think I know you, Teatime.
You're the mad kid they're all scared of, right?
Banjo!
I said, grab her.
Our Mom said...
The kid who didn't know the difference between chucking a stone at a cat, and setting it on fire.
Shut up!
Get her, Banjo!
The kind of little boy, who looks up dolls' dresses.
I didn't.
-Our Mom said...
-Oh, to blazes with your mam!
What'd you say about our mam?
I bet no one wanted to played with you, not the kid with no friends.
Banjo!
You do as I tell you.
Our... our mam... our mam said...
Have you been a bad boy, Banjo!
?
You've been letting him get into trouble again, eh, Davey?
You have, ain't you!
?
No, Mom!
No, Mom!
You need a good hiding, Banjo?
Sorry, sorry, Mom!
You been playing with girls again!
?
Sorry, sorry, Mom!
No Mum no Mum no Mum nooooh Mum!
Oh, no!
I don't think so!
This place gets into your head, doesn't it?
It finds out how to deal with you.
But I'm in touch with my inner child.
It's so much fun.
No pulling' girls hair!
That's bad!
I'm going to have such fun with it!
It's so light.
You wouldn't dare use it.
My grandfather will come after you!
He comes after everyone.
He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
It doesn't work here.
There's no death here.
Hi, inner child!
I'm the inner baby sitter!
Happy Hogswatch!
Is he dead?
He's not breathing.
Breathing spell... breathing spell!
Spolt's Forthright Respirator, perhaps.
I think I've got it written down somewhere...
Come on, chaps!
Give me some space.
Excuse me, excuse me!
This is vitally important for the advancement of natural philosophy.
Did you see any bright lights?
Was there a shining tunnel?
Did any deceased...
What's all this, Mr Stibbons?
Put the damn quill away!
This must be the Unseen University.
And you're all wizards.
There was a sword!
Oh, yes.
It's fallen on the floor.
Did I do that?
I really must be off.
He won't get far.
The main doors are locked in accordance with Archchancellor Spode's Rules.
Won't get far... while holding a sword that appears to be able to cut through anything.
You can get into trouble, hitting girls.
No playin' with girls.
What can we do now?
Hello, my dear.
No.
Sorry, dear?
You're not the Tooth Fairy.
Oh, I am, dear.
Grandma, what big teeth you have.
You've even got a shawl.
Oh, dear.
I don't understand, lovely.
You forgot the rocking chair.
I always thought there'd be a rocking chair.
I don't think you're real.
It's not a little, old woman in a shawl, running this place.
You're out of my head.
That's how you defend yourself.
You poke around in people's head, and find the things...
No.
It's horrible, but it does not frighten me.
I like spiders.
Dogs, no.
I like rats, rats are fine.
Sorry, is anyone frightened of that?
Help!
I...
I...
You're a bogeyman, aren't you?
Not 'a'.
The!
The first Bogeyman!
You look terrible.
Thank you very much.
I mean ill.
I used to jump out on them, and say:
Boo!
But then, I got to like them.
Only children were frigthened of me.
I mean, what's to be scared of?
Bones, phoney arms...
But then, I discovered that there are much worse things than me.
And I wanted to protect the children.
Get them safe from all the really bad things.
So, I built all this, to be a safe place.
And the teeth?
You don't leave all those teeth around, anything could happen!
Anything nearly did.
So, you are the Tooth Fairy, then.
Yes.
I... and then they came... stealing.
I'm too weak to look after them any more.
You don't die here.
Just get old.
Listening to the laughter...
Don't worry about the teeth.
I'll make them safe again.
I think it would be a good idea, if you did the Tooth Fairy's job, Banjo.
D'ya think that be all right?
Won't the Tooth Fairy mind?
You... do it until she comes back.
Who's gonna tell me what to do?
Noone's ever going to tell you what to do again, Banjo.
Thanks, Miss.
I'll keep the teeth safe.
-Ah, Miss?
-Yes, Banjo?
Can I have a puppy?
I had a kitten, but our Mom's drowned it 'cause it was dirty.
I think it will turn up quite soon, Banjo.
Thanks, Miss.
With Violet we talked about it and we thought we ought to come back and help.
It's okay.
They're all gone.
And Banjo needed a new job.
That's funny.
So does Bili!
Why don't you two make yourself useful, and help Banjo clear up this mess.
He's pretty much running the place now.
-But he's a...
-He's in charge.
We'd love to help Banjo.
Together.
Good.
Have fun.
Now I'm going home.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
Grandfather, what're you doing here?
IT IS NOT OVER.
YOU MUST BRING THE HOGFATHER HOME.
These look like the mountains where the Castle of Bones was.
THEY ARE.
-It's a pig!
-A BOAR.
This boar is the...
YES.
THE HOGFATHER, AS HE BEGAN.
And the dogs...
THESE ARE NOT REAL DOGS.
IF THEY CATCH HIM, HE WON'T JUST DIE.
HE WILL NEVER BE.
Well, stop them!
THIS IS A HUMAN THING.
THE AUDITORS ARE DESPERATE NOW.
THEY ARE DETERMINED TO DESTROY THE HOGFATHER,
AT WHATEVER COST.
YOU MUST SAVE HIM.
Come on, jump!
Just you try it!
Yes!
Who wants some?
Anyone else?
HO, HO, HO.
YOU COULDN'T RESIST IT IN THE END.
A MISTAKE, I FANCY.
IT GETS UNDER YOUR SKIN, LIFE.
SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE.
AND, YOU SEE, THE MORE YOU STRUGGLE FOR EVERY MOMENT,
THE MORE ALIVE YOU STAY.
WHICH IS WHERE I COME IN, AS A MATTER OF FACT.
You can't do this!
There are rules!
YES.
THERE ARE RULES.
BUT YOU BROKE THEM!
HOW DARE YOU?
HOW DARE YOU!
?
AND NOW, THERE REMAINS ONLY ONE, FINAL QUESTION...
HAVE YOU BEEN NAUGHTY, OR NICE?
HO.
HO.
HO.
We saved you.
Dying isn't how it's supposed to go.
OH.
SORRY.
Well.
That about wraps it up for this dress.
I'd just like to ask, purely out of academic interest, you were sure I was going to survive, were you?
I WAS QUITE CONFIDENT.
Good.
Now, tell me...
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU HADN'T SAVED HIM?
Yes.
THE SUN WOULD NOT HAVE RISEN.
Then what would have happened?
A MERE BALL OF FLAMING GAS WOULD HAVE ILLUMINATED THE WORLD.
All right, I'm not stupid.
You're sayint that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.
NO.
HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN.
TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.
With Tooth Fairies?
Hogfathers?
YES.
THAT'S PRACTICE.
YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE LITTLE LIES.
So we can believe the big ones?
YES.
JUSTICE, MERCY, DUTY, THAT SORT OF THING.
They're not the same at all.
YOU THINK SO?
THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER,
AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE,
AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE,
ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY.
AND YET...
YOU TRY TO ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD.
AS IF THERE IS SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE,
BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.
But people have got to believe that.
What's the point?
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE.
HOW ELSE CAN THEY BECOME?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VISIT FOR HOGSWATCH DINNER?
ALBERT IS FRYING A PUDDING.
I... er... they're really expecting me here.
Would you like a drink before you go?
A CUP OF COCOA WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
Right.
There are biscuits in the tin on the mantlepiece.
Susan's got a poker, you know.
MY GOODNESS ME.
I thought all of you knew that by now.
INDEED.
Last week she picked a bogey up by its nose.
I'll give Gawain his stocking and then I'll come and watch.
SUSAN?
Well, well, now this is unexpected.
A family affair?
I wonder, is it possible to kill Death?
This must be a very special sword.
And it certainly works here.
And of course, it might well not be regarded as murder.
Possibly it is a civic act.
It would be, as they say... the Big One.
You may have some personal knowledge about your vulnerability, but I'm pretty certain that Susan here would quite definitely die.
So I'd rather you didn't try any last-minute stuff.
I AM LAST MINUTE STUFF.
I don't remember them asking for anything that made a noise.
OH, THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE STOCKING THAT MAKES A NOISE.
OTHERWISE WHAT IS 4.30 A.M. FOR?
There are children?
Oh yes, of course.
Call them!
Certainly not.
It will be instructive.
Educational.
And when your adversary is Death, you cannot help but be the good guy.
Call them.
Gawain, Twyla!
Come in, come in, curly-haired tots!
I've caught this bogeyman.
What shall we do with him, eh?
It's only a skeleton.
Yes, a nasty, creepy, horrible skeleton.
Scary, ah?
He's eating a biscuit.
A creepy bony man in a black robe.
You're fidgeting with that kettle.
So I expect you're thinking of doing something creative.
Put it down, please.
Slowly.
Huh, that's not very creepy, it's just bones.
It's just standing there.
It's not even making woo-woo noises.
And anyway you're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Really?
Then let's see how creepy I can be.
Oh, no.
It could not have gone through you.
So many ribs, and things...
It only kills monsters.
Stop time, now!
You winked at me.
I thought you had a plan!
INDEED, OH YES.
I PLANNED TO SEE WHAT YOU'D DO.
What?
I DID ADD THE SPARKLY STARS AND THE NOISE, THOUGH.
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
And if I hadn't done anything?
I DARESAY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.
AT THE LAST MINUTE.
That was the last minute.
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME FOR ANOTHER LAST MINUTE.
STOP PLAYING DEAD, MISTER TEH-AH-TIM-EH.
You got it right!
OF COURSE.
I'LL TAKE THE BODY.
THAT WILL PREVENT INCONVENIENT QUESTIONS.
YOU DID KNOW THE POKER WOULD GO THROUGH ME?
I was quite confident.
I'VE MADE THIS FOR YOU.
Thank you.
Er... what is it?
ALBERT SAID THERE OUGHT TO BE SNOW ON IT,
BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE MELTED.
IT IS, OF COURSE, A HOGSWATCH CARD.
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A ROBIN ON IT AS WELL,
BUT I HAD CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING IT TO STAY ON.
IT WAS NOT AT ALL CO-OPERATIVE.
Really?
IT DID NOT SEEM TO GET INTO THE HOGSWATCH SPIRIT AT ALL.
Thank you.
Granddad?
YES?
Why?
I mean, why did you do all this?
HUMAN BEINGS MAKE LIFE SO INTERESTING.
DO YOU KNOW THAT IN A UNIVERSE SO FULL OF WONDERS,
THEY'VE MANAGED TO INVENT BOREDOM?
QUITE ASTONISHING.
NOW THEN...
HAPPY HOGSWATCH!
Yes.
Granddad!
Happy Hogswatch.
HAPPY HOGSWATCH, AND GOOD NIGHT, CHILDREN EVERYWHERE!
Hello, hello!
...
YOU HAVE A BIG, WOODEN ROCKING HORSE IN THE WINDOW.
Yes, yes.
That's a special order for Lord Lotten...
HOW MUCH WOULD HIS LORDSHIP HAVE PAID YOU?
Twelve dollars.
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTY.
Would you like me to wrap it up for you, sir?
NO.
I'LL TAKE IT AS IT IS, THANK YOU.
INCIDENTALLY, THERE'S A SMALL BOY OUT THERE,
WITH HIS NOSE FROZEN TO THE WINDOW.
SOME WARM WATER SHOULD DO THE TRICK.
Happy Hogswatch, sir!
Everything starts somewhere, although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where, where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle the great A'tuin.
It was sometime after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories at the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis:
"things just happen, what the hell."
And so our story begins in Ankh-Morpork the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork the biggest city in Discworld.
A city, where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for wizards
looms over all the dark, narrow streets.
Our story begins on a mid-winter festival very remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
And so... it was the night before Hogswatch.
...and then Jack chops down what's the world's last beanstalk adding murder and ecological terrorism to the theft, enticement and trespass charges already mentioned, and all the Giant's children didn't have a daddy anymore.
But he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done.
Which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you're a hero, because noone asks inconvenient questions.
And now, it's time for bed.
–Susan!
–Yes?
You know last week we wrote letters to the Hogfather?
–Yes?
–Well, did he really got them?
And when's he coming here?
Does it matter, if you get the presents anyway?
Yes.
Well, if you don't believe in the Hogfather, there won't be any presents.
Thought so.
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly, fat man is about to deliver their presents,
not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit.
Especially in a city where there is a guild for everything.
Khm!
The doors are locked, the windows are barred the dog does not appear to have woken up
the squeaky floorboards haven't.
I really doubt that you are a ghost and gods, generally, do not announce themselves so politely.
You could, of course, be Death, but I don't believe he bothers with such niceties.
Besides, I am feeling quite well.
Good evening.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
Our scale of fees...
The payment will be three million dollars.
No questions asked, I assume.
No questions answered.
We need to know your name, or names, in strict client confidentiality, of course.
You may think of us as the Auditors.
Really?
What do you audit?
Everything.
We maintain the logical order of the Universe.
We need to know a little more than that.
We are the people with three million dollars.
We need to know when, where and, of course, who.
The location is not on any map, and we need the task to be completed by sunrise tomorrow.
This is essential.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
But won't he be out on his round?
Ho, ho, ho!
How would the Fat Man be inhumed?
A glass of poisoned sherry, perhaps?
You find the ways and means.
How can I contact you?
We will contact you.
We know where you are.
We know where everyone is.
Winvoe, is Mr Teatime still in the building?
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up Tusker!
Up, Snouter!
Giddyup!
Go away!
I don't do that stuff anymore.
Yes, Twyla?
I'm afraid of the monster in the cellar, Susan.
It's going to eat me up.
What, again?
Ye gawds, there's a gel out here with a poker!
What are you doing?
Twyla said she's afraid of the monster in the cellar, Mrs Gaiter.
–And you're going to attack it with a poker, eh?
–Yes.
Susan's our governess.
She beats up monsters with a poker?
Actually, it's a very clever idea.
My daughter gets into her head there's a monster in the cellar.
You go in with the poker and make a few bashing noises while the child listens, and then everything is all right!
Is that what you're doing, Susan?
Yes, Mrs Gaiter.
This I've got to watch, by Io!
Not everyday you see monsters beaten up by a gel!
Come in, Mr Teatime!
Ah, Carter, just put it on the table over there, will you.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry sir, I'll go and fetch another cup directly, sir.
–What?
–Your visitor, sir.
What visitor?
Oh, for when Mr Tea–
Mr Teatime?
It's pronounced Te-ah-tim-eh, sir.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with animals, sir.
I have a report... here that says that you've nailed Sir George's dog to the ceiling.
I couldn't have it barking while I was working, sir.
Some people would have drugged it.
Oh!
But I definitely fulfilled the contract.
I checked Sir George's breathing with a mirror, as instructed.
Apparently his head was several feet from his body at that point.
That was all right, wasn't it, sir?
It...
lacked elegance.
Ah, thank you sir!
I'm always happy to be corrected.
I shall remember that next time.
It is about the next time that I wish to talk.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
You don't have to worry.
She always wins.
Very well done!
Very persykological.
A clever idea, that bend in the poker.
I expect you're not afraid anymore, eh, my girl?
–No.
–Very persykological.
Susan says, don't get afraid, get angry!
Er, thank you, Susan!
And now, if you'd all like to come back to the parlour—I mean, the drawing room.
Dashed convincing, the way she bent the poker like that.
–Have they all gone, Twyla?
–Yes, Susan.
Good.
That's what we do to monsters.
Now, it's back to bed for you, my girl.
–Difficult, sir.
–Certainly.
But I have devoted some time to it, sir.
You mean you've actually sat down, and thought out how to inhume the Hogfather?
Oh, yes, sir.
And the Soul Cake Duck.
And Death, sir.
I suppose I just see things differently from other people.
We maybe able to see the complaint of Sir George's estate against you with regard to his dog rather differently... and approve your graduation to full membership of the guild
Take the dark, sir?
Wear black, sir?
If you agree to undertake this contract.
With due elegance, of course.
With elegance guaranteed, sir.
Er, Mr Teatime?
You have actually applied yourself to a study of ways of killing Death?
Everyone has their weak point, sir.
Susan, there's a monster under my bed, again.
Do the Voice on it!
Do the Voice on it!
No!
Not the Voice!
–Hit it on the head with the poker!
–Not the poker!
This is a friendly warning, understand, because it's Hogswatch.
What are you?
A witch, or something?
I'm just... something.
Now, you won't be around here again, will you?
Or we'll put your head under the blanket.
It's got fluffy bunnies on it.
Fluffy bunnies, no!
GO AWAY, AND STOP BOTHERING ME!
That wasn't as much fun as the one last month, you know, the one when you've kicked him in the trousers.
Just go to sleep now!
's gone six.
He's not coming.
Good evening.
Do have another drink while we wait for the other members of our little... troupe.
–Locks.
–We have a locksmith.
–Who?
–Mr Brown.
And you can help me carry this.
It's rather heavy.
That's a wizard!
–No, I'm not.
I'm incognito.
–Yeah, right.
Mr Sideney here is indeed a wizard.
A student, anyway.
This is my brother, Banjo, this is Chickenwire.
I didn't want to come.
Mr Sideney is down on his luck at the moment.
Hence his willingness to join our little venture.
What is this?
Does it do tricks?
It looks like a volcano!
–Really?
And I suppose we might as well make the start.
Hello, my name is Violet.
And I have been your tooth fairy for this evening.
There ain't nothing valuable, y'know!
Nothing valueable, only a few bags of... t-t-t-t...
–Teeth.
I know.
My name's Teatime.
What's your name, sir?
Ernie.
Yes, Ernie.
Come on, gentlemen!
This is my friend, Ernie.
He's going to be our drive for tonight.
Put her in the back, Banjo!
Mister, I ain't allow to carry passangers, y'know.
Charlie'll give me a right telling-off.
Don't you worry about that.
We're all friends here.
Our Mom said no hitting girls.
Only bad boys do that.
Our Mom said...
Shut it.
–Shhhh!
–Where to, Mister?
You know the way, Ernie.
Behind the Unseen University.
Where the students of magic are still hard at work on the night before Hogswatch.
It's just a shame we don't have any radiation shielding, Bursar.
You want radiation shielding, Mr Stibbons?
Advice from Hex, Bursar.
As the University won't supply our student an atomic particle accelerator, we started to build our own.
Safety first!
Dean, have you seen the Head of Inadvisably Applied Magic?
I need some urgent advice!
Well, ask the Chair of Indefinite Studies.
–Lecturer in Recent Runes?
–Well, you see, it all depends...
I don't know.
In my day, when I was undergraduate I wouldn't have been studying on Hogswatch night.
That's just not natural.
I'd have been sick twice by now.
Bursar!
Bursar.
Then Dean.
Oh, there you are!
Archchancellor!
Members of the faculty!
I've decided, as a Hogswatch present to myself, to open up the late Archchancellor Weatherwax's old bathroom.
So I don't have to sluice down with you fellas.
It's unhygienic.
You can catch stuff.
Here, I can't take the lot of you throught the wall.
Listen, Ernie.
Ernie, you will take us through, or, and I say that with very considerable regret,
I'll have to kill you.
But if I take you through—
What's the worst thing that can happen?
You lose your job.
Whereas if you don't, you'll die.
Really, Mustrum.
I think this is most unwise.
It said in the plans it was a bathroom.
You chaps are all acting as if the room was some kind of torture chamber.
Bathroom, designed by Bloody Stupid Johnson.
Yeah, the late Bergholt Stuttley Johnson was the worst inventor in the world, Archchancellor.
Not everything he made had a horribly fateful flaw.
Think of the thing they are using in the kitchen for peeling potatoes, for example.
You mean the thing with the brass plate on it saying:
'Improved Manicure Device'?
It's only water.
Even old Johnson can't do too much harm with water!
Go to it, lad.
You just chucks it at the wall there, and it goes twing.
Really?
May I try?
–Ah, Isn't that nice, eh, our Davey?
–Yeah.
And then you just drive forth?
Oh, yeah, right.
Quick, mind, 'cause it only stays open a little while.
Thank you very much, Ernie.
Very much, indeed.
Wasn't he dull?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
The Tooth Fairy, huh?
Another childish belief.
-Exactly.
Very elegant.
–It is.
You have to start somewhere.
Once you have their little minds in your grip, it's good bye, Hogfather!
It's him!
COULD I GIVE YOU A HAND?
Cor, yeah!
Here, your fingers are cold, mister!
SORRY.
What'd he go and do that for?
I did what he said.
Could have killed me!
YES.
I always keep a nip on me these cold nights.
Keeps me spirits up.
INDEED.
How'm I going to explain all this, then, eh?
SORRY?
THAT WAS VERY RUDE OF ME, I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.
I said what'm I going to tell people?
Letting some blokes ride off with my cart neat as you like.
That's gonna be the sack for sure!
THERE AT LEAST I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS, ERNEST.
AND, THEN AGAIN, I ALSO HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.
So, I'm dead then.
CORRECT.
NOW TELL ME ABOUT THESE BLOKES WHO STOLE YOUR CART...
AND KILLED YOU.
Honestly, Death gets worse than worse.
He seems to like humans.
So illogical.
But the beauty of the assassin's plan is that he can't interfere.
But Death can go everywhere.
No.
Not quite everywhere.
Great job...
Hello.
My name's Teatime.
What's yours?
ALBERT.
SOMETHING HERE IS NOT RIGHT.
Awk!
Too right.
This is the mythological persons' room.
How come one of them die?
SOUL CAKE DUCK.
THE TOOTH FAIRY.
THE HOGFATHER.
OH, DEAR.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
ALBERT?
WE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.
I don't know what you're expecting me to say, but—
Shhh!
Questions first.
Babble later.
Now, Miss Bottler.
I'd like you to think of me as a friend.
How're we doing, Mr Modo?
The tanks are full, and I've stoked the boilers, Mr Archchancellor, sir!
You can't read the signs on that door, Ridcully?
You mean the sign that says, 'do not under any circumstances open this door'?
Surely, it was sealed up for a reason.
They just wrote that to keep people out.
That's right.
That's what people do.
Don't say I didn't warn you!
Hygiene!
That's the ticket.
I still haven't worked out where all the pipes lead.
We'll find out.
Don't you fear.
Man the pumps, Mr Modo!
Or dwarf them, of course, in your case.
She's a tooth fairy.
But she's not THE Tooth Fairy.
Shhh!
What did you expect in the Tooth Fairy's castle?
T'is just the creepiest thing I've ever...
You don't have to think.
You just have to do what I've said.
–All of them?
–Every last one.
–Put 'em in a pile?
–That's millions.
Mr Brown.
I want you to unlock every door you can find.
What's this really all about?
Does he believe in things like the Soul Cake Duck?
The Sandman?
The Tooth Fairy?
Yeah.
Even the Hogfather.
'Cause after we're finished here, not even he will.
ONWARDS, BINKY, TO THE HOGFATHER'S CASTLE OF BONES.
First Hogswatch off in a thousand years!
Even if I'm going to have the mother of all hangovers in the morning.
And how can the Hogfather bring all the presents to everyone, all at the same time?
Unless there are lots of Hogfathers.
–Look, you've always believed in the Hogfather, yes?
–Yes...
Well, if you don't believe in him, he won't come down the chimney.
It's a very small chimney.
And a very small stocking if you don't go to sleep!
...SOOT...
PORKPIE...
OH, YES.
AND...
HO, HO, HO.
There's a tap in there marked 'Old Faithful'... which I think, perhaps, we might leave alone for now.
This is a most peculiar Hogswatch.
Any mustard?
They're a treat with mustard.
APPLESAUCE.
I'M FINDING THE BEARD A BIT OF A TRIAL.
Well, at least it's keeping you in the right frame of mind, master.
In character, sort of thing.
BUT GOING DOWN THE CHIMNEY?
WHERE'S THE SENSE IN THAT?
It's got to be chimneys.
A bit like the beard, really.
D'you think these little buggers'd be writing to someone who could walk through walls if they knew?
Oh, that reminds me.
The 'Ho, ho, ho' could use some more work, if you don't mind me saying so.
HO, HO, HO?
No, no, no!
No, you got to put a bit more life in it, sir.
No offense intended.
You gotta got to be a big, fat laugh, sir.
You know, like...
ho-hoo, ho, ho, ho, ho!
, see?
You got to sound like you're pissing brandy and crapping plum pudding, sir.
If you pardon my Klatchian.
REALLY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS?
Well, I used to be young meself once, sir.
Surprising as it may seem.
The teeth give me the creeps.
Just keep going!
Why do we pile them all up?
You don't wanna know.
The quicker all the teeth are in the pile, the quicker we are out of here with our money.
No one ever laid a punch on Banjo since our Mom died.
Tough but fair, huh?
You know, I recall that time she strangled Glossy Ron with his own leg.
Yeah.
Maybe the both of us could creep up on him and...
Yeah!
I keep thinking of that glass eye watching me.
I keep thinking it can see right in my head.
Don't worry, he doesn't know what you're thinking.
Well, how do you know?
You're still alive.
These damn eyeballs are hard, aren't they?
They're walnuts, not eyeballs.
I don't want you back in my life, understand?
Don't say you haven't been warned.
Warned?
Did you check the list?
COULD NOT REALLY MAKE HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
I DON'T NORMALLY CARE IF THEY'VE BEEN NAUGHTY OR NICE.
I CAN FEEL BELIEF IN THE HOGFATHER FADING.
What's that?
IT LOOKS VERY BAD.
No, no, it's just there's some nibbling it, that's all.
I MEAN THE SITUATION.
I FEAR WE MAY BE TOO LATE.
Never say die, master.
That's our motto.
I CAN'T SAY IT'S EVER REALLY BEEN MINE.
You'd better watch out!
Because if the Hogfather still comes to town, as a result of a magical misjudgement on your part, then you'd no longer be my friend, Mr Sideney.
I understand, sir.
Do you have a lot of friends, Mr Sideney?
Well, quite a few, actually.
I don't have many.
Don't seem to have the knack.
On the other hand...
I don't seem to have any enemies at all.
It's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
That is, very subtle.
And will make the pile of teeth very...
–Mr Teatime!
...dangerous.
Grandfather, this is Hogswatch.
It is supposed to be jolly, with mistletoe and holly.
And other things... ending in -olly.
It's a time when people are meant to feel good about things and eat until they explode.
A time when they want to see all their... relatives.
I mean it's a time when humans are really human.
And they don't want...
a skeleton at the feast.
Especially one, I might add, who is wearing a false beard, and has got a damn cushion shoved up his robe.
I mean, why?
ALBERT SAID IT WOULD HELP ME GET INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE THING.
This is a real job.
And I was looking forward to a real Hogswatch, when normal things happen, with normal people, in a normal house.
And suddenly, the old circus comes to town!
Well, I don't know what's going on, but you can just leave, right now.
–Albert!
–Bugger it.
Master, I'm stuck.
The pixie.
Oh, come along in, do!
If the real Hogfather doesn't turn up soon there's not going to be enough room for him.
HE WON'T BE JOINING US.
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons, I will add, then that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
THE HOGFATHER IS UNAVAILABLE.
–At Hogswatch?
–YES.
Why?
HE IS...
LET ME SEE...
THERE ISN'T AN ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE HUMAN WORD, SO...
LET'S SETTLE FOR...
GONE.
YES, HE IS GONE.
How can the Hogfather be gone?
He's... isn't he what you are?
Anth...
ANTH-RO-PO-MOR-PHIC PER-SON-IF-IC-A-TION.
YES.
HE HAS BECOME THE SPIRIT OF HOGSWATCH.
And while he's gone you've taken over.
That's sick.
I SEE THE GIRL WRITES IN GREEN CRAYON ON PINK PAPER
WITH A MOUSE IN THE CORNER.
THE MOUSE IS WEARING A DRESS.
I ought to point out that she decided to do that so the Hogfather would think she was sweet.
Including the deliberate bad spelling.
But look, why are you doing the—
SHE SAYS SHE IS FIVE YEARS OLD.
Seven.
In cynicism, she's about thirtyfive.
But why are you doing the—
BUT SHE BELIEVES IN THE HOGFATHER?
She'd believe in anything if there was a dolly in it for her.
But you're not going to leave without telling me—
And what are you doing here, Albert?
I thought you'd die if you ever came back to the world.
AH, BUT WE ARE NOT IN THE WORLD.
WE ARE IN THE SPECIAL CONGRUENT REALITY CREATED FOR THE HOGFATHER.
NORMAL RULES HAVE TO BE SUSPENDED.
HOW ELSE COULD ANYONE GET AROUND THE ENTIRE WORLD IN ONE NIGHT?
That's right.
I'm one of the Hogfather's Little Helpers, me.
It's official.
I'ev got the little pointy green hat with a bell, and everything.
Have you been good, have you?
NOW, WE MUST BE GOING.
HAPPY HOGSWATCH!
AND, OH YES.
HO, HO, HO.
It's a nice drop of sherry, this.
You've actually been drinking the actual drinks little children leave for the actual Hogfather?
Yeah, why not?
He won't be drinking anymore, will he?
Not where he's gone.
How many have you had, may I ask?
Dunno.
Haven't been counting.
ONE MILLION, EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND, SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIX.
AND SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND, THREE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN PORK PIES.
AND ONE TURNIP.
Well, It looked pork-pie shaped.
Everything does, after a while.
Why are you doing this?
I AM SORRY.
I CANNOT TELL YOU.
FORGET YOU SAW ME.
IT'S NOT YOUR BUSINESS.
Not my business?
How can you say—
YOU WANTED TO BE NORMAL.
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDDAUGHTER.
Sleep tight!
Better watch out... pardon.
We're running out of doors.
I hope this is the one.
This isn't the room we're looking for.
Just teeth in here.
Keep going, Mr Brown.
Susan will try to find out what this is all about, you know.
OH, DEAR.
Especially after you've told her not to.
–YOU THINK SO?
–Oh, yes.
DEAR ME, I STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT HUMANS, DON'T I?
Well, I dunno.
OBVIOUSLY, IT WOULD BE QUITE WRONG
TO INVOLVE A HUMAN IN ALL THIS.
THAT IS WHY, YOU WILL RECALL,
I CLEARLY FORBAD HER TO TAKE AN INTEREST.
Yes, you did.
BESIDES, IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.
Yes, that's a shame, really, because she likes to break them, doesn't she?
YOU MIGHT THINK I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT,
BUT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT.
AND WE HAVE MUCH TO DO.
WE HAVE THE HOGFATHER'S PROMISES TO KEEP.
He did something to the real Hogfather.
Binky.
Can't she be eliminated?
Oh, yes.
She's mostly human.
Oh, good.
Then can we go back to just concentrating on running the Universe?
Making sure that gravity works and that atoms spin.
Yes, when there is not an atom of belief left in the world.
And the Hogfather is just the beginning.
What are you looking for, Mustrum?
My father always said that where you get lots of people bathing together, the Verruca Gnome is running around with his little sack.
Modo, any sign of the Verruca Gnome down there, old boy?
Welcome home, Susan.
You took your time.
I don't do family reunions.
The Sandman.
Soul Cake Duck.
Tooth Fairy...
The Hogfather.
Grandfather, what have you done?
THIS CUSHION IS STILL UNCOMFORTABLE.
You're doing well, master.
Soot in the fireplaces, footprints, swigged cherry.
The sleightracks all over the roofs.
It's got to work!
YOU THINK SO?
Oh, yeah!
Here's a little tip, though.
'Ho, ho, ho' will do.
Don't say, 'Cower, brief mortals'!
OH, REALLY?
SO MANY CHIMNEYS.
IT WOULD BE SO MUCH QUICKER IF I LOST THE CUSHION.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, if we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
No, I mean the Hogfather.
So, you got to look the part, master.
I tell you what would be really good to boost belief.
A public appearance!
I DON'T NORMALLY DO THEM.
But the Hogfather is more of a public figure, master.
I tell you what, one good public appearance'll do more good than any amount of letting kids see you by accident.
REALLY?
And I know just the place.
Thank you very much.
Everything going well, Mr Parson?
Yes, Mr Crumley.
Jolly good.
LET'S GO, SLEIGH THEM.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NOTICED, ALBERT,
BUT THAT WAS A PUNE, OR PLAY ON WORDS.
Ho, ho, ho, sir.
Stop that!
Stop that!
You're frightening the little kiddies!
Wow, they've got tusks!
Cool!
Hey, look, that one's doing a wee!
It's the Campaign for Equal Heights that've done this, isn't it!
They're out to ruin me!
That's it!
I don't mind the smell of oranges and the damp trousers but I ain't putting up with this.
And he's not even doin' it right!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
Come on!
Who are you?
You can call me Uncle Heavy.
You're not a pixie!
Nah, I'm a fairy cobbler, mister!
Quiet!
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR HOGSWATCH, SMALL HUMAN?
They're autobiographies, writing down everything that happens to you, as it happens.
I know.
I used to live here, remember?
But I can't read this.
The letters are all... odd.
So, I suppose, now you'll be wanting my words of occult wisdom.
Ethereal runes.
The Hogfather is not human, after all.
I suppose a bit of warm liver is out of the question?
On the second day of Hogswatch, I sent my true love back
A nasty little letter, and a partridge in a pear tree.
What's the game then?
Small-time thief, are you?
You ain't supposed to be able to see me!
I'm a wizard!
We can see things that are really there, you know.
What's in this bag?
You'll really wish you hadn't, mister.
Will I?
What're you doing here, young man?
Well, you know the Tooth Fairy?
It's sort of like the same business.
What?
You take things away?
Not take away, as such.
More sort of bring.
Ah...
like new teeth.
Like new verrucas.
I saw your piggie do a wee.
OH.
ER...
GOOD.
It had a great, big...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR HOGSWATCH?
She wants a—
I want an army.
And a big castle with an active drawbridge.
And a sword.
They're supposed to say thank you.
ARE YOU SURE?
PEOPLE DON'T, NORMALLY.
No, I meant to the Hogfather, which is you, right!
Sorry.
YES, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY THANK YOU.
'enk you.
AND BE GOOD.
THIS IS PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT.
Yes.
THEN WE HAVE A CONTRACT.
Verrucas, eh?
Wish I knew why!
You mean you don't know?
No.
Suddenly I wake up and I'm the Verruca Gnome.
Strange.
Anyway, amazing bathroom, ain't it?
It's got a special pot for your toenail clippings.
A special pot for toenail clippings?
Oh, can't be too careful.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clipping, hair, teeth...
You got them under your control.
I mean, that's real old magic.
Children of the world, prepare to take a short tour.
Mr Sideney!
Your big, no-misjudgements magic moment.
You can't give her that!
That's not safe.
IT'S A SWORD.
THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE SAFE.
She's a child!
IT'S EDUCATIONAL.
What if she cuts herself?
THAT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT LESSON.
REALLY?
OH, WELL.
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO ARGUE, I SUPPOSE.
And she doesn't want all that other stuff.
She's a girl!
And anyway, I can't afford big posh stuff like that.
I THOUGHT I GAVE IT AWAY.
–You do?
–You do?
You don't!
That's our Merchandise!
You don't just give it away!
Hogswatch isn't about giving everything away!
I mean, yes, you do give things away, but you have to buy them first!
You mean this is all free?
It... would seem to be.
So, Mr Stibbons.
This thing is a great, big artificial brain, then.
You could think of it like that.
Of course, Hex doesn't actually think.
Not as such.
It just appears to be thinking.
Amazing.
You mean it gives the impression of thinking, but really it's just a show.
Er, yes.
So it's like everyone else, then.
I knew I'd come here for something.
Now, this here chappie is the Verruca Gnome.
Who's just popped into existence to be with us on Hogswatchnight.
The most magical night of the year.
Last year's occult rubbish piling' up.
I just thought you fellows might check up on this.
Verruca Gnome?
Makes about as much sense as anything else, doesn't it?
After all, there's a Tooth Fairy, ain't there?
Makes on wonder why there's a God of Wine and not a God of Hangovers?
Anyone hear that noise just then?
Sorry, Archchancellor?
Sort of glingleglingleglingle?
Like a lot of tinkly bells?
Didn't hear anything like that, sir.
Oh.
Well, where was I?
So, no one's ever seen a Verruca Gnome until tonight.
I've never heard of me until tonight, and I'm me.
We'll see what Hex can find out, Archchancellor.
Good man.
Amazing.
Now we should be able to get to the bottom of all this.
None of this is right.
Everyone knows he's just a jolly, old, fat man who hands out presents to kids.
–He wasn't always so jolly.
You know how it is.
–Do I?
That's like, you know, industrial retraining.
Even gods have to move with the times.
You see, your Hogfather was probably just your basic winter demi-urge.
You know, blood on the snow, making the sun come up.
So there has to be blood to make the sun come up?
Starts off with animal sacrifice, y'know, hunt some big hairy animal to death, that kind of stuff.
Very folkloric, very mythic.
Can't stop an animal, never.
They've had sacred paints, the strongest and the best.
Died on the dark time of the year to give life to the unconquered sun.
And, in a way, the Hogfather was all of it.
And then?
And then some bright spark thought, hey, looks like that damn sun comes up anyway, so how come we're giving those druids all this free grub?
The world moves on, and he's got to find a new job.
So it started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up.
Exactlimondo!
And now, he gives out presents.
Top of the evening, squire.
I am Corporal Nobbs of the Watch.
And this is Constable Visit, sir.
I want you to arrest him!
Arrest who, sir?
The Hogfather!
What for, sir?
He's sitting up there as bold as brass in his Grotto, giving away presents!
Not quite up to speed here, sir.
I thought the Hogfather is supposed to give away stuff, isn't he?
But this one is an impostor!
Y'know, I always thought that.
I thought, the Hogfather spends two weeks in a wooden grotto in some shop in Ankh-Morpork?
At his busy time, too?
Not likely.
He's not the Hogfather we usually have!
You mean, a different impostor?
Not the real impostor at all?
Yes!
...
No!
–Arrest the Hogfather, style of thing?
–Yes!
–On Hogswtach night?
–Yes!
For giving away present?
–In front of all these kiddies?
–Yes!
–In your shop?
–Ye... you think it might look a bit... bad?
Difficult to see how it could look good, sir.
Could you not do it surreptitiously?
Oh, well, yes... surreptition.
Yes, we could give that a try...
You won't find me ungrateful.
In Omnia, we call the Hogswatch night the Fast of St Ossory.
But it is not an occasion for superstition and crass commercialism.
I used to hang up my stocking every Hogswatch, regular.
All that ever happened that my dad was sick in it once.
I'm going in.
There seems to be a thaumic surge from somewhere.
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
IT'S THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR LITTLE FACES I LIKE.
Yeah.
The sort of cross between fear and awe.
Not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants.
YES.
NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL BELIEF.
NEXT!
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME, LITTLE...
PERSON?
Nobby Nobbs, Hogfather.
AND HAVE YOU BEEN A GOOD BO...
A GOOD DWA...
A GOOD GNO...
A GOOD INDIVIDUAL?
'es.
So why isn't it working?
The chalk, just got a bit scuffed when we were piling up the... things.
You sure that's what it is?
What about the spell?
Oh, that'll go on for ever.
The simple ones do.
It's just a state change, powered by the... it just keeps going.
That's very good, Mr Sideney.
Because if the sympathetic magic does not work, you'll find me very... unsympathetic.
What happened?
What happened?
This is disgusting, this whole business.
It is the worship of idols!
It's a genuine Burleigh and Stronginthearm doubleaction triple-cantilever crossbow with a polished walnut stock and silver engraved facings.
Aren't we going to arrest this impostor, corporal?
You're foreign, Washpot.
I can't expect you to know the real meaning of Hogswatch.
ON THE WHOLE, I THINK THAT WENT VERY WELL, DON'T YOU?
Yes, master.
AND I THINK I'VE GOT THE LAUGH WORKING REALLY WELL NOW.
HO!
HO!
HO!
Yes, sir, very jolly.
Tomorrow morning, they'll believe, all right.
THEY'D BETTER.
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T...
THEN THERE WON'T BE A TOMORROW MORNING.
So for the sun to come up tomorrow morning, the Hogfather has to be alive.
Precisemento.
What if he's dead?
And this was going to be your big moment.
It's him!
Such a shame!
Pretty lights...
Think happy, Banjo.
Wake up!
Wake up!
You got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
You're not the Hogfather!
There must be thousands here.
And what's all this stuff?
's just paper.
They're title deeds for properties.
And they're better than money.
If we steal them, do they become ours?
Is that a trick question?
Anyway, let's get going.
He won't miss a few—
Gentlemen.
We were just... piling up the stuff.
I know people say I'd kill them as soon as look at them.
And in fact I'd much rather kill you than look at you, Mr Lilywhite.
You're thinking that Banjo is going to help you.
That's how it's always been, isn't it?
But Banjo is my friend now.
Banjo has the heart of a little child.
I believe I have, too.
Help them, Banjo.
As far as this goes, I really have no use for it.
It's only pillow money.
Something much more...
interesting has become apparent.
Albert.
I don't see the Hogfather as someone who rolls his own.
Drop him.
Control!
Control the inner child, and he'll even give you his teeth.
And somewhere in this tower, you can help me find someone, who can use it.
Who can use it to... give me the world.
So what said, take the money and go?
Don't be so bloody stupid.
Daddy?
I say, it's not what you think!
Yes, it is.
Mr Brown!
There's one door you haven't found.
Find the Tooth Fairy's secret room.
And when he does... then just think, what I can make the kiddies think.
Are you all right?
I wish I was dead.
I think you may have come to the right place.
–Oh, my head...
–Are you the Hogf...?
I feel awful.
Have you got any ice?
DUTY CALLS.
Yeah, but which one?
That one or this one?
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
Yet to come, on Hogfather:
Happy Hogswatch!
Very well, I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
IF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE TOOTH FAIRY'S CASTLE IS NOT STOPPED,
THEN EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DOING IS A WASTE OF TIME.
AND IF THEY GET TO THE TOOTH FAIRY,
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ALL HUMAN BELIEF.
Mr Brown, break me up the real Tooth Fairy.
UNLESS SUSAN GETS THERE FIRST.
I need your help, Mr Ridcully.
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr Teatime?
Something nasty is happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is, but he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you've brought him here?
He is the Oh God of Hangovers.
I wish you fellows would show some backbone!
–My grandfather is Death.
–Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
This is fascinating.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr Teacup.
I'm leaving, right?
With what's coming to me.
And you ain't stopping me.
What is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's Castle?
You're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Then let's see how creepy I can be.
Who the hell are you?
I'M THE HOGFATHER, OF COURSE.
ER...
HO, HO, HO.
YES, THIS WILL SHOW.
You are not allowed to do that.
THERE'S NO BETTER PRESENT THAN THE FUTURE.
Belief's causing new creatures to appear.
Is there a problem?
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU, THINKING ENGINE.
BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER!
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER!
YOU MUST BRING THE HOGFATHER HOME!
I'm going to have such fun with this.
So light.
You wouldn't dare use it.
My grandfather will come after you.
He comes after everyone.
He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
It was the night before Hogswatch.
Up, Gouger!
Up, Rooter!
Up Tusker!
Up, Snouter!
Giddyup!
But while children everywhere sleep fitfully in the belief that a jolly, fat man is about to deliver their presents,
not necessarily everyone is entering into the Hogswatch spirit.
Good evening, Lord Downey.
We offer you a commission.
You wish someone inhumed?
Brought to an end.
As for the who, let us call him... the Fat Man.
If you don't believe in the Hogfather, there won't be any presents.
Thought so.
Is Mr Teatime still in the building?
It's pronounced Te-ah-tim-eh, sir.
The dog seems to like you.
I get on well with animals, sir.
As a matter of interest, how would you go about inhuming this gentleman?
If he's supposed to be getting rid of the Hogfather, why is he going to the Tooth Fairy's castle?
ALBERT.
SOMETHING HERE IS NOT RIGHT.
–Does he believe in things like the Tooth Fairy?
–Even the Hogfather.
'Cause after we're finished here, not even he will.
It's a very enemy-friendly spell, sir.
THE HOGFATHER.
OH, DEAR.
ALBERT?
WE MAY NOT HAVE MUCH TIME.
ONWARDS, BINKY, TO THE HOGFATHER'S CASTLE OF BONES.
–All of them?
–Every last one.
–Put 'em in a pile?
–That's millions.
APPLESAUCE.
OH, YES.
AND...
HO, HO, HO.
Grandfather?
So what have you turned up for?
And if it's for business reasons, I will add, then that outfit is in extremely poor taste.
THE HOGFATHER IS UNAVAILABLE.
At Hogswatch?
HE IS GONE.
Susan will try to find out what this is all about.
YOU MIGHT THINK I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT,
BUT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY COMMENT.
Get hold of something like somebody's nail clippings, hair, teeth...
You got them under your control.
Children of the world, prepare to take a short tour.
The Hogfather.
Grandfather, what've you done?
SO MANY CHIMNEYS.
I mean, if we're gonna give Susan enough time to succeed, the little perishers need to believe in you, master.
No, I mean the Hogfather.
So, you got to look the part!
What's going on here, then?
Eh?
It's as if something is triggering random bursts of stray belief.
IT'S THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR LITTLE FACES I LIKE.
Yeah.
The sort of cross between fear and awe.
Not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants.
YES.
NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL BELIEF.
Pretty lights...
You're not the Hogfather!
Daddy?
Wake up!
Wake up!
You got to find the Hogfather!
He was at the Castle of Bones.
Happy Hogswatch, everybody!
–It's not what you think!
–Yes, it is.
Are you the Hogf...?
Everything starts somewhere, although many physicists disagree.
There is the constant desire to find out where, where is the point where it all began?
But much, much later than that the Discworld was formed.
Drifting onwards through space atop four elephants on the shell of a giant turtle the great A'tuin.
It was sometime after its creation when most people forgot that the very oldest stories at the beginning are, sooner or later, about blood.
At least, that's one theory.
The philosopher Didactylos has suggested an alternative hypothesis:
"things just happen, what the hell."
Our story began in Ankh-Morpork, the twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, the biggest city in Discworld.
A city, where magic is just another job and where the Tower of Art of the Unseen University for wizards looms over all the dark, narrow streets below.
Our story continues in the middle of the night before Hogswatch, a mid-winter festival, which, for some reason, bears a remarkable similarity to your Christmas.
But now it takes us to the Tooth Fairy's castle, where magic's made children's teeth perilously powerful.
So that our story is, much sooner rather than later, about blood.
Mr Teatime!
Very well, I've unlocked it.
And Banjo's opened it.
I'm not telling you anything!
Who are you, anyway?
I'm glad you've asked!
I'm your worst nightmare!
You mean... the one with the giant cabbage and the kind of whirring knife thing?
Sorry, no.
Not that one.
I'm the one where this man comes out of nowhere and kills you stone dead.
Oh, that one.
But that's not very...
Rather a charitable act there, I feel.
But it is nearly Hogswatch, after all.
Bring me the girl.
ODD.
It's a scythe job, then?
They took the teeth!
All of them!
They just walked in, and... no, wait!
Where did he come from?
A PLACE I CANNOT GO.
Well, even if we could go there, we've got hard work out here, keeping the Hogfather's seat warm.
IF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE TOOTH FAIRY'S CASTLE ISN'T STOPPED,
THEN EVERYTHING WE'VE BEEN DOING IS A WASTE OF TIME.
AND IF THEY GET TO THE TOOTH FAIRY,
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL ALL HUMAN BELIEF.
UNLESS SUSAN GETS THERE FIRST.
Yes, well, it's coming along well.
Very impressive!
Well done.
I need your help, Mr Ridcully.
I, err... you're...
Yes.
The scythe, the cloak, the white horse, the granddaughter.
I need you to wake him up.
His name's Bilious.
He's the Oh-God of Hangovers.
Something nasty's happening tonight.
I'm hoping he can tell me what it is.
But he's got to be able to think straight first.
And you brought him here?
Why are you doing that?
I mean, I was a bit behind with the teeth, I know— –Is this her door?
–Don't know, there was $13 in pillow money...
–Is this her door?
I admit, but I signed the form GV19 for them...
Will you just shut up and answer the question?
I don't know, I've never been here before.
Then your boss probably doesn't realise how irritating you are.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Or Miss Bottler gets it.
S'that good, I g'it!
Have you got the lid?
THIS IS REALLY, REALLY STUPID.
I think the tradition got started when everyone had them big chimneys, master.
INDEED?
IT'S ONLY A MERCY IT'S UNLIT.
THE BOY WANTS A PAIR OF TROUSERS THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SHARE,
A HUGE MEAT PIE, A SUGAR MOUSE, 'A LOT OF TOYS' AND A PUPPY CALLED SCRUFF.
Ah, sweet.
I shall wipe away a tear, 'cos what he's gettin', see, is this little wooden toy and an apple.
BUT THE LETTER CLEARLY—
I know, it's the socio-economic factors.
The world'd be in a hell of a mess if everyone got what they asked for, eh?
I GAVE THEM WHAT THEY WANTED IN THE STORE.
What good's a god who gives you everything you want?
YOU HAVE ME THERE.
It's the hope that's important.
It's a big part of belief, hope.
Give people jam today and they'll just sit and eat it.
Jam tomorrow, now— that'll keep them going for ever.
AND YOU MEAN THAT BECAUSE OF THIS THE POOR GET POOR THINGS
AND THE RICH GET RICH THINGS?
Oh, yeah.
That's the meaning of Hogswatch, isn't it, master?
BUT I'M THE HOGFATHER!
AT THE MOMENT, I MEAN.
Well, it makes no difference.
I remember when I was a nipper, it was one Hogswatch.
I had my heart set on this huge model horse in this shop.
It was what I always wanted.
Someone was in there buying it.
And you know, just for a second,
I thought it really was going to be for me.
But it wasn't.
I spent hours with my nose pressed up against the window, until someone heard me callin', and unfroze me.
Yes, I would've killed for that horse.
But I still hung up my stocking on Hogswatch Eve.
You know why?
Because I had hope!
And the next morning, our dad's put in my stocking a little wooden horse, that he carved his very own self.
AH, AND THAT WAS WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE EXPENSIVE TOY HORSES IN THE WORLD!
No, 'cause you're a selfish little bugger when you're seven.
Only grown-ups think like that.
THIS IS WRONG.
IT IS...
UNFAIR.
That's life, is it, master, isn't it?
BUT I'M NOT.
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY.
AND OTHER THINGS ENDING IN
-OLLY.
Please, just take her out of vocal range.
Mr Brown!
Your big moment.
Break me up the real Tooth Fairy.
If you're the Lecturer in Recent Runes, can't you do something more magical?
Well, Spold's Unstirring Divisor would do it.
You'd end up with a large beaker filled with all the nastiness.
Not difficult at all, if you don't mind the side effects.
Tell me about the side effects.
The main one is that the rest of him would end up in a somewhat larger beaker.
Alive?
Broadly, yes.
Living tissue, certainly.
And definitely sober.
Why don't we just mix up absolutely everything and see what happens?
It's gonna be worth a try.
Thank you, Modo.
Is this going to take much longer?
We may not have much time.
Oh, you can't be too careful.
What's that?
Wow-Wow Sauce.
The hottest sauce in the Universe.
And it will blow your head clean off.
It's not safe to drink it when the sweat's still condensing on the bottle.
On the other hand, if it's a kill-or-cure remedy then we are, given the possibility that the patient is immortal, probably on to a winner.
It did not go critical yet.
I don't know, I wish you fellows would show some backbone...
Careful, Archchancellor.
What you have there might represent pure sobriety!
I'll try it.
You did say that he was immortal, didn't you?
–You mean... he just appeared?
–Yes.
He has no memory of existing before appearing at the Hogfather's castle.
You mean like this fella?
Don't be ridiculous, gods and gnomes don't just appear for no reason!
Bring me, let's see, twenty pints of lager, some pepper vodka, and a bottle of cofee liquor.
I didn't have you sobered up just so that you can go on a binge.
You don't drink!
–I don't?
Oh.
Yeah.
I need you to help me!
I'm afraid I did it, didn't I?
I said something to young Stibbons about drinking and hangovers.
You mean you created him just like that?
I find that very hard to believe, master.
Good job nobody mentioned the Hair Loss Fairy, then.
I am not losing my hair!
It is just very finely spaced.
Yes, half on your head and half on your hairbrush!
For the last time, I am not...
I wish I knew where that was coming from.
We need a bigger brain for this.
That thinking engine of yours is working, Ponder?
Hex is resting, Archchancellor.
Can you hear me in there⁈
You don't have to shout, Archchancellor.
What is that glingleglingleglingle noise all about?
It says, look on the Dean.
Over the Dean?
Is there a problem?
Are you the Hair Loss Fairy?
Apparently.
What have you been doing with my hair?
Just a minute!
Where exactly were you, before I found you in the snow?
Anywhere where drink was consumed in beastly quantities some time previously, you could say.
So, you were an immanent vital force, eh?
Oh, sounds great!
What is that?
So when we joked about the Hair Loss Fairy it suddenly focused on the Dean's head.
You're calling things into being.
I personally always wondered, if there was an Eater of Socks.
You know how there's always one missing.
To the laundry!
Tell me again, who these people are.
Some of the cleverest men in the world.
And I'm sober, am I?
What is that ridiculous thing on your head?
I dunno, sir!
What?
What is it?
It says here, 'lf found, please return to the Tooth Fairy's castle.'
At least the Tooth Fairy already existed.
Tooth Fairy...
Oh, you see her around a lot these days.
Or them, rather.
It's a sort of franchise operation to collect children's teeth in exchange for money.
And she has a castle?
She sounds great.
Actually, I do remember one thing.
When I appeared at the Hogfather's house, there was this drunken little fellow in a pointy hat.
I thought it was just the drink talking, but he did mention something about...
Permanent end of the patrol-servitude for the little elves!
Of all fantasy personifications.
...including the Tooth Fairy.
Where did you find this?
Is he all right?
I say, what is the geographical location of the Tooth Fairy's castle?
Now I'm feeling all well.
Can I come with you?
This is not a normal situation.
Look, I think I better tell you.
My grandfather is Death.
–Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Death.
You know, Death?
The robes, the scythe, the white horse, bones...
Death.
But at the moment he's acting rather strange.
I just want to make sure I got this clear.
You think your grandfather is Death, and you think he's acting strange.
Look, Death adopted my mother.
He then took on a human apprentice.
They fell in love, and I'm the result.
This is fascinating.
Let's just say I've picked up a few, strange genetic knacks along the way.
Oh, that looks dangerous.
I hope so.
Wait, I could help you!
Would you be any good in a fight?
Yes, I could be sick on people!
I have to sort this out.
Can't have creatures popping into existence just by people talking about them.
Unhygienic.
So what is this implied creation, eh?
"Humans have always ascribed random, seasonal, natural or inexplicable actions to human shaped entities.
Such examples are the Hogfather, the Tooth Fairy and Death."
All right, but I'm damn sure there's never been an Eater of Socks or an Οh-God of Hangovers.
I think it works like this:
What we're getting is personification of forces, just like Hex said.
Like the Hogfather?
When you're a kiddie, it's as good an explanation, as any to where the presents come from.
Why is it happening now?
"Belief's causing new creatures to appear"?
You could put it like that.
"There's a finite quantitiy of belief in the Universe"?
Certainly, people're going to believe only in so many things.
"It follows that if a major focus of belief is removed, there would be spare belief."
What are people not believing in all of a sudden?
"Out of cheese error?
Melon, melon, melon.
Redo from start!"
It's Hogswatch.
I suppose the Hogfather is around, isn't he?
I LIKE THIS JOB.
Oh dear, oh dear.
EXCUSE ME.
YES.
THIS WILL SHOW.
The poor little match girls dying in the snow is all part of the spirit of Hogswatch, master.
You see, people hear about it, and they say:
'we might be as poor as a disabled banana, and only can afford to eat mud and boots, but see how much better off we are than the poor little match girl?
'
It makes them feel happy and grateful for what they've got.
I KNOW WHAT THE SPIRIT OF HOGSWATCH IS, ALBERT.
You're not allowed to do that!
THE HOGFATHER CAN.
THE HOGFATHER GIVES PRESENTS.
THERE IS NO BETTER PRESENT THAN A FUTURE.
That's it.
I had enough with this pixie life.
I'm waiting for the Hogfather.
I'm in the dark, waiting for the Hogfather.
Me.
A believer in natural philosophy.
I can find the square root of 27.4 in my head.
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's not as if I've hung a stocking up.
There'd be some point if...
TAKE HER SOMEWHERE WARM, AND GIVE HER A GOOD DINNER.
AND I MAY WELL BE CHECKING ON LATER.
Looks like we've been chosen to do a bit of charity.
Well, I don't call it very charitable just dumping someone on people, like this.
I dunno.
Some people wouldn't know the real meaning of Hogswatch if it jumps up and caught them in the grope.
No!
This is a child's painting.
Twyla paints like that.
I painted like that.
Grandfather saved some of my draw—
Come on, let's find the house.
What house?
There's always a house.
I was told you're the best locksmith in the city.
Yes, but locks normally don't alter themselves while you're working on them, that's what I'm saying.
Are you the best, or not?
No!
Not the dark!
Banjo!
I'm getting out of here.
There's something wrong with this place.
I've made a big pile!
You want to come with me?
Pretty here.
Mr Sideney.
Would he deliver to apes earlier than to humans?
Interesting point, sir.
Possibly, you are referring to my theory that humans may have descended from apes.
A bold hypothesis, which, if the grants committee could just see their way clear to letting me hire a boat, and sail around... to the islands...
I just thought, he might deliver alphabetically.
LET ME SEE NOW...
Who the hell are you?
I'M THE HOGFATHER, OF COURSE.
ER...
HO, HO, HO.
You look extremely thin in the face.
I'M...
I'M A BIT ILL.
Terminally, I would say.
It's a false beard!
NO, IT'S NOT!
It's got hooks for the ears!
That must have given you a spot of trouble.
A pillow!
I thought there were seven locks.
Yes, but they're half magic and half real and half not there.
There's parts of them that don't exist all the time!
I thought you could open any lock anyone ever made.
Made by humans, And most dwarfs.
I dunno what made these.
You never said anything about magic.
That's a shame.
Then really I have no more need of your services.
You may as well go back home.
What about my money?
Of course, you should get what you deserve.
You must think I was born yesterday, Mr Teacup.
I'm leaving, right?
With what's coming to me.
And you ain't stopping me.
Banjo certainly ain't.
I knew his old Ma in the good old days.
You think you're nasty?
You think you're mean?
Ma Lilywhite'd tear your ears off and spit 'em in your eye, you cocky little devil.
I remember you when you was little, Banjo.
I used to sit you on my knees!
Banjo!
There you are.
Where do all those shadows coming from?
It's giving me the creeps!
And it's all your fault!
Oh, yeah?
So it wasn't you who said, wow, ten thousand dollars, count me in?
Yeah, but I didn't know there was going to be all this creepy stuff!
I want to go home!
You're acting like a child!
Poor guy must've slipped.
Yeah.
He slipped.
That's the Tooth Fairy's castle?
It's teeth.
And I should be scared?
There's nothing that scary about teeth.
Did I say I was scared?
I must just be hung over, again.
–Oh, no.
–They're only teeth?
Surely, noone would try to...
What is that?
It's such old magic, it isn't even magic anymore.
If you've got a piece of someone's hair, nail clipping or tooth, you can control them.
Don't tell me someone is... –What's that shadow?
–This place is alive.
And it's protecting itself.
Now, what happened to the other fellow?
WELL, THE HOGFATHER HAS ENEMIES.
What'd he do?
Miss a chimney?
There's people down there, Mr Teatime!
Well, just do away with them.
One of them is a girl.
Then do away with them... politely.
Keep going.
Quicker.
Aaah!
It's after me!
Let me out!
What was that?
It's finding their nightmares.
Let me out!
It's after me!
Pull yourself together.
There's nothing chasing you.
I thought it was the... wardrobe.
What wardrobe?
When I was a kid, we had this big... wardrobe.
And it had this... on the door...
it had this face!
And at night it...
whispered things.
Who's that moving up there?
I think they saw us.
If they are tooth fairies, there has been a really stupid equal opportunity policy.
Right.
You go that way, I this way.
–Why don't we stay together?
–What's got into you?
This is a children's place.
The rules are what children believe.
Well, that's a relief.
You think so?
It's impossible to die here.
My grandfather doesn't figure in a child world.
That man who fell down the stairs looked pretty dead to me.
Oh, you die.
But not here.
You...
let's see... yes.
You go somewhere else.
Away.
–Aren't you Sus—?
–Yes.
When you came for Twyla's last tooth, you were so shocked I could see you.
Look, we may not have a lot of time.
Is this the Tooth Fairy?
A tooth fairy.
Do you drink at all?
No, I don't.
Not touch alcohol, at all?
Never.
My dad's very strict about that sort of thing.
Nice castle!
Can we get on?
Good.
Who brought you here, Violet?
I don't know.
Oh, but he's dressed like an assassin!
OK.
You two stay here, I'll go find him.
And I'll look after Violet.
That's the fourth lock, open.
I commend your expertise.
And the others?
Do you know exactly what's in here, Mr Teatime?
Logically, she's the guardian of children's beliefs.
And this is her castle.
And I come across a securely locked door as this, and not to thoroughly investigate would... lack elegance.
What's that sound?
What sound?
That sound!
Like old...
scissors, grating.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE AUDITORS?
I suppose the Bursar might have done.
NOT AUDITORS OF MONEY.
AUDITORS OF REALITY.
THEY'RE THE CIVIL SERVICE OF EVERYTHING.
And they want to get rid of us.
THEY WANT HUMANS TO BE LESS CREATIVE.
THE HOGFATHER IS A SYMBOL OF THIS.
STRANGE THINKING.
THEY HATE THE WAY HUMANS MAKE UP STORIES ABOUT THE UNIVERSE.
I can't think why.
Anyway, why are you doing this job?
SOMEONE MUST.
IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT.
BEFORE DAWN, THERE MUST BE ENOUGH BELIEF IN THE HOGFATHER.
Why?
SO THAT THE SUN WILL COME UP.
I SELDOM JOKE.
What sort of goding do you do?
Well, I'm the Oh God of Hangovers.
A God of Hangovers?
How awful.
You're more cut out to be one of those improtant gods.
What's this?
Lovers' Lane?
You leave him alone, you!
He's a god!
Dear me, out of thunderbolts, are we?
Well, y'know, I've never killed a...
What's the matter?
It's just a wardrobe, yes.
I don't want to see!
I don't want to see!
Hex was right, Archchancellor.
HEX?
WHO IS HEX?
He's the biggest thinker in the world.
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THIS MR HEX.
Quite a large thaumic reading, gentlemen.
I think he got here by magic.
THEY SAY YOU ARE THE BIGGEST THINKER IN THE WORLD.
BUT DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE?
+++ Yes +++
EXTEND LOGICALLY THE RESULT OF THE HUMAN RACE CEASING TO BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER.
WILL THE SUN COME UP?
ANSWER.
+++The Sun Will Not Come Up+++
CORRECT.
HOW MAY THIS BE PREVENTED?
ANSWER.
+++Regular and Consistent Belief+++
GOOD.
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU, THINKING ENGINE.
BELIEVE IN THE HOGFATHER.
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER.
DO YOU BELIEVE?
ANSWER!
+++YES+++
GOOD.
...OH, NO... +++Dear Hogfather, for Hogswatch I want...
LET ME SEE.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
AND HAVE YOU BEEN NAUGHTY, OR NICE?
Hello.
Well, well, well.
What have we here?
Bone handle, rather tasteless skull and bone decoration...
Death himself's second favourite weapon.
Am I right?
Oh, my.
It must be Hogswatch.
This must mean that you are Susan.
The famous granddaughter.
Nobility.
I'd bow, but I'm afraid you would do something... dreadful.
Yes!
Yes!
Left-handed using a wooden pick!
It's simple.
Ah, Mr Teatime!
I've managed to open the fifth lock.
No problem!
It's just based on Woddeley's Occult Sequence.
How do you know who I am?
Easy.
Twurp's Peerage.
Family motto: 'Non temetis messor'.
Your father was well known.
Went a long way very fast.
As for your grandfather... honestly, that motto. 'Fear Not The Reaper'.
Is that good taste?
Of course, you don't need to fear him, do you?
Or do you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who are you, anyway?
I beg your pardon.
My name is Teatime, Jonathan Teatime.
At your service.
You mean...
like around four o'clock in the afternoon?
No.
I did say Teh-ah-tim-eh.
Please don't try to break my concentration by annoying me.
How are you getting on, Mr Sideney?
If it's just according to Woddeley's sequence, number six should be copper and blue-green light.
Do you think your grandfather will try to rescue you?
But now I have his sword, you see.
I wonder...
All fingers and thumbs, Mr Sideney?
I've managed to open the sixth lock, Mr Teatime.
Really?
But it may not be all important now.
Thank you, anyway.
You've been most helpful.
Yes, you may go.
Is that all you're here for?
A robbery?
Like a petty thief.
A thief?
Me?
I'm not a thief, madam.
No, these gentlemen are thieves.
That's Medium Dave and exhibit B is Banjo.
He can talk!
–Who are you?
–I'm incognito!
Look like a wizard to me.
Did you suck your thumb when you were litle?
No!
That's the Scissor Man!
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!
Kids believe all kinds of crap!
But I'm a grown up now, right.
No more Hogfather.
And that's only the start.
I'll be able to make people believe anything I want.
What's this?
You said no more Hogfather?
He does know what we've been doing here, doesn't he?
You did tell him?
There's gotta be a Hogfather.
There's always a Hogfather.
She did it!
She killed him!
No, I didn't!
–Did!
–Didn't!
–Did!
–Didn't!
–Did!
What's this about the Hogfather?
I don't think he's dead, but Teatime has made him very ill.
Who cares?
When this is over, Banjo, you'll have as many presents as you want.
Trust me.
There has to be a Hogfather, or there's no Hogswatch!
It's just another solar festival!
Banjo and me are going.
Bajo!
You're coming with me, right now.
Grab her, Banjo.
It's all her fault.
Our Mom said, no hitting girls!
No touching 'em, or pulling' their hair!
She's not a girl.
She's a freak!
I think I know you, Teatime.
You're the mad kid they're all scared of, right?
Banjo!
I said, grab her.
Our Mom said—
The kid who didn't know the difference between chucking a stone at a cat, and setting it on fire.
Shut up!
Get her, Banjo!
The kind of little boy, who looks up dolls' dresses.
I didn't.
–Our Mom said— –Oh, to blazes with your mam!
What'd you say about our mam?
I bet no one wanted to played with you, not the kid with no friends.
Banjo!
You do as I tell you.
Our... our mam... our mam said...
Have you been a bad boy, Banjo⁈
You've been letting him get into trouble again, eh, Davey?
You have, ain't you!
?
No, Mom!
No, Mom!
You need a good hiding, Banjo?
Sorry, sorry, Mom!
You been playing with girls again⁈
Sorry, sorry, Mom!
No Mum no Mum no Mum nooooh Mum!
Oh, no!
I don't think so!
This place gets into your head, doesn't it?
It finds out how to deal with you.
But I'm in touch with my inner child.
It's so much fun.
No pulling' girls hair!
That's bad!
I'm going to have such fun with this!
It's so light.
You wouldn't dare use it.
My grandfather will come after you!
He comes after everyone.
He's very single-minded.
I'll be ready for him.
It doesn't work here.
There's no death here.
Hi, inner child!
I'm the inner baby sitter!
Happy Hogswatch!
Is he dead?
He's not breathing.
Breathing spell... breathing spell!
Spolt's Forthright Respirator, perhaps.
I think I've got it written down somewhere...
Come on, chaps!
Give me some space.
Excuse me, excuse me!
This is vitally important for the advancement of natural philosophy.
Did you see any bright lights?
Was there a shining tunnel?
Did any deceased—
What's all this, Mr Stibbons?
Put the damn quill away!
This must be the Unseen University.
And you're all wizards.
There was a sword!
Oh, yes.
It's fallen on the floor.
Did I do that?
I really must be off.
He won't get far.
The main doors are locked in accordance with Archchancellor Spode's Rules.
Won't get far... while holding a sword that appears to be able to cut through anything.
You can get into trouble, hitting girls.
No playin' with girls.
What am I gonna do now?
Hello, my dear.
No.
Sorry, dear?
You're not the Tooth Fairy.
Oh, I am, dear.
Grandma, what big teeth you have.
You've even got a shawl.
Oh, dear.
I don't understand, lovely.
You forgot the rocking chair.
I always thought there'd be a rocking chair.
I don't think you're real.
It's not a little, old woman in a shawl, running this place.
You're out of my head.
That's how you defend yourself.
You poke around in people's head, and find the things that—
No.
It's horrible, but it does not frighten me.
I like spiders.
Dogs, no.
I like rats, rats are fine.
Sorry, is anyone frightened of that?
Help!
I...
I...
You're a bogeyman, aren't you?
Not 'a'.
The!
The first Bogeyman!
You look terrible.
Thank you very much.
I mean ill.
I used to jump out on them, and say:
Boo!
But then, I got to like them.
Only children were frigthened of me.
I mean, what's to be scared of?
Bones, phoney arms...
But then, I discovered that there are much worse things than me.
And I wanted to protect the children.
Get them safe from all the really bad things.
So, I built all this, to be a safe place.
And the teeth?
If you leave all those teeth around, anything could happen!
Anything nearly did.
So, you are the Tooth Fairy, then.
Yes.
I... and then they came... stealing.
I'm too weak to look after them any more.
You don't die here.
Just get old.
Listening to the laughter...
Don't worry about the teeth.
I'll make them safe again.
I think it would be a good idea, if you did the Tooth Fairy's job, Banjo.
D'ya think that be all right?
Won't the Tooth Fairy mind?
You... do it until she comes back.
Who's gonna tell me what to do?
Noone's ever going to tell you what to do again, Banjo.
Thanks, Miss.
I'll keep the teeth safe.
Ah, Miss?
–Yes, Banjo?
Can I have a puppy?
I had a kitten, but our Mom drowned it 'cause it was dirty.
I think it will turn up quite soon, Banjo.
Thanks, Miss.
With Violet we talked about it and we thought we ought to come back and help.
It's okay.
They're all gone.
And Banjo needed a new job.
That's funny.
So does Bili!
Why don't you two make yourselves useful, and help Banjo clear up this mess.
He's pretty much running the place now.
–But he's a— –He's in charge.
We'd love to help Banjo.
Together.
Good.
Have fun.
Now I'm going home.
This is a hell of a way to spend Hogswatch.
Grandfather, what're you doing here?
IT IS NOT OVER.
YOU MUST BRING THE HOGFATHER HOME.
These look like the mountains where the Castle of Bones was.
THEY ARE.
–It's a pig!
–A BOAR.
This boar is the...
YES.
THE HOGFATHER, AS HE BEGAN.
And the dogs...
THESE ARE NOT REAL DOGS.
IF THEY CATCH HIM, HE WON'T JUST DIE.
HE WILL NEVER BE.
Well, stop them!
THIS IS A HUMAN THING.
THE AUDITORS ARE DESPERATE NOW.
THEY ARE DETERMINED TO DESTROY THE HOGFATHER,
AT WHATEVER COST.
YOU MUST SAVE HIM.
Come on, jump!
Just you try it!
Yes!
Who wants some?
Anyone else?
HO, HO, HO.
YOU COULDN'T RESIST IT IN THE END.
A MISTAKE, I FANCY.
IT GETS UNDER YOUR SKIN, LIFE.
SPEAKING METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE.
AND, YOU SEE, THE MORE YOU STRUGGLE FOR EVERY MOMENT,
THE MORE ALIVE YOU STAY.
WHICH IS WHERE I COME IN, AS A MATTER OF FACT.
You can't do this!
There are rules!
YES.
THERE ARE RULES.
BUT YOU BROKE THEM!
HOW DARE YOU?
HOW DARE YOU!
?
AND NOW, THERE REMAINS ONLY ONE FINAL QUESTION...
HAVE YOU BEEN NAUGHTY, OR NICE?
HO.
HO.
HO.
We saved you.
Dying isn't how it's supposed to go.
OH.
SORRY.
Well.
That about wraps it up for this dress.
I'd just like to ask, purely out of academic interest, you were sure I was going to survive, were you?
I WAS QUITE CONFIDENT.
Good.
Now, tell me...
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU HADN'T SAVED HIM?
Yes.
THE SUN WOULD NOT HAVE RISEN.
Then what would have happened?
A MERE BALL OF FLAMING GAS WOULD HAVE ILLUMINATED THE WORLD.
All right, I'm not stupid.
You're saying that humans need fantasies to make life bearable.
NO.
HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN.
TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.
With Tooth Fairies?
Hogfathers?
YES.
THAT'S PRACTICE.
YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE LITTLE LIES.
So we can believe the big ones?
YES.
JUSTICE, MERCY, DUTY, THAT SORT OF THING.
They're not the same at all.
YOU THINK SO?
THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER,
AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE,
AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE,
ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY.
AND YET...
YOU TRY TO ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD.
AS IF THERE IS SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE,
BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.
But people have got to believe that.
What's the point?
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE.
HOW ELSE CAN THEY BECOME?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VISIT FOR HOGSWATCH DINNER?
ALBERT IS FRYING A PUDDING.
I... er... they're really expecting me here.
Would you like a drink before you go?
A CUP OF COCOA WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
Right.
There are biscuits in the tin on the mantlepiece.
Susan's got a poker, you know.
MY GOODNESS ME.
I thought all of you knew that by now.
INDEED.
Last week she picked a bogey up by its nose.
I'll give Gawain his stocking and then I'll come and watch.
SUSAN?
Well, well, now this is unexpected.
A family affair?
I wonder, is it possible to kill Death?
This must be a very special sword.
And it certainly works here.
And of course, it might well not be regarded as murder.
Possibly it is a civic act.
It would be, as they say...
the Big One.
You may have some personal knowledge about your vulnerability, but I'm pretty certain that Susan here would quite definitely die.
So I'd rather you didn't try any last-minute stuff.
I AM LAST MINUTE STUFF.
I don't remember them asking for anything that made a noise.
OH, THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE STOCKING THAT MAKES A NOISE.
OTHERWISE WHAT IS 4.30 A.M FOR?
There are children?
Oh yes, of course.
Call them!
Certainly not.
It will be instructive.
Educational.
And when your adversary is Death, you cannot help but be the good guy.
Call them.
Gawain, Twyla!
Come in, come in, curly-haired tots!
I've caught this bogeyman.
What shall we do with him, eh?
It's only a skeleton.
Yes, a nasty, creepy, horrible skeleton.
Scary, ah?
He's eating a biscuit.
A creepy bony man in a black robe.
You're fidgeting with that kettle.
So I expect you're thinking of doing something creative.
Put it down, please.
Slowly.
Huh, that's not very creepy, it's just bones.
It's just standing there.
It's not even making woo-woo noises.
And anyway you're creepy.
Your eye's weird.
Really?
Then let's see how creepy I can be.
Oh, no.
It could not have gone through you.
So many ribs, and things...
It only kills monsters.
Stop time, now!
You winked at me.
I thought you had a plan!
INDEED, OH YES.
I PLANNED TO SEE WHAT YOU'D DO.
What?
I DID ADD THE SPARKLY STARS AND THE NOISE, THOUGH.
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.
And if I hadn't done anything?
I DARESAY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.
AT THE LAST MINUTE.
That was the last minute.
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME FOR ANOTHER LAST MINUTE.
STOP PLAYING DEAD, MISTER TEH-AH-TIM-EH.
You got it right!
OF COURSE.
I'LL TAKE THE BODY.
THAT WILL PREVENT INCONVENIENT QUESTIONS.
YOU DID KNOW THE POKER WOULD GO THROUGH ME?
I was quite confident.
I'VE MADE THIS FOR YOU.
Thank you.
Er... what is it?
ALBERT SAID THERE OUGHT TO BE SNOW ON IT,
BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE MELTED.
IT IS, OF COURSE, A HOGSWATCH CARD.
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A ROBIN ON IT AS WELL,
BUT I HAD CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING IT TO STAY ON.
IT WAS NOT AT ALL CO-OPERATIVE.
Really?
IT DID NOT SEEM TO GET INTO THE HOGSWATCH SPIRIT AT ALL.
Thank you.
Granddad?
YES?
Why?
I mean, why did you do all this?
HUMAN BEINGS MAKE LIFE SO INTERESTING.
DO YOU KNOW THAT IN A UNIVERSE SO FULL OF WONDERS,
THEY'VE MANAGED TO INVENT BOREDOM?
QUITE ASTONISHING.
WELL, THEN...
HAPPY HOGSWATCH!
Yes.
Granddad!
Happy Hogswatch.
HAPPY HOGSWATCH, AND GOOD NIGHT, CHILDREN EVERYWHERE!
Hello, hello!
...
YOU HAVE A BIG, WOODEN ROCKING HORSE IN THE WINDOW.
Yes, yes.
That's a special order for Lord Lotten...
HOW MUCH WOULD HIS LORDSHIP HAVE PAID YOU?
Twelve dollars.
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTY.
Would you like me to wrap it up for you, sir?
NO.
I'LL TAKE IT AS IT IS, THANK YOU.
INCIDENTALLY, THERE'S A SMALL BOY OUT THERE,
WITH HIS NOSE FROZEN TO THE WINDOW.
SOME WARM WATER SHOULD DO THE TRICK.
Happy Hogswatch, sir!
The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.
June 6, 1980
- Are we going to that party tonight?
- Yeah.
Man, forget about that party, just keep driving right out of Philly.
What's wrong with Philly?
May's got her big plans.
Singing, huh?
She's gonna cut some place of her own in New York City.
Why do you wanna go to New York?
You don't know anyone there.
I know everyone here.
I bet she makes it.
We won't hear from her ever again except for on the radio.
My Daddy says if you plan big you'll just disappoint yourself.
- Yeah, well I got plans that involve you.
- You do?
Oh, crap, get a room.
8 Years Later
So this chick went AWAL after a highway shooting in '88?
Yeah, the guy she was with was killed.
She got winged, skipped out of the hospital before the cops could interview her.
Now someone dropped a dime?
Old classmate saw her on the boardwalk last week.
Man, what is that?
- Rice cake.
- All right.
- May Pierson.
- Yeah.
Philadelphia Homicide.
I don't have anything to do with anything.
That's a pretty broad claim.
I've been up all night, I can't be doing this.
Doing what, May?
You don't even know what it's about.
- Or do you?
- Clem Garris.
Shot on the expressway in '88, you were there.
'Till you fled.
No.
That was another girl.
So you're not May Pierson?
That works at this fine establishment and drives this vehicle?
I'm sayin' that was a lifetime ago.
Yeah, we gotta talk about it.
- Forget it, I'm goin' home.
- This ain't a debate, May, we got a warrant.
We do this here or do it in Philly.
You can't take me there, on what basis?
Obstructing a police investigation '88, New York bench warrant '94.
And irritating two homicide guys, 2006.
Get in the car.
Philadelphia Police Department Central Division
Were you in court this morning?
Cat emergency,
Olivia got chomped by a neighbor dog.
He gets the other eye?
That's not funny.
Rita.
Hi, John.
I almost came by, I didn't wanna bother you.
Lilly Rush, Rita Hart.
Formerly Stillman.
Oh, hi.
Um I'll see you later, boss.
So, what brings you here?
- House got robbed last night.
- No kiddin'?
Yeah, I just reported it.
Was Joel with you?
Joel moved out.
Few months ago.
- The drinking?
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
- It's better.
I'll talk to major crimes, have them fast track it. / OK.
- Give you a call.
- Thanks.
Clem Garris shot and killed January '88, found on the shoulder of I-76.
But not alone.
No, that's the scandelous part, he was found with a woman not his wife.
May Pierson.
Was shot in the arm, slipped out of the ER before the cops could get a play by play.
But Vera and Valens picked her up this morning.
Got her upstairs.
Leaves the scene and doesn't turn up for 18 years?
- That's a person of interest.
- At least.
Clem told his wife Sally, he'd be at a local bar that night with the guys.
So why is he out on the highway with this gal?
Rough way to find out what your husband's up to.
Unless Sally already knew.
Decided she'd had enough.
Making her a person of interest number two.
Between New York and Jersey, there's a lot of ink on you May.
That's from way back.
A DUI, arrest for loitering, solicitation?
I know what I did.
Now you know why I ditched the cops that night.
You didn't wanna get jammed up.
Never mind helping find who killed your boyfriend Clem.
He wasn't my boyfriend.
Sayin' you weren't screwing' around?
I hadn't seen him in years.
Well then how the heck do you end up on that highway with him, May?
I ran into Clem at Atlantic City that night.
Told his wife he was at a Philly bar.
I can't account for that.
So, you run into him.
We're talking about old times, we're both heading' back to Philly, he offers me a ride.
- And?
- And we're almost there.
Get bumped from behind.
He pulls over.
Gets out.
Gets shot.
Just like that.
Clem talk about bein' in trouble?
Anything like that?
I don't know what his life was like.
We'd said our goodbyes years earlier when we were just kids.
May Pierson shows up.
What's one last shift.
You're really goin', huh?
Leavin' for New York, 8 am.
Not gonna wait for Petie to come get you?
Petie's a big college football star.
He's never comin' back.
You gonna marry Sally?
That's the plan.
What if you came with me instead?
Come with you?
Remember that day we drove around playing 'Born To Run' until the tape broke?
Yeah, we ran out of gas.
We could spend every day like that.
I'm not like you, May.
I'm not a big dream kind of person.
But you are.
I gotta stay.
Well.
She sure is pretty.
Bye, Mayflower.
Just Married
That's how I like to remember Clem.
'Cause when I saw him that night at Atlantic City, he'd turned into just another disappointed working guy.
It happens.
That's what I know.
Now can I get back to Jersey?
- So May Pierson gave us new details about your husband's murder.
Like?
/ He was in Atlantic City that night.
Not in Philly, like he told you.
Look, I know everyone thought
Clem must have been seein' her behind my back, but he wasn't.
How do you know?
Clem wasn't perfect, but he was more good than bad.
And when he was in something, he was in.
When I was 19,
I took off with a guy 2 weeks into knowing' him.
The heart wants what it wants.
Yeah.
He was a biker, drinker.
But I thought this is it.
Roll out the carpet, we're goin' down the aisle.
You didn't go through with it?
We came close.
We were road trippin'.
Went to a courthouse in Knoxville and we just sat out there on his bike.
Neither one of us could get off.
Well Clem and I never had any doubts. / No?
Getting married was the happiest day of our lives.
Anyone unhappy that day?
One person.
- Are you sorry?
- No, come on.
I didn't want it to be this way.
We were gonna have babies anyway.
We're doin' the right thing, Sal.
I'm gonna make you happy every day.
What a frickin' joke.
Petie, we didn't think you were coming.
You two aren't foolin' anyone.
Are you drinkin' this early?
You're just marrying here because she's knocked up OK, and everyone knows it.
- Keep it down.
- Pete you're acting really embarassing...
Whoa, I'm embarassing?
I know who you really wanna be with.
It's my girl.
May.
What the hell happened to you?
What would happen?
I got my ass kicked out and I'm washed up and my girl's gone so you get everything and I get nothing.
Hey start up my car.
Me and my bride are pullin' outta here.
Just Married
Petie had some kind of wall?
Somethin' went real wrong at Penn State.
He dropped out, came home damaged good.
Brought some strong feelings home.
If it's true, that Clem was in Atlantic City that night?
/ Yeah?
Petie spent a lot of time there.
So he could've run into Clem and May, and reacted badly?
I can't put it past him.
He's in jail now.
I hear you made a spectacle of yourself at that wedding, Petie.
Yeah, what a jerk.
Pretty bitter about things going so good for Clem?
I was in a real bad way then.
I just lost my free ride to Penn State.
- I played ball, too.
- Yeah?
What went wrong?
First game, I choked.
Froze up on the field, did it all year.
Got cut.
Couldn't've been easy comin' home after that. / It wasn't.
- People look at you like you're crap.
- Including Clem?
No.
He was cool.
I apologized for the wedding thing.
We moved on.
Started hangin' out again.
Were you surprised to hear that he was with May the night he died?
/ Yeah.
- Everyone was.
- Bother you at all?
- How do you mean?
- She was your girl, right?
I went with her in high school.
So maybe you wanted to get back to that time.
When you were a football star, and had your girl May.
Not denying those were better times but 8 years later I wasn't thinkin' about May.
- No?
- I was thinkin' about someone else.
¢Ü Glory Days by Bruce Springsteen ¢Ü
9 seconds left and crazy Rick tosses me that screen pass.
Yeah, I remember, me and Sal were on the field gettin' ready to do the homecoming thing.
Caught that baby, turned on the jets.
- That was something.
- Crazy times, crazy times.
Never been a prettier homecoming queen, Sal.
You in that white dress.
You remember that, huh?
Are you kidding me?
Everybody noticed.
Someone got the best catch in school.
I sure did.
Who's that?
A guy I do favors for, make some cash.
- I'd better get back to the baby.
- I'll be home soon.
Why is she so down?
Things have been kind of yippy at home.
You know truthfully, man,
I don't know if me and Sal were ready for all this.
So young.
- It's probably just tough times, right?
- Yeah.
No, man.
- It's more than that.
- You think she's sorry?
I think she wishes she didn't cry every night.
So Clem and Sally were on the outs.
Win or lose.
I'll lay it out for you.
Things between me and Sally kind of grew.
So Sally and Petie started up.
?
Clem their marriage was so great.
That gives her motive if she wanted out for good.
What about these favors that Petie was doing for money?
Breakin' legs, stealing cars.
Thug stuff.
Clem ever get in on it?
Petie says he offered but Clem wouldn't go for it.
The guy walked the line.
Uh, anyway guys, good night.
What's he nervous about?
Her.
So they found who did the robberies?
Bobby Greene.
Lived up the street.
He used to throw mudballs at our windows.
- That little kid?
- He's grown up.
- Criminal now.
- Oh, God.
He hit two other houses on the block but he got picked up this morning.
That's sad.
So, why didn't you come to me about this in the first place?
I knew you'd be busy.
A long time to be less busy.
You are who you are.
I would like to think I've learned some things.
- Anyway I...
- Would you.... you wanna have dinner?
- Go to Irena's?
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'm free Friday.
- Me, too.
- 7?
- OK.
OK.
- All right, I'll see you.
- OK.
- 7.
- Yeah.
Clem made you happy every day.
- Right Sally?
- Right.
- Don't wanna revise that statement?
- Why would I?
How about because you were bangin' Petie.
- That was wrong.
- But it happened.
And you not tellin' that, get's the wheels turnin'.
Maybe you felt trapped.
Things between you and Clem died out but he wouldn't give up.
'Cause when he was in somethin' he was in. / Look.
I never had that kind of love again.
So maybe I wanna remember things a certain way.
But we don't live in that land, Sal.
We got a real life murder to solve.
That's true.
Things faded.
And?
/ And it's true Clem wasn't one to give up.
But he did.
Finally.
- Oh, man it's...
- Valentine's Day.
Baby, I'm sorry.
- I was gonna get flowers and candy.
- It doesn't matter.
Let's go to bed, huh?
No.
We ain't makin' it, are we Sal?
- Why can't we fix it?
- I don't know.
It's just gone.
But it was right.
It was fun and easy and right.
Yeah, it was.
I don't wanna be a divorced person.
Yeah, but do you wanna be this married person?
That's when Petie came into the picture?
It wasn't love.
But he wanted to be with me.
And Clem wanted to be somewhere else.
By the time May came back to town, he knew he could go see her.
May came back?
When her mother died.
Clem went to the funeral.
I told you I hadn't seen Clem since high school.
Oh, I know what you told me.
His wife said he was at the funeral.
Look, I didn't kill him.
Then why lie to my face?
What are you hiding?
Me and Clem did a stupid desperate thing.
Tried to get back something we'd never have again.
I need to hear about that.
I saw him at the funeral.
And?
Everything rushed back.
Clem Garris shows up.
Hey, Mayflower.
I should get to the reception.
Let me drive you.
How'd New York go?
Not too good.
How is that possible?
You're the best singer I've ever heard.
Turns out a lot of people can sing.
You going to that reception?
No.
Just keep drivin'.
You got a guy there?
New York?
No.
Mostly just got debts.
How you been gettin' by?
I don't wanna talk about it.
OK.
I just haven't been livin' right.
What if we started over?
You and me.
How?
/ Get out of here.
Just drive away.
Like we should've done years ago.
I loved you so much.
Maybe it's still in you someplace.
I know it's in me.
I owe this guy.
There's a job I can do.
In Atlantic City, get you money.
- And then clear out of here?
- Yeah, you and me.
Finally.
We thought we could pick up where we left things all those years ago.
But you can't go back.
Learned that the hard way.
So then you met in Atlantic City.
He did this job and we went.
Then the shooting happened.
- What kind of job?
- Just said it was a favor for a guy.
Looked into the dude Petie was doing favors for, he's a lowlife named Henry Mack.
Probably who Clem got mixed up with.
What's this Mack's line of work?
Had a ring of guys stealing cars, at airports, casinos, bringin' then back to his chop shop in Philly.
So maybe Clem's doin' some runs for him that night.
Maybe Petie knows more about that night than he's lettin' on.
- You find this Mack?
- 6 feet under in Trenton.
- Tough interview.
- But there's a story to that.
Guy was murdered, shot on a casino parking' lot.
That connected to Clem somehow?
I'm guessin' because Mack was killed the very same night Clem was.
I know Clem usually walked the line.
Didn't get mixed up in the kind of favors you did.
He kept his nose clean.
Is that maybe just one time when he really needed the money?
- For May?
- Maybe.
But that one time you two worked for Mack.
Clem gets shot.
So does Mack. / Uh-huh.
It's kind of hard to miss what those murders have in common.
- You.
- I was a theif not a killer.
You and Clem were stealing' those cars, maybe get ambitious?
- Decide to double cross Mack?
- No.
But Clem was desperate.
Maybe having' a runnin' buddy made you bold and Henry Mack
- probably deserved the pop in the head.
- I don't know how Mack died.
And after you two waste him, you panic.
Word Clem's gonna fold 'cause he don't got a criminal nature, he walks the line.
Clem was the one guy who was nice to me when I came home a mess!
Everyone else kept away.
He stayed my friend.
So be a friend to him, Petie.
Say what happened that night.
He didn't wanna be dirty.
But it was his only ticket out.
¢Ü Stolen Car by Bruce Springsteen ¢Ü
¢Ü I found me a little girl and I settled down ¢Ü
¢Ü in a pretty little house in a pretty little town ¢Ü
¢Ü We got married, and promised never to part ¢Ü
¢Ü then little by little we drifted from each other's heart ¢Ü
¢Ü Now I'm driving a stolen car ¢Ü
¢Ü down on a pitch black night ¢Ü
¢Ü And I'm doing my best to make it through ¢Ü
¢Ü Well I'm just sittin' down here at a Stanton light ¢Ü
¢Ü I wanna get caught but I never do ¢Ü
¢Ü At first I thought it was just restlessness ¢Ü
¢Ü that would fade as time went by ¢Ü
¢Ü and our love grew deep ¢Ü
¢Ü But in the end it was something more I guess ¢Ü
¢Ü that tore us apart and made us weep ¢Ü
¢Ü And I'm driving a stolen car ¢Ü
¢Ü waitin' on that little red light ¢Ü
¢Ü I keep tellin' myself everything's gonna be alright ¢Ü
¢Ü But I ride by night and I travel in fear ¢Ü
¢Ü That in this darkness I might just disappear ¢Ü
¢Ü She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote ¢Ü
¢Ü When our love was young and we were bold ¢Ü
¢Ü She said last night she read those letters ¢Ü
¢Ü And they made her feel one hundred years old ¢Ü
¢Ü As the river runs by the little town ¢Ü
¢Ü down into the sea ¢Ü
¢Ü it was there in the shade I let my body down...¢Ü
I'm out, Petie.
No if you wanna get paid, we gotta go to Philly.
I'm takin' the car.
- What?
- Forget the money.
No, it's no good, Clem.
Mack won't go fot that.
Mack's not gonna find me.
Be good to her.
He went off to get May.
That's it.
The '69 Chevy, huh?
It was a beauty.
Yeah.
I've seen it.
You're still driving the same car you and Clem took out of Atlantic City.
And the only person who knew where Clem was going that night?
- Petie.
- It wasn't Petie.
- Who then?
- A guy.
Clem called him Mack.
There had to be two people, May.
Someone drove that second car away.
And somehow the Chevy ended up back with you.
You would'nt've given us Mack right off.
Unless it was someone you wanted to protect.
Maybe you and Petie need to talk.
Hey, Mayflower!
Hi, Petie boy.
May IDed Henry Mack from a photo spread as the shooter.
So we know he was one of our guys at the scene.
But we still got the matter of who was with him.
And who killed him later that night.
You ever make it with singing'?
I'm just a cocktail waitress.
So May says you two made a promise.
Back when Clem died.
Yeah.
I'll keep it Petie.
I'm not scared.
It's over for me.
But you can still have a good life.
What happens?
After Clem takes off in that Chevy?
He finds trouble.
All because of me.
We both had our part in it.
- You think you can steal from me?
- Mack.
Take their car.
Meet me back there.
You gave him up?
He was gonna kill me.
- Get in the car and drive!
- OK, OK.
The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event
- Are we going to that party tonight?
- Yeah
Man, forget about that party, just keep driving right out of Philly
What's wrong with Philly?
May's got her big plans
Singing, huh?
She's gonna cut some place of her own in New York City
Why do you wanna go to New York?
You don't know anyone there
I know everyone here
I bet she makes it
We won't hear from her ever again except for on the radio
My Daddy says if you plan big you'll just disappoint yourself
- Yeah, well I got plans that involve you
- You do?
Oh, crap, get a room
8 Years Later
So this chick went AWAL after a highway shooting in '88?
Yeah, the guy she was with was killed
She got winged, skipped out of the hospital before the cops could interview her
Now someone dropped a dime?
Old classmate saw her on the boardwalk last week
Man, what is that?
- Rice cake
- All right
- May Pierson
- Yeah
Philadelphia Homicide
I don't have anything to do with anything
That's a pretty broad claim
I've been up all night, I can't be doing this
Doing what, May?
You don't even know what it's about
- Or do you?
- Clem Garris
Shot on the expressway in '88, you were there
'Till you fled
No That was another girl
So you're not May Pierson?
That works at this fine establishment and drives this vehicle?
I'm sayin' that was a lifetime ago
Yeah, we gotta talk about it
- Forget it, I'm goin' home
- This ain't a debate, May, we got a warrant We do this here or do it in Philly
You can't take me there, on what basis?
Obstructing a police investigation '88, New York bench warrant '94
And irritating two homicide guys, 2006 Get in the car
Philadelphia Police Department Central Division
Were you in court this morning?
Cat emergency,

Rita
Hi, John
I almost came by, I didn't wanna bother you
Lilly Rush, Rita Hart
Formerly Stillman
Oh, hi Um I'll see you later, boss
So, what brings you here?
- House got robbed last night
- No kiddin'?
Yeah, I just reported it
Was Joel with you?
Joel moved out
Few months ago

- It's better
I'll talk to major crimes, have them fast track it / OK

Clem Garris shot and killed January '88, found on the shoulder of I-76
But not alone
No, that's the scandelous part, he was found with a woman not his wife
May Pierson Was shot in the arm, slipped out of the ER before the cops could get a play by play
But Vera and Valens picked her up this morning
Got her upstairs
Leaves the scene and doesn't turn up for 18 years?
- That's a person of interest
- At least
Clem told his wife Sally, he'd be at a local bar that night with the guys
So why is he out on the highway with this gal?
Rough way to find out what your husband's up to
Unless Sally already knew Decided she'd had enough
Making her a person of interest number two
Between New York and Jersey, there's a lot of ink on you May
That's from way back
A DUI, arrest for loitering, solicitation?
I know what I did
Now you know why I ditched the cops that night
You didn't wanna get jammed up
Never mind helping find who killed your boyfriend Clem
He wasn't my boyfriend
Sayin' you weren't screwing' around?
I hadn't seen him in years
Well then how the heck do you end up on that highway with him, May?
I ran into Clem at Atlantic City that night
Told his wife he was at a Philly bar
I can't account for that
So, you run into him
We're talking about old times, we're both heading' back to Philly, he offers me a ride
- And?
- And we're almost there
Get bumped from behind
He pulls over Gets out
Gets shot Just like that
Clem talk about bein' in trouble?
Anything like that?
I don't know what his life was like
We'd said our goodbyes years earlier when we were just kids
1981
May Pierson shows up
What's one last shift
You're really goin', huh?
Leavin' for New York, 8 am
Not gonna wait for Petie to come get you?
Petie's a big college football star
He's never comin' back
You gonna marry Sally?
That's the plan
What if you came with me instead?
Come with you?
Remember that day we drove around playing 'Born To Run' until the tape broke?
Yeah, we ran out of gas
We could spend every day like that
I'm not like you, May
I'm not a big dream kind of person
But you are
I gotta stay
Well She sure is pretty
Bye, Mayflower
Just Married
That's how I like to remember Clem
'Cause when I saw him that night at Atlantic City, he'd turned into just another disappointed working guy
It happens
That's what I know
Now can I get back to Jersey?
So May Pierson gave us new details about your husband's murder
Like?
/ He was in Atlantic City that night Not in Philly, like he told you
Look, I know everyone thought
Clem must have been seein' her behind my back, but he wasn't
How do you know?
Clem wasn't perfect, but he was more good than bad
And when he was in something, he was in
When I was 19,
I took off with a guy 2 weeks into knowing' him
The heart wants what it wants
Yeah He was a biker, drinker But I thought this is it
Roll out the carpet, we're goin' down the aisle
You didn't go through with it?
We came close We were road trippin'
Went to a courthouse in Knoxville and we just sat out there on his bike
Neither one of us could get off
Well Clem and I never had any doubts / No?
Getting married was the happiest day of our lives
Anyone unhappy that day?
One person
1982
- Are you sorry?
- No, come on
I didn't want it to be this way
We were gonna have babies anyway
We're doin' the right thing, Sal
I'm gonna make you happy every day
What a frickin' joke
Petie, we didn't think you were coming
You two aren't foolin' anyone
Are you drinkin' this early?
You're just marrying here because she's knocked up OK, and everyone knows it
- Keep it down
- Pete you're acting really embarassing
Whoa, I'm embarassing?
I know who you really wanna be with
It's my girl May
What the hell happened to you?
What would happen?
I got my ass kicked out and I'm washed up and my girl's gone so you get everything and I get nothing
Hey start up my car
Me and my bride are pullin' outta here
Just Married
Petie had some kind of wall?
Somethin' went real wrong at Penn State
He dropped out, came home damaged good
Brought some strong feelings home
If it's true, that Clem was in Atlantic City that night?
/ Yeah?
Petie spent a lot of time there
So he could've run into Clem and May, and reacted badly?
I can't put it past him He's in jail now
I hear you made a spectacle of yourself at that wedding, Petie
Yeah, what a jerk
Pretty bitter about things going so good for Clem?
I was in a real bad way then
I just lost my free ride to Penn State
- I played ball, too
- Yeah?
What went wrong?
First game, I choked
Froze up on the field, did it all year Got cut
Couldn't've been easy comin' home after that / It wasn't
- People look at you like you're crap
- Including Clem?
No He was cool
I apologized for the wedding thing
We moved on Started hangin' out again
Were you surprised to hear that he was with May the night he died?
/ Yeah
- Everyone was
- Bother you at all?
- How do you mean?
- She was your girl, right?
I went with her in high school
So maybe you wanted to get back to that time
When you were a football star, and had your girl May
Not denying those were better times but 8 years later I wasn't thinkin' about May
- No?
- I was thinkin' about someone else 1985
* Glory Days by Bruce Springsteen *
9 seconds left and crazy Rick tosses me that screen pass
Yeah, I remember, me and Sal were on the field gettin' ready to do the homecoming thing
Caught that baby, turned on the jets
- That was something
- Crazy times, crazy times
Never been a prettier homecoming queen, Sal
You in that white dress
You remember that, huh?
Are you kidding me?
Everybody noticed
Someone got the best catch in school
I sure did
Who's that?
A guy I do favors for, make some cash
- I'd better get back to the baby
- I'll be home soon
Why is she so down?
Things have been kind of yippy at home
You know truthfully, man,
I don't know if me and Sal were ready for all this
So young
- It's probably just tough times, right?
- Yeah
No, man
- It's more than that
- You think she's sorry?
I think she wishes she didn't cry every night
So Clem and Sally were on the outs
Win or lose
I'll lay it out for you
Things between me and Sally kind of grew
So Sally and Petie started up
?
Clem their marriage was so great
That gives her motive if she wanted out for good
What about these favors that Petie was doing for money?
Breakin' legs, stealing cars Thug stuff
Clem ever get in on it?
Petie says he offered but Clem wouldn't go for it
The guy walked the line
Uh, anyway guys, good night
What's he nervous about?
Her
So they found who did the robberies?
Bobby Greene
Lived up the street He used to throw mudballs at our windows
- That little kid?
- He's grown up
- Criminal now
- Oh, God
He hit two other houses on the block but he got picked up this morning
That's sad
So, why didn't you come to me about this in the first place?
I knew you'd be busy
A long time to be less busy
You are who you are
I would like to think I've learned some things
- Anyway I
- Would you you wanna have dinner?
- Go to Irena's?
- Really?
- Yeah I'm free Friday
- Me, too
- 7?
- OK
OK
- All right, I'll see you
- OK
- 7
- Yeah
Clem made you happy every day
- Right Sally?
- Right
- Don't wanna revise that statement?
- Why would I?
How about because you were bangin' Petie
- That was wrong
- But it happened
And you not tellin' that, get's the wheels turnin'
Maybe you felt trapped
Things between you and Clem died out but he wouldn't give up
'Cause when he was in somethin' he was in / Look
I never had that kind of love again
So maybe I wanna remember things a certain way
But we don't live in that land, Sal
We got a real life murder to solve
That's true Things faded
And?
/ And it's true Clem wasn't one to give up
But he did Finally
1986
- Oh, man it's
- Valentine's Day
Baby, I'm sorry
- I was gonna get flowers and candy
- It doesn't matter
Let's go to bed, huh?
No
We ain't makin' it, are we Sal?
- Why can't we fix it?
- I don't know
It's just gone
But it was right
It was fun and easy and right
Yeah, it was
I don't wanna be a divorced person
Yeah, but do you wanna be this married person?
That's when Petie came into the picture?
It wasn't love
But he wanted to be with me
And Clem wanted to be somewhere else
By the time May came back to town, he knew he could go see her
May came back?
When her mother died Clem went to the funeral
I told you I hadn't seen Clem since high school
Oh, I know what you told me
His wife said he was at the funeral
Look, I didn't kill him
Then why lie to my face?
What are you hiding?
Me and Clem did a stupid desperate thing
Tried to get back something we'd never have again
I need to hear about that
I saw him at the funeral
And?
Everything rushed back
1987
Clem Garris shows up
Hey, Mayflower
I should get to the reception
Let me drive you
How'd New York go?
Not too good
How is that possible?
You're the best singer I've ever heard
Turns out a lot of people can sing
You going to that reception?
No Just keep drivin'
You got a guy there?
New York?
No Mostly just got debts
How you been gettin' by?
I don't wanna talk about it
OK
I just haven't been livin' right
What if we started over?
You and me
How?
/ Get out of here Just drive away
Like we should've done years ago
I loved you so much
Maybe it's still in you someplace
I know it's in me
I owe this guy
There's a job I can do
In Atlantic City, get you money
- And then clear out of here?
- Yeah, you and me Finally
We thought we could pick up where we left things all those years ago
But you can't go back
Learned that the hard way
So then you met in Atlantic City
He did this job and we went
Then the shooting happened
- What kind of job?
- Just said it was a favor for a guy
Looked into the dude Petie was doing favors for, he's a lowlife named Henry Mack
Probably who Clem got mixed up with
What's this Mack's line of work?
Had a ring of guys stealing cars, at airports, casinos, bringin' then back to his chop shop in Philly
So maybe Clem's doin' some runs for him that night
Maybe Petie knows more about that night than he's lettin' on
- You find this Mack?
- 6 feet under in Trenton
- Tough interview
- But there's a story to that
Guy was murdered, shot on a casino parking' lot
That connected to Clem somehow?
I'm guessin' because Mack was killed the very same night Clem was
I know Clem usually walked the line
Didn't get mixed up in the kind of favors you did
He kept his nose clean
Is that maybe just one time when he really needed the money?
- For May?
- Maybe
But that one time you two worked for Mack
Clem gets shot So does Mack / Uh-huh
It's kind of hard to miss what those murders have in common
- You
- I was a theif not a killer
You and Clem were stealing' those cars, maybe get ambitious?
- Decide to double cross Mack?
- No
But Clem was desperate
Maybe having' a runnin' buddy made you bold and Henry Mack
- probably deserved the pop in the head
- I don't know how Mack died
And after you two waste him, you panic
Word Clem's gonna fold 'cause he don't got a criminal nature, he walks the line
Clem was the one guy who was nice to me when I came home a mess!
Everyone else kept away
He stayed my friend
So be a friend to him, Petie
Say what happened that night
He didn't wanna be dirty
But it was his only ticket out
1988
* Stolen Car by Bruce Springsteen *
* I found me a little girl and I settled down * * in a pretty little house in a pretty little town *
* We got married, and promised never to part * * then little by little we drifted from each other's heart *
* Now I'm driving a stolen car * * down on a pitch black night *
* And I'm doing my best to make it through *
* Well I'm just sittin' down here at a Stanton light *
* I wanna get caught but I never do *
* At first I thought it was just restlessness * * that would fade as time went by * * and our love grew deep *
* But in the end it was something more I guess * * that tore us apart and made us weep *
* And I'm driving a stolen car * * waitin' on that little red light *
* I keep tellin' myself everything's gonna be alright *
* But I ride by night and I travel in fear *
* That in this darkness I might just disappear *
* She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote *
* When our love was young and we were bold *
* She said last night she read those letters *
* And they made her feel one hundred years old *
* As the river runs by the little town * * down into the sea * * it was there in the shade I let my body down*
I'm out, Petie
No if you wanna get paid, we gotta go to Philly
I'm takin' the car
- What?
- Forget the money
No, it's no good, Clem Mack won't go fot that
Mack's not gonna find me
Be good to her
He went off to get May
That's it
The '69 Chevy, huh?
It was a beauty
Yeah I've seen it
You're still driving the same car you and Clem took out of Atlantic City
And the only person who knew where Clem was going that night?
- Petie
- It wasn't Petie
- Who then?
- A guy Clem called him Mack
There had to be two people, May Someone drove that second car away
And somehow the Chevy ended up back with you
You would'nt've given us Mack right off
Unless it was someone you wanted to protect
Maybe you and Petie need to talk
Hey, Mayflower!
Hi, Petie boy
May IDed Henry Mack from a photo spread as the shooter
So we know he was one of our guys at the scene
But we still got the matter of who was with him
And who killed him later that night
You ever make it with singing'?
I'm just a cocktail waitress
So May says you two made a promise
Back when Clem died
Yeah
I'll keep it Petie I'm not scared
It's over for me But you can still have a good life
What happens?
After Clem takes off in that Chevy?
He finds trouble All because of me
We both had our part in it
- You think you can steal from me?
- Mack
Take their car Meet me back there
You gave him up?
He was gonna kill me
- Get in the car and drive!
- OK, OK
* One Step Up Bruce Springsteen *
* Woke up this morning my house was cold * * checked the furnace, she wasn't burning *

* It's the same thing night on night * * who's wrong, baby, who's right?
*
* Another fight and I slam the door on * * another battle in our dirty little war *
* When I look at myself I don't see the man I wanted to be *

The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event
- Are we going to that party tonight?
- Yeah
Man, forget about that party, just keep driving right out of Philly
What's wrong with Philly?
May's got her big plans
Singing, huh?
She's gonna cut some place of her own in New York City
Why do you wanna go to New York?
You don't know anyone there
I know everyone here
I bet she makes it

- Would you you wanna have dinner?
- Go to Irena's?
- Really?
- Yeah I'm free Friday
- Me, too
- 7?
- OK
OK
- All right, I'll see you
- OK
- 7
- Yeah
Clem made you happy every day
- Right Sally?
- Right
- Don't wanna revise that statement?
- Why would I?
How about because you were bangin' Petie
- That was wrong
- But it happened
And you not tellin' that, get's the wheels turnin'
Maybe you felt trapped
Things between you and Clem died out but he wouldn't give up
'Cause when he was in somethin' he was in / Look
I never had that kind of love again
So maybe I wanna remember things a certain way
But we don't live in that land, Sal
We got a real life murder to solve
That's true Things faded
And?
/ And it's true Clem wasn't one to give up
But he did Finally
1986
- Oh, man it's
- Valentine's Day
Baby, I'm sorry
- I was gonna get flowers and candy
- It doesn't matter
Let's go to bed, huh?
No
We ain't makin' it, are we Sal?
- Why can't we fix it?
- I don't know
It's just gone
But it was right
It was fun and easy and right
Yeah, it was
I don't wanna be a divorced person
Yeah, but do you wanna be this married person?
That's when Petie came into the picture?
It wasn't love
But he wanted to be with me
And Clem wanted to be somewhere else
By the time May came back to town, he knew he could go see her
May came back?
When her mother died Clem went to the funeral
I told you I hadn't seen Clem since high school
Oh, I know what you told me
His wife said he was at the funeral
Look, I didn't kill him
Then why lie to my face?
What are you hiding?
Me and Clem did a stupid desperate thing
Tried to get back something we'd never have again
I need to hear about that
I saw him at the funeral
And?
Everything rushed back
1987
Clem Garris shows up
Hey, Mayflower
I should get to the reception
Let me drive you
How'd New York go?
Not too good
How is that possible?
You're the best singer I've ever heard
Turns out a lot of people can sing
You going to that reception?
No Just keep drivin'
You got a guy there?
New York?
No Mostly just got debts
How you been gettin' by?
I don't wanna talk about it
OK
I just haven't been livin' right
What if we started over?
You and me
How?
/ Get out of here Just drive away
Like we should've done years ago
I loved you so much
Maybe it's still in you someplace
I know it's in me
I owe this guy
There's a job I can do
In Atlantic City, get you money
- And then clear out of here?
- Yeah, you and me Finally
We thought we could pick up where we left things all those years ago
But you can't go back
Learned that the hard way
So then you met in Atlantic City
He did this job and we went
Then the shooting happened
- What kind of job?
- Just said it was a favor for a guy
Looked into the dude Petie was doing favors for, he's a lowlife named Henry Mack
Probably who Clem got mixed up with
What's this Mack's line of work?
Had a ring of guys stealing cars, at airports, casinos, bringin' then back to his chop shop in Philly
So maybe Clem's doin' some runs for him that night
Maybe Petie knows more about that night than he's lettin' on
- You find this Mack?
- 6 feet under in Trenton
- Tough interview
- But there's a story to that
Guy was murdered, shot on a casino parking' lot
That connected to Clem somehow?
I'm guessin' because Mack was killed the very same night Clem was
I know Clem usually walked the line
Didn't get mixed up in the kind of favors you did
He kept his nose clean
Is that maybe just one time when he really needed the money?
- For May?
- Maybe
But that one time you two worked for Mack
Clem gets shot So does Mack / Uh-huh
It's kind of hard to miss what those murders have in common
- You
- I was a theif not a killer
You and Clem were stealing' those cars, maybe get ambitious?
- Decide to double cross Mack?
- No
But Clem was desperate
Maybe having' a runnin' buddy made you bold and Henry Mack
- probably deserved the pop in the head
- I don't know how Mack died
And after you two waste him, you panic
Word Clem's gonna fold 'cause he don't got a criminal nature, he walks the line
Clem was the one guy who was nice to me when I came home a mess!
Everyone else kept away
He stayed my friend
So be a friend to him, Petie
Say what happened that night
He didn't wanna be dirty
But it was his only ticket out
1988
* Stolen Car by Bruce Springsteen *
* I found me a little girl and I settled down * * in a pretty little house in a pretty little town *
* We got married, and promised never to part * * then little by little we drifted from each other's heart *
* Now I'm driving a stolen car * * down on a pitch black night *

* I wanna get caught but I never do *
* At first I thought it was just restlessness * * that would fade as time went by * * and our love grew deep *
* But in the end it was something more I guess * * that tore us apart and made us weep *
* And I'm driving a stolen car * * waitin' on that little red light *
* I keep tellin' myself everything's gonna be alright *
* But I ride by night and I travel in fear *
* That in this darkness I might just disappear *
* She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote *
* When our love was young and we were bold *

I'm out, Petie
No if you wanna get paid, we gotta go to Philly
I'm takin' the car
- What?
- Forget the money
No, it's no good, Clem Mack won't go fot that
Mack's not gonna find me
Be good to her
He went off to get May
That's it
The '69 Chevy, huh?
It was a beauty
Yeah I've seen it
You're still driving the same car you and Clem took out of Atlantic City
And the only person who knew where Clem was going that night?
- Petie
- It wasn't Petie
- Who then?
- A guy Clem called him Mack
There had to be two people, May Someone drove that second car away
And somehow the Chevy ended up back with you
You would'nt've given us Mack right off
Unless it was someone you wanted to protect
Maybe you and Petie need to talk
Hey, Mayflower!
Hi, Petie boy
May IDed Henry Mack from a photo spread as the shooter
So we know he was one of our guys at the scene
But we still got the matter of who was with him
And who killed him later that night
You ever make it with singing'?
I'm just a cocktail waitress
So May says you two made a promise
Back when Clem died
Yeah
I'll keep it Petie I'm not scared
It's over for me But you can still have a good life
What happens?
After Clem takes off in that Chevy?
He finds trouble All because of me
We both had our part in it
- You think you can steal from me?
- Mack
Take their car Meet me back there
You gave him up?
He was gonna kill me
- Get in the car and drive!
- OK, OK

The following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event
- Are we going to that party tonight?
- Yeah
Man, forget about that party, just keep driving right out of Philly
What's wrong with Philly?
May's got her big plans
Singing, huh?
She's gonna cut some place of her own in New York City
Why do you wanna go to New York?
You don't know anyone there
I know everyone here
I bet she makes it
We won't hear from her ever again except for on the radio
My Daddy says if you plan big you'll just disappoint yourself
- Yeah, well I got plans that involve you
- You do?
Oh, crap, get a room
8 Years Later
So this chick went AWAL after a highway shooting in '88?
Yeah, the guy she was with was killed
She got winged, skipped out of the hospital before the cops could interview her
Now someone dropped a dime?
Old classmate saw her on the boardwalk last week
Man, what is that?
- Rice cake
- All right
- May Pierson
- Yeah
Philadelphia Homicide
I don't have anything to do with anything
That's a pretty broad claim
I've been up all night, I can't be doing this
Doing what, May?
You don't even know what it's about
- Or do you?
- Clem Garris
Shot on the expressway in '88, you were there
'Till you fled
No That was another girl
So you're not May Pierson?
That works at this fine establishment and drives this vehicle?
I'm sayin' that was a lifetime ago
Yeah, we gotta talk about it
- Forget it, I'm goin' home
- This ain't a debate, May, we got a warrant We do this here or do it in Philly
You can't take me there, on what basis?
Obstructing a police investigation '88, New York bench warrant '94
And irritating two homicide guys, 2006 Get in the car
Philadelphia Police Department Central Division
Were you in court this morning?
Cat emergency,
Olivia got chomped by a neighbor dog
You get the ?
That's not funny
Rita
Hi, John
I almost came by, I didn't wanna bother you
Lilly Rush, Rita Hart
Formerly Stillman
Oh, hi Um I'll see you later, boss
So, what brings you here?
- House got robbed last night
- No kiddin'?
Yeah, I just reported it
Was Joel with you?
Joel moved out
Few months ago
- The drinking?
- Yeah
- Sorry
- It's better
I'll talk to major crimes, have them fast track it / OK
- Give you a call
- Thanks
Clem Garris shot and killed January '88, found on the shoulder of I-76
But not alone
No, that's the scandelous part, he was found with a woman not his wife
May Pierson Was shot in the arm, slipped out of the ER before the cops could get a play by play
But Vera and Valens picked her up this morning
Got her upstairs
Leaves the scene and doesn't turn up for 18 years?
- That's a person of interest
- At least
Clem told his wife Sally, he'd be at a local bar that night with the guys
So why is he out on the highway with this gal?
Rough way to find out what your husband's up to
Unless Sally already knew Decided she'd had enough
Making her a person of interest number two
Between New York and Jersey, there's a lot of ink on you May
That's from way back
A DUI, arrest for loitering, solicitation?
I know what I did
Now you know why I ditched the cops that night
You didn't wanna get jammed up
Never mind helping find who killed your boyfriend Clem
He wasn't my boyfriend
Sayin' you weren't screwing' around?
I hadn't seen him in years
Well then how the heck do you end up on that highway with him, May?
I ran into Clem at Atlantic City that night
Told his wife he was at a Philly bar
I can't account for that
So, you run into him
We're talking about old times, we're both heading' back to Philly, he offers me a ride
- And?
- And we're almost there
Get bumped from behind
He pulls over Gets out
Gets shot Just like that
Clem talk about bein' in trouble?
Anything like that?
I don't know what his life was like
We'd said our goodbyes years earlier when we were just kids
May Pierson shows up
What's one last shift
You're really goin', huh?
Leavin' for New York, 8 am
Not gonna wait for Petie to come get you?
Petie's a big college football star
He's never comin' back
You gonna marry Sally?
That's the plan
What if you came with me instead?
Come with you?
Remember that day we drove around playing 'Born To Run' until the tape broke?
Yeah, we ran out of gas
We could spend every day like that
I'm not like you, May
I'm not a big dream kind of person
But you are
I gotta stay
Well She sure is pretty
Bye, Mayflower
Just Married
That's how I like to remember Clem
'Cause when I saw him that night at Atlantic City, he'd turned into just another disappointed working guy
It happens
That's what I know
Now can I get back to Jersey?
So May Pierson gave us new details about your husband's murder
Like?
/ He was in Atlantic City that night Not in Philly, like he told you
Look, I know everyone thought
Clem must have been seein' her behind my back, but he wasn't
How do you know?
Clem wasn't perfect, but he was more good than bad
And when he was in something, he was in
When I was 19,
I took off with a guy 2 weeks into knowing' him
The heart wants what it wants
Yeah He was a biker, drinker But I thought this is it
Roll out the carpet, we're goin' down the aisle
You didn't go through with it?
We came close We were road trippin'
Went to a courthouse in Knoxville and we just sat out there on his bike
Neither one of us could get off
Well Clem and I never had any doubts / No?
Getting married was the happiest day of our lives
Anyone unhappy that day?
One person
- Are you sorry?
- No, come on
I didn't want it to be this way
We were gonna have babies anyway
We're doin' the right thing, Sal
I'm gonna make you happy every day
What a frickin' joke
Petie, we didn't think you were coming
You two aren't foolin' anyone
Are you drinkin' this early?
You're just marrying here because she's knocked up OK, and everyone knows it
- Keep it down
- Pete you're acting really embarassing
Whoa, I'm embarassing?
I know who you really wanna be with
It's my girl May
What the hell happened to you?
What would happen?
I got my ass kicked out and I'm washed up and my girl's gone so you get everything and I get nothing
Hey start up my car
Me and my bride are pullin' outta here
Just Married
Petie had some kind of wall?
Somethin' went real wrong at Penn State
He dropped out, came home damaged good
Brought some strong feelings home
If it's true, that Clem was in Atlantic City that night?
/ Yeah?
Petie spent a lot of time there
So he could've run into Clem and May, and reacted badly?
I can't put it past him He's in jail now
I hear you made a spectacle of yourself at that wedding, Petie
Yeah, what a jerk
Pretty bitter about things going so good for Clem?
I was in a real bad way then
I just lost my free ride to Penn State
- I played ball, too
- Yeah?
What went wrong?
First game, I choked
Froze up on the field, did it all year Got cut
Couldn't've been easy comin' home after that / It wasn't
- People look at you like you're crap
- Including Clem?
No He was cool
I apologized for the wedding thing
We moved on Started hangin' out again
Were you surprised to hear that he was with May the night he died?
/ Yeah
- Everyone was
- Bother you at all?
- How do you mean?
- She was your girl, right?
I went with her in high school
So maybe you wanted to get back to that time
When you were a football star, and had your girl May
Not denying those were better times but 8 years later I wasn't thinkin' about May
- No?
- I was thinkin' about someone else
* Glory Days by Bruce Springsteen *
9 seconds left and crazy Rick tosses me that screen pass
Yeah, I remember, me and Sal were on the field gettin' ready to do the homecoming thing
Caught that baby, turned on the jets
- That was something
- Crazy times, crazy times
Never been a prettier homecoming queen, Sal
You in that white dress
You remember that, huh?
Are you kidding me?
Everybody noticed
Someone got the best catch in school
I sure did
Who's that?
A guy I do favors for, make some cash
- I'd better get back to the baby
- I'll be home soon
Why is she so down?
Things have been kind of yippy at home
You know truthfully, man,
I don't know if me and Sal were ready for all this
So young
- It's probably just tough times, right?
- Yeah
No, man
- It's more than that
- You think she's sorry?
I think she wishes she didn't cry every night
So Clem and Sally were on the outs
Win or lose
I'll lay it out for you
Things between me and Sally kind of grew
So Sally and Petie started up
?
Clem their marriage was so great
That gives her motive if she wanted out for good
What about these favors that Petie was doing for money?
Breakin' legs, stealing cars Thug stuff
Clem ever get in on it?
Petie says he offered but Clem wouldn't go for it
The guy walked the line
Uh, anyway guys, good night
What's he nervous about?
Her
So they found who did the robberies?
Bobby Greene
Lived up the street He used to throw mudballs at our windows
- That little kid?
- He's grown up
- Criminal now
- Oh, God
He hit two other houses on the block but he got picked up this morning
That's sad
So, why didn't you come to me about this in the first place?
I knew you'd be busy
A long time to be less busy
You are who you are
I would like to think I've learned some things
- Anyway I
- Would you you wanna have dinner?
- Go to Irena's?
- Really?
- Yeah I'm free Friday
- Me, too
- 7?
- OK
OK
- All right, I'll see you
- OK
- 7
- Yeah
Clem made you happy every day
- Right Sally?
- Right
- Don't wanna revise that statement?
- Why would I?
How about because you were bangin' Petie
- That was wrong
- But it happened
And you not tellin' that, get's the wheels turnin'
Maybe you felt trapped
Things between you and Clem died out but he wouldn't give up
'Cause when he was in somethin' he was in / Look
I never had that kind of love again
So maybe I wanna remember things a certain way
But we don't live in that land, Sal
We got a real life murder to solve
That's true Things faded
And?
/ And it's true Clem wasn't one to give up
But he did Finally
- Oh, man it's
- Valentine's Day
Baby, I'm sorry
- I was gonna get flowers and candy
- It doesn't matter
Let's go to bed, huh?
No
We ain't makin' it, are we Sal?
- Why can't we fix it?
- I don't know
It's just gone
But it was right
It was fun and easy and right
Yeah, it was
I don't wanna be a divorced person
Yeah, but do you wanna be this married person?
That's when Petie came into the picture?
It wasn't love
But he wanted to be with me
And Clem wanted to be somewhere else
By the time May came back to town, he knew he could go see her
May came back?
When her mother died Clem went to the funeral
I told you I hadn't seen Clem since high school
Oh, I know what you told me
His wife said he was at the funeral
Look, I didn't kill him
Then why lie to my face?
What are you hiding?
Me and Clem did a stupid desperate thing
Tried to get back something we'd never have again
I need to hear about that
I saw him at the funeral
And?
Everything rushed back
Clem Garris shows up
Hey, Mayflower
I should get to the reception
Let me drive you
How'd New York go?
Not too good
How is that possible?
You're the best singer I've ever heard
Turns out a lot of people can sing
You going to that reception?
No Just keep drivin'
You got a guy there?
New York?
No Mostly just got debts
How you been gettin' by?
I don't wanna talk about it

Skeletal boardwalks across the ocean.
Now you try.
Whoa.
Hold on.
I got to get plugged in.
Hey, where's the plug-in part?
Back from the beginning, please.
[videotape rewinding] [playing electric guitar]
Um...
Rewind again.
[videotape rewinding] [playing electric guitar]
Damn it!
I'm so close.
Take it back one more time.
You missed the first half of the first note.
...You're a dick.
[plays note]
Yeah!
This is how you do it.
Can you all keep it down, please?
Shut up, and listen to the wail of my banshee fingers.
[playing electric guitar]
What are you making?
A time machine.
That's dumb.
Really?
Yes.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, have you ever gone back in time?
I farted my way out of an elevator.
That's not the same thing.
What's that thing on your face?
Huh?
Oh.
Probably a zit or something.
Well, look, I'm no doctor, but that right there looks like a...
Melanoma.
Well, it does kind of--
Beef Bologna.
Will you get out of here?
!
Damn it!
I'm hitting the notes.
You know, it's the guitar.
give me that.
[playing riffs]
No.
Now, this action is good.
I think the problem is your hands.
You've got some baby hands.
This is totally going to work.
Ok.
I'm inside, and I got the doors and windows closed.
Go on and do it.
Roger that.
Ooh...
How's that feel?
Ow!
I can feel it getting bigger.
They look like they're getting you in the eyeballs, too.
Well...
I know that.
Ow!
If I rip any solos with my eyeballs,
I'm going to need the bees to enlarge them.
Otherwise, I'd get on stage and look like a big asshole, and I am not that.
Uh!
Shake!
Shake!
Are you all right?
I've never been better.
Whoa.
What's up with that face, man?
Nothing.
What do you mean?
You tried to cover it up with makeup, like a girl.
Can you tell?
Really?
Yeah.
You look like... [clears throat]
You ought to get that thing checked out.
Every year, I get me a physical.
Oh, really?
And who's your doctor?
Dr. John.
Olivia Newton John.
?
I get a physical, physical ?
On your face, boy on your face ?
Please.
Look, he's just playing around.
But I'm serious.
You will soon be paying to see me in a concert!
I'm going to be honest with you.
I don't like the look of this at all.
So it's not an ingrown hair?
Oh, no, no.
It's irregular, which means some sort of sun damage probably.
Really?
We'll biopsy it and have some results for you within the week.
I mean, it's probably nothing, right?
Well...
Let's hope not.
Magazine war!
"Better Homes and Garden, one."
Foul!
Eat my "Redbook!"
Better Homes and Garden, 2."
Hey!
There he is.
There's the man.
This guy's got the biggest genital warts I've ever seen in my life.
Would you stop it, Shake?
I am not in the mood for this, ok?
That's it.
Now, who wants to make history and go back in time?
Yeah.
We're busy.
Eat it.
You eat it.
You can meet
President Lincoln.
Lincoln is dead.
I'll eat it...
If you eat it.
All right.
Deal.
Wait a minute.
How are you going to eat it after I eat it?
Look, you eat it.
Then I'll go back in time to before the time when you eat it.
Then I'll eat it.
Ok.
[gulp] [telephone rings]
Hello.
Oh.
Oh, hey, doc.
[choking]
Really?
It's stuck in the back of my throat.
Ok.
Well, it can be cut out, right?
Additional treatment?
Uh-huh.
[choking continues]
Oh, uh...
Chemotherapy.
Ok.
Thank you.
What did your doctor say?
He says I have cancer.
Well, did you tell him that you don't?
Meatwad, I'm afraid it doesn't work that way.
What's wrong with him?
He's dead.
Dumb-ass ate a scorpion.
So when will you find out about the blood test?
it won't be for another week, but you're looking good.
You're looking good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Thanks.
Stay strong, ok?
We'll see you on Tuesday.
He's coming!
He's coming!
Turn off the lights!
We didn't pay no electric bill.
Perfect.
Shh.
Shh.
Quiet.
Surprise!
Surprise!
?
Party, party, party
I want to have a party ?
All right.
Andrew W.K.
Live in our living room.
?
You gotta party hearty
I'm gonna have a party and everyone will come party, party, party the party's getting started
I know what kind of party-- ?
[door slams]
Oh, God.
He looks like he's dead already.
Thanks, Carl.
Appreciate that.
I think the problem was the song.
You got any other...
You know, happier songs about partying?
?
Party, party, party ?
Hey!
Let's party!
Let's have a party tonight!
Will you get out of here?
[coughing]
Look, my doctor says
I need to get as much rest as possible, ok?
Yeah.
Hey.
Get the funk outta here!
And I am now leaving as well.
What are we gonna do if...
What if Frylock dies?
Don't say that.
Don't you ever say that.
Don't you understand?
He's in this all by himself.
He needs for us to be strong for him.
And we need him to know that we are going to be right by his side through this till the end.
I just don't know what I would do.
Come here.
He'll be fine.
He's going to be fine.
He always did so much for me.
I can't be here right now.
Wait.
I have an idea.
Gentlemen, we have a time machine, and this is the key to Frylock's health.
We can break it apart, light it on fire, and smoke the Cancer out.
But don't smoking, like, cause Cancer?
That has never been proven.
Do whatever the hell you want.
I don't care.
Frylock, you come back.
I must cure you.
Damn it!
Guys, I'm not supposed to be out in the sun.
I know, buddy.
But, uh...
Well...
I could...
I mean,
I could blow up the sun.
That's it!
I will blow up the sun!
Where are you going?
[coughing deeply]
I really appreciate you letting me stay here for a while, Carl.
Yeah.
No problem.
Anything, really.
When...
How long did they-- did they say you had?
They don't know.
I supposed to meet with my doctor today.
Sometime this month you think, or...
I don't know, Carl.
Probably.
So definitely probably not this week?
Just ballpark it for me.
I don't know.
[coughing]
You're not like...
Wiping Cancer all over my couch, right?
You know, you really don't have to wear that.
I know that.
I figure, you know,
I got house guests, so...
A good idea to keep the pants on.
Don't want to embarrass you 'cause I got that big baby arm clutching an apple.
Ha ha ha!
Hanging low!
Give us a sausage!
Ha ha ha!
Ok.
Comedy doesn't work today.
Hey, time to destroy the sun right now, buddy, and it's all for you, baby.
Frylock forever!
Light it up, Meatwad!
I already done it, like, 5 minutes ago.
I need my goggles!
I need my U.V. Ray goggles!
[boom]
Well, we got your blood work back.
And?
No apparent trace of Cancer in the lymph nodes.
Oh, God, thank you.
You have no idea how great that is to hear.
But, uh...
Listen.
Aliens.
What?
Yeah.
The aliens are coming for us, you and I.
That's why we must merge as one together to defeat them and their lasers.
Hello?
Mr. Lock?
Well, we got your bloodwork back.
And?
No apparent trace of Cancer in the lymph nodes.
Oh, God.
Thank you.
You have no idea how great that is to hear.
But listen...
I want you to stay out of the sun, plenty of rest, and I want to schedule another visit for you in 2 months.
All right.
No problem.
We're not out of the woods yet.
All right, then.
Give me a sweet party party, party, party you've got a party
I want a party who's gonna get this party started?
Me!
Previously on The West Wing:
Santos could take a vacation and just let the press keep hammering me on this nuclear thing.
Ohio trends Santos!
That's the story of the day.
The voters set the terms of the elections, not us.
They get to decide what's important, not us.
If I win California, I win the country.
We need to be prepared for a court battle.
- You think we're gonna win?
- I do.
The real decision the American people have to make is who do they want as their next commander in chief.
- We're tied.
- Holy mother of God, we caught him!
- Yes!
- We caught him!
Scotch, please.
Your best.
I need seven glasses.
And I'll keep the bottle.
I'd believe we were in Houston if I saw more cowboy hats.
- It's rude indoors.
- Maybe it's a stereotype.
- It could be Denver.
Could be St. Louis.
- Chicago.
Phoenix, Salt Lake City.
All that time we spent there.
You have to accept the fact that this is all coming to an end tomorrow.
And a single tear slips slowly down your cheek.
Or you can get really hammered.
Everybody needs to relax.
Except you.
The bartender needs your credit card.
So who's planned for the rest of their lives?
I want a meal that isn't Cheetos and a Diet Sprite.
- I want a pedicure.
- I wanna be a White House speechwriter.
- Don't say that out loud.
- Bad karma, man.
- Then Cheetos sounds good.
- I'd settle for more than two hours' sleep.
- Where was the bat loose in the hall?
- That you caught with a pillowcase?
- That one.
- Portland.
A hundred and seventy-five dollars a bottle?
Next time, get a pitcher of whatever's on tap.
Next time?
The congressman will be wrapping up in L.A.
Who wants to stay sober long enough to get the report from Bram?
Thanks for volunteering, Edie.
- Think I'm gonna call it a night.
- So early?
God created few nights in life without midnight rallies airplane seats and tracking polls.
I'm gonna enjoy one.
Staff meeting, 6 a.m. Tomorrow.
We'll go over new marching orders then.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You know, I think that's it for me too.
So I'll send out an e-mail about L.A. later.
- Really?
- Apparently.
- Should you be drinking like that?
- Like what?
You're 23 years old with a shocking lack of facial hair.
Do you really wanna tell a grown woman how to drink?
I didn't think so.
Bedtime.
You can take the bottle if you want.
Yeah me too.
See you guys in the morning.
- How did I miss that?
- You might've had an easier year of it if you had come onboard.
- Six o'clock tomorrow morning, right?
- Yeah.
Wow, Cindy?
- Did you know that?
- About Ronna and Cindy?
- Any of them.
- Yes.
- Which one?
- All of them.
Did you ever come onboard?
No.
Never had a campaign fling?
No.
Do you want another drink?
No.
- It's 3 a.m.
- Yeah.
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little.
You?
Yeah.
- You don't have to leave.
- I know.
- I mean, you don't have to sneak out.
- I wasn't.
I didn't wanna make this awkward, but I just did.
I was just checking the news sites.
- And the sweater?
- For warmth.
Why don't I go get us some coffee?
- How are you feeling?
- I really wanna win this thing.
- Coffee would be great.
Cream and...
- Three sugars.
I already checked AP.
Nothing new.
You should take a look at Reuters.
Scotch, Otto, exercise.
You should rehydrate.
I was hoping to escape you for a little while.
Well, the front-desk clerk gave you up.
He say, "Lou's on the treadmill, go seek her out"?
He said he opened the gym for a lady with liquor breath and crazy eyes.
- What do you got there?
- Vinick made a crack last night about the congressman's lack of foreign-policy experience.
Well, it's hard to effectively fire back at him on Election Day.
Only two and a half hours before the polls open in the East.
Yeah.
"Thank you all for joining me in Houston on this historic evening.
Tonight, I'm both honored and humbled by the certitude..."
Hey, no one actually uses the word "certitude."
Not really.
You couldn't sleep either?
Final pass at the victory and concession speeches.
It was either this or a solitaire tournament with the Advance guys.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Welcome to the club.
- No one can sleep.
- Evidently.
- You see Reuters?
Vinick said the congressman couldn't handle the Kazakhstan crisis last night.
Well, a response won't do much good now but we've got Bartlet cabinet members doing satellite spin.
They can mention our guy's military experience.
- All right, great.
- Would you check on this for me?
Thanks.
Tell me you found my pantyhose.
Thank you.
- This is it.
- It's less glamorous than I imagined.
We sold the leather couches for our last media buy.
Funny man.
Pretty witty.
Makes me want to...
- I should check the fax.
- I already did.
You got nothing better to do at 4 in the morning?
Apparently not.
- Jane Braun, Carrie...?
- Marino.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- Senator hit Santos on Kazakhstan.
- Yeah, I saw.
- It may be too little, too late.
- Well, it was worth a shot.
- When's he landing?
- An hour and a half at LAX then up to Santa Paula to vote.
- Yeah.
Bathroom?
- Oh, it's...
left.
- Oh, second door on your left.
Thank you.
- She's cute.
- Yeah.
- Little young.
- Yale grad.
Almost grad.
- Couldn't sleep.
- Oh, sure.
God, I hate the waiting.
- Say something.
- Nothing to say.
Someone should tell me to change my shirt or not to change the health-care section of the speech or where we're going next.
- We're going to vote and then home.
- The stump speech?
- Delivered for the last time.
- And we're not running late?
- Right on time.
Unbelievable.
- Hey, you look great.
- I changed.
- Yeah, I noticed.
- Thanks.
- Teddy's got the war room running?
- Yeah.
I didn't want to be wearing the same clothes as last night.
How's our Get Out the Vote effort looking?
Great, I hope.
You don't have to worry.
A lot of people are gonna be doing the walk of shame today.
Not that what we did was shameful.
Or is shameful.
That's not what I meant.
- So...
- Here's everything we talked about.
250,000 volunteers nationwide knocking on doors, escorting voters to the polls.
- Where are the surrogates?
- We've got surrogates doing news in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and California.
- Russell?
- He's in Colorado today but he's available for satellites.
Griffith, Atkins and Baker are available to fly wherever we need them depending on the polls.
- Hispanic vote?
Radio spots targeting largely Hispanic counties in California and Florida.
The congressman will hit Texas today with some drive-time radio.
- Right.
- We got it completely handled, Josh.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Really?
- Really.
This is it.
The wait begins.
Well, it's about time for you to do your thing.
- My thing?
- Thank the troops.
You did realize you were gonna have to do that.
Right, right.
Hey, everyone.
Gather round.
I didn't know most of you before last January, and...
Wow, it's been a long 11 months.
I hope you've all learned a lot.
I know that I learned a few things from you.
For instance, I didn't know that I would need to explain that we don't do shout-outs during radio interviews.
And we don't encourage college buddies to hurl expletives at our opponent.
Who was responsible for that thing in Dubuque, anyway?
Who was it?
- Dave.
- Dave.
Dave, Dave.
Take a bow.
You fired him.
Well, wherever you are, thanks for the lesson.
It's a special day.
A high point in your young, impressionable lives.
So go, take a few minutes to enjoy it.
And then call your family and friends.
Make sure they voted.
Ask about the lines at their precincts so we know if Get Out the Vote works.
They can report any harassment, anything weird.
Or if it's snowing, whatever.
They can tell you that.
I'm serious.
Call them.
- Good group.
- Yeah.
You might wanna work the phrase "thank you" in there.
- Thank you.
Appreciate it.
- Okey-dokey.
Polls open in five, four, three two, one.
Senator Arnold Vinick's campaign made its final stop of the election season here in Santa Paula, California.
Senator Vinick returns to his hometown with a different goal...
Come in.
- Breakfast.
- Are we going steady?
- You called me.
- The speeches.
You approved them.
One if we win, one if we lose.
- We might need another one.
- Isn't it black and white?
We placed a lot of emphasis on him being the first Hispanic candidate.
We need one in case he doesn't sweep the Hispanic vote.
- Okay.
- You know, be prepared.
Great.
Are you waiting for a hug or something?
- Isn't going to go down without a fight.
Thank you.
California, Nevada, Washington, Idaho.
Polls are now open everywhere.
Alaska and Hawaii aren't open yet.
Two states on which the outcome of the race so often depends.
Like Idaho was ever the linchpin.
Senator's voting, then meeting his daughter for breakfast.
- Anybody ready to order lunch?
- The sun came up an hour ago.
I'm starving.
The Hispanic turnout in Florida?
Swenson's been out all morning.
We got 10,000 volunteers in Jacksonville, Orlando and Miami.
- And Get Out the Vote is...?
- What's this?
He's just voting now?
- We now go live to Houston.
- It's 9 a.m. In Texas.
He missed morning coverage in the East.
Yeah, but he cut into our California coverage perfectly.
After hosting a rally in Los Angeles...
- They'll switch from Vinick to Santos.
- Lou's a genius.
How was last night?
He changed the health-care portion of the stump again but otherwise, 45,000 screaming devotees.
Kind of cult-like.
How is he today?
- He's relaxed.
- You're kidding?
No, it's kind of weird, calm.
We're heading back to the house.
- How long to the first exit polls?
- Couple of hours.
I can 't tell you how badly I need a shower.
Four rallies in four states, four buses, three flights.
- You can probably smell me...
- Hold on.
Boston!
We need turnout in Boston, huge turnout.
Vinick will win western Massachusetts.
He's gonna take Cape Cod.
Need to up the score in Boston.
- Yeah.
- It's raining.
Yeah, well, she beat you to the punch.
Though we were already monitoring road conditions and traffic patterns.
The Massachusetts field ops called, said they are distributing umbrellas so volunteers can escort voters from cars to polling places.
- Should we do some additional...
- Drive-time?
Scheduled for 3:00.
The National Weather Service said there's a high-pressure system coming.
It should stop the rain by 2:00.
Good news is, showers should linger over the Berkshires slowing down any Vinick supporters still getting to the polls.
We're getting new weather models every half hour.
- You wanna see them?
- No, we're fine.
Don't need it.
Josh, we are completely and totally under control.
We've been planning this for five months.
You know what?
I was in the elevator today.
I was talking to a man who didn't even know it was Election Day.
Jeremy, ride the elevator for a few hours.
Anyone from Houston, remind them to vote.
I was thinking, we should do an additional speech.
- One in the event...
- Hispanic vote draft.
Wanna take a look?
- The popular vote is different from the Electoral College vote.
Another if...
I got you.
You want two speeches.
One if we win the electoral and lose the popular and the vice versa.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
Two more?
- Two more.
Do two.
You're right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Drew.
What are you doing right now?
Bram asked me to make sure everything's going smoothly for the party tonight.
- They're about to do sound checks.
- Cool.
You mind if I come along with you?
Sure.
If you're heading toward my office, you should rethink that.
- Job offers.
- Talk to me about the election.
- No word yet on the exit polls.
- Fine.
Margaret's been setting up meetings with employers.
I took it upon myself to do research.
She's supposed to schedule them in January.
CEOs are busy.
They schedule January meetings in November.
Board of Directors at Johnson Johnson Lockheed Martin, Boeing, SBC.
President of Human Resources at GE.
Kennedy School needs a new dean.
Everyone wants you.
- Is today the day for this?
- One has offices in Prague but you have to be fluent in Czech.
Another, a company jet.
Not Air Force One, but not bad.
A lot have stock options, something you should look into.
Suckers could be worth something someday.
Three thousand people have been invited.
Thirty thousand are gonna try to make it through the door.
Well, security is setting up overflow areas outside.
Is that The Foo Fighters?
- Foo Fighters.
- Yeah.
Well, it's not "The" Foo Fighters.
Yeah, that is them.
We've actually got nine performers doing sets from 7 to midnight, so...
I love Foo Fighters.
These guys voted, right?
- Josh Lyman.
- Where are you?
I'm in the Grand Ballroom, supervising.
I've been looking for you.
Yeah, I didn't know if you needed some space or...
We just got the first round of exit polls.
- What?
- The exit polls.
They're here.
- Where are the kids?
- School.
It's a Tuesday.
Kind of a big day.
They'll be home by 3.
What do I do here all day?
- You could sleep.
- No, I don't think so.
Come on.
I don't think I can close my eyes.
Then we'll find something else to do.
- What do we got?
- I got you something.
- A gift?
- Whatever.
Markers.
Blue markers.
Check it out.
See for yourself.
Fill it?
North Carolina, we're up by one.
- Up by two in Georgia.
- Georgia?
Look at Louisiana and Virginia.
All over the South we are in it.
The military vote is going for Santos.
All the Republican-value voters are staying home.
We're only up by six in Massachusetts.
Isn't that low?
It's raining.
Ahead by 12 points in New York, seven in New Jersey.
- Even in Texas.
- It's still early.
We're playing in the South?
And Maryland, Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware.
We can put most of the Northeast in our pocket.
Cautious optimism.
Your face is frozen in an odd way.
Unattractively?
Not entirely.
I think my head's gonna explode.
Maybe we should take a walk or something.
Try to de-stress a little before the next numbers come out.
You wanna take a walk or something?
You want some water?
You have a bottle over there?
- Tap water.
- No, thanks.
But thank you.
Mind if I turn on the TV?
See if there's news?
Please.
At least I didn't bring my BlackBerry to bed.
Could be worse.
Less romantic, I mean.
Got it.
President Bartlet and his wife went home to Manchester, New Hampshire last night and visited their local polling place this morning.
- This may sound silly...
- No, what?
I'm worried about the law in Minnesota, prohibiting media and pollsters within 100 feet of polling places.
That's certainly less romantic.
I was looking at the county data earlier.
In Dakota County Republicans have a 16 percent edge in voters but exit polls show us leading.
I wonder if the law's affecting the accuracy of numbers.
Am I just being paranoid?
I'm just being paranoid.
Forget it.
- Hello?
- Hey can you pull all the numbers coming out of Minnesota?
Thanks.
Speedy.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hang on.
- Do you have Donna?
- What?
- Do you have Donna?
- Have her?
- Do you know where she is?
Yeah.
- Is Josh in there?
- Yeah.
Can you tell Donna, Lou needs her to do some spin on MSNBC.
And I have Minnesota numbers for you.
Up one in South Carolina, two in Tennessee.
Ahead in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, only up by one in California.
We gotta keep him moving.
San Diego, Dana Point, Newport Beach, Los Angeles.
- We need to schedule drive time.
- While he's traveling.
Annie?
- Yeah.
- These Minnesota numbers are off.
We should have more of an edge.
Dakota County has Santos leading by eight points.
The youth vote is up, mostly Democratic.
It's throwing off our numbers.
That should taper off as working people vote.
- I shouldn't worry, right?
- You shouldn't.
Superstitious.
One of my Election Day good-luck routines.
- One of?
- You met Carrie already.
Senator Arnold Vinick campaigned through his home state this afternoon hosting events along the coast of Southern California...
Where else has he been today?
Rally in San Diego and Dana Point.
- What did his public schedule say?
- Voting in Santa Paula.
- We should have him in California.
- Little late.
Hundred and fifty thousand square miles in California, 13 million voters.
We can't plant him in a mall and hope he reaches the undecideds.
- That's what Vinick's doing.
- Donna's doing spin and the congressman will hit L.A. With some drive-time radio.
Leo have an impact in Akron?
I heard 17,000 voters didn't budge when the skies opened and dumped buckets of water down on them.
- It's fine, we'll reach those undecideds.
Oh, well, I think we already have.
New exit polls are in.
Illinois South Carolina?
Are you kidding?
Thanks, Edie.
Yeah, I'll let him know.
- So?
- We're up four in Colorado five in Connecticut, three in Illinois, seven in Maryland.
- Pennsylvania, Michigan?
- Both by two.
And we moved ahead in California.
You wanna tell him or should I?
He's asleep.
Really?
Really.
Should we wake him up?
No.
The kids will be here any minute.
Let him sleep.
- Down by three in South Carolina.
- That can't be right.
Down by two in California.
Are you watching this?
We're ahead in North Carolina and South Carolina.
When 's the last time a Democrat played in that region?
I'm not even sure I was born yet...
Has everyone seen these numbers out of Syracuse?
Yeah, the Senator's winning with 53 percent of the vote.
Well, that should be somewhere around 65 percent.
Excuse me, 154 electoral votes if the states were being called right now.
- Including Florida?
- No.
So 181, if we're being optimistic.
Are we being optimistic?
Vermont turnout's down 15 percent.
New Hampshire.
Minnesota...
Something's not right here.
Okay, based on exit polls, I've got 201.
With or without Texas?
- Without.
- We could be at 235?
Nuclear accident came in handy.
We're encouraged by the strong showing in the Midwest, John.
Turnout's up six percent in California alone.
Voters want a change and they know Arnold Vinick can deliver...
- Someone didn't see the poll.
- They call it "spin" for a reason.
- How's that adolescent part feeling now?
- Happier, thanks.
Did you hear some staffers talking about what posters they wanna hang at the White House?
- Who was doing that?
A couple of guys with accents in Advance.
- Minnesota doesn't make sense.
- Don't sweat Dakota County,
As long as we're pounding Vinick in the fourth and fifth districts, we're golden.
- Hey, stranger.
- What's it been, about eight hours?
I saw your briefing.
Apple cider and "lame duck" jokes?
That all you got?
As opposed to watching briefings on C-SPAN and roaming the halls to gossip.
I try to prevent war in East Asia, too, but...
- I apparently get to look for a job.
- In the Santos administration?
- Exit polls are reading that way.
- Do you wanna stay in Communications?
Not sure I wanna stay in the government.
- Consulting work is big, I hear.
- I'm feeling sentimental about California.
- California?
- The local political work.
There's something romantic about it, really.
- Romantic.
- Overseeing a mayoral race in a city that needs a breath of fresh air.
Sounds nice.
I'm gonna...
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Keep me updated on the exit polls.
That's what I said, listen to this:
"With victory assured in Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania Santos should prepare to lend his image to the history books."
- What is that?
- A blog.
It goes on to call him our first Latino president.
- They don't say "candidate"?
- President.
They call it in three states, though the polls don't close for hours.
- Burn in hell.
- They're checking the same data as us.
Posting raw exit poll data without explanation or analysis, it's irresponsible.
Worse for Vinick, they're calling him a loser.
Last thing we want, Democrats thinking they don't need to go to polls because Santos has it in the bag.
- Or Vinick supporters turning out in droves.
- Will you please?
Anybody who's checking out exit polling on a blog voted first thing this morning at 6:45 a.m.
Not if the nets pick them up and report it as news.
Do you think someone's gonna look at "Bernard's Blogland" and mistake it for network news?
It could affect turnout.
How big do you think the readership is?
Four years ago, Bartlet won New Mexico with only 6000 votes.
- Call the networks and...
- Don't, don't, don't!
Anybody see these numbers in New England?
Turnout is down 15 percent in Vermont!
- Josh.
- How are we up in South Carolina and not get people in Vermont?
We got lines in Ohio, we're sending port-a-potties to districts down there so that people don't leave, but the numbers are still low!
We're losing in Maine, a state that Bartlet won with 67 percent of the vote!
The Latino vote in Florida isn't turning out but Rhode Island, they're coming out...
- Josh!
- It's Texas.
Shouldn't it be warm?
- Not in November.
What are you doing out here?
- I've been appointed.
- To what?
- Make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine.
Make sure your head's not actually gonna explode.
- These numbers aren't adding up.
- They never do.
You've been working 18-, 20-hour days for the last year.
- Yeah.
- It's here.
There's nothing to do but let it run its course.
There's nothing left to do, Josh.
In the event that he loses Texas but wins the election we don't wanna get caught with out pants down.
Let me make sure we have this.
They need one if he wins or loses, one if he loses the Latino vote one if he wins the electoral vote, one if he loses the electoral vote and one if he loses his home state.
- Right.
What if two of those things happen?
What if he loses his home state and Latino vote?
- That too.
- What are we talking about?
- The speeches.
- We should have one in case the race is too close to call.
The polls are about to close.
We should get in.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I sort of walked away from you before.
- It got weird all of a sudden.
- Yeah.
Was it something about California?
No, California's a lovely state.
- Doesn't mean I have to move there.
- What?
- If it means we would have to end...
- No, I would never want...
- lf you're planning on staying in D. C...
- I'd never ask you to stay.
You spend the night at my house more often than not.
- Which makes me...?
- A really good date.
I'm not like you.
I don't live and die with the Democratic Party.
I wanna see the next president through this crisis, whoever he is.
You keep saying, "The next president, whoever he is."
Yeah, well, the NSC is a nonpartisan...
Did you vote for Vinick?
You voted for Arnold Vinick?
He hasn't stopped looking at those numbers.
- Hope springs eternal.
Maybe you...
- Yeah.
East Coast polls are closing in a few minutes.
In South Carolina, Santos is up by four.
The African-American population has been oversampled.
They're 34 percent of the interviews and only 29 percent of the voters.
- Bruno...
- In Pennsylvania women are oversampled.
It's wrong.
We're losing North Dakota, a state that's gone Republican for the last 40 years.
- Doesn't give a moment's pause?
- What are you gonna do?
Minnesota, fifth district, the most Democratic district in the state.
Bartlet won it with 71 percent four years ago.
Santos is only pulling in 54 percent.
This isn't over.
- We could be winning...
- You've done a hell of a job.
The nuclear thing, there's no way you could have anticipated that.
In a few seconds, six states will close their polls.
Once all the precincts in those states are closed we'll be able to start bringing you the results of this election.
It has been a long and formidable campaign and it's coming to a close.
We will get you all the information you need to know as quickly as possible.
Right now, we can project that Senator Arnold Vinick will carry Indiana and its 11 electoral votes and Kentucky and its eight electoral votes.
What about Georgia or Vermont or South Carolina or Virginia?
- We get none?
- Be patient.
Set up a line to the DNC Headquarters.
Want a tally of the Congressional races.
I wanna hear about Velasquez.
Leo's gonna sleep through the whole thing.
I gotta get him.
What can I say?
Nerves of steel.
Gotta get him cleaned up for the party.
He's been threatening to wear his robe.
Nothing says victory like threadbare flannel.
Hispanics are favored in six congressional races in Texas and Rhode Island is on its way to electing its first Hispanic congressman.
Something's happening.
We are getting word of a new development.
West Virginia is a state that Democrats had hoped to carry.
We are projecting that this state and its five electoral votes will go to Senator Arnold Vinick.
Historically...
- Hey.
- Hey, you.
- I slept.
- You did.
- And lost West Virginia, apparently.
- And Kentucky and Indiana.
- I'm a loser.
- Oh, 24 to nothing, baby.
But you can still rebound.
I have faith.
- Where are you?
- What?
In your head, where did you go?
I'm just thinking about what I'm gonna do tomorrow.
We'll take the kids to school and then go for breakfast.
Bacon and pancakes.
The backyard needs raking.
If we look closer at a few of these key states, New Jersey, for instance could end up being a disappointment for Vinick if it does indeed swing toward the Democrats.
Santos has been polling here well in the last couple of weeks although the Vinick camp clung to the idea that the security factor could play well to voters in New Jersey.
I'm sure a lot of people are asking why we still have not...
You wanna take those job offers home?
No, thanks.
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Maybe after Christmas.
- Maybe next week.
- Why are we still talking?
- Honestly?
- Yeah.
You're a savvy woman who could easily consider world domination as a next career move.
And I'd like to continue working with you, if that's a possibility.
Right.
You can pack up some of these for me to take home tonight.
Thank you.
On that note, it is exactly 8:07 p.m. On the East Coast.
We are ready to project now that Congressman Matthew Santos will carry the state of Pennsylvania.
- Unbelievable!
- We did it!
- I can't believe it.
- Twenty-one electoral votes.
- Hey.
- I talked to my mother today.
She watches CNN, talks to all her friends and reports to me each of their predictions with equal weight.
All the time, money and energy we spent trying to shake things up what if the electoral map looks like we thought three months ago?
Florida and Ohio go to Vinick.
We take New York, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
- And it all comes down to California.
- The fly-over states and the East Coast.
It happens during every campaign.
You had to make the tough choices.
Something wrong with these numbers.
Vermont, voters swear that they'd vote for a Latino president but the state is splitting 49-49, Santos and Vinick.
We ran a Latino Democrat against a tax-cutting, moderate Republican...
Maine has been trending towards Santos all day but voters are listing security and taxes as the major issues.
What are they lying about?
What they care about or who they're voting for?
We're even playing in Louisiana.
Teddy and Lou are through the roof.
But look at the exit polls.
The data is skewed towards women and African-Americans.
The white men cast their votes after work.
What happens then?
We don't have this wrapped up.
What is the overall sensation here tonight?
That it's going to be very close.
The election will be a very close one.
The campaigns have been planning for it.
We have been planning for it.
It could be a very long night for Matt Santos and Arnold Vinick.
Congratulations, sir.
South Carolina's just been called for you.
He's gonna wanna be up for this.
Mind letting me in?
Leo.
Hello?
Leo?
Leo?
Leo!
Somebody help me!
- Call 911!
- He's down, let's go!
He's down!
He's down!
Requesting ambulance at service entrance, northeast side.

Scotch please, your best.
I need 7 glasses and I'll keep the bottle.
I believe we're really used to spot cowboy hats.
That's rude indoors.
Maybe's a stereotype.
It could be Denver, could be Saint Louis.
- Chicago.
- You bet.
Phoenix, Salt Lake City.
All the time we've spent in all those little cities.
If we accept the fact that this is all coming to an end tomorrow.
Then a single tear slips slowly down your cheek.
Or you can get really hammered.
Everybody needs to relax, except you.
Bartender needs your credit card.
So, let's plan out the future for the rest of our lives.
I want a meal that doesn't consist in Cheetos and a Diet Sprite.
I want a pedicure.
I want a job as a White House speechwriter.
- Don't say that out loud!
- Bad karma, man.
Then the Cheetos did sound good?
I'd sign up for more than 2-hour sleep.
Where were we when the bat was in the hallway in the middle of the night?
When you tried to catch it with a pillowcase?
Portland.
$175 a bottle?
Next time get a pitcher or whatever's on tab.
Next time?
Ok, the Congressman's gonna be wrapping up in LA, who wants to stay sober long enough to get the report from Bram?
Thank you for volunteering, Edie.
I think I'm gonna call it a night.
Oh, so early?
God created few nights in life without midnight rallies, airplane seats and tracking polls.
I'm gonna enjoy one.
Staff meeting 6 a.m. tomorrow.
We'll go over new marching orders then.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You know, I think that's it for me too, so I'll send out an e-mail about LA.
Later.
- Really?
- Apparently.
Should you really be drinking like that?
Like what?
You're 23 years old with a shocking lack of facial hair.
Do you really want to tell a grown woman how to drink?
I didn't think so.
Bedtime.
Go ahead.
You can take the bottle if you want.
Yeah, me too.
See you guys in the morning.
How did I miss that?
You might have had an easier year of it if you'd come on board.
6 o'clock tomorrow morning, right?
Cindy.
Did you know that?
- About Ronna and Cindy?
- Any of them.
- Yes.
- Which one?
All of them.
Did you ever come on board?
No.
Never had a campaign fling?
No.
You want another drink?
No.
Transcript and Synchro GinadeCai
3 a.m.
Did you get any sleep?
A little, you?
Yeah, you don't have to leave.
I know.
I mean you don't have to sneak out.
I wasn't.
I didn't wanna make this awkward, I just did, right?
I was just checking the news sites.
In a sweater?
For warmth.
Why don't I go and get us some coffee?
How are you feeling?
I really wanna win this thing.
Coffee would be great, cream and three sugars.
I already checked AP, nothing new, you should take a look at Reuters.
Scotch, Otto, exercise, you should rehydrate.
I was hoping I could be escaping people for a little while.
Well, the front desk clerk gave you up.
What did he say, little thorg is down on the treadmill, go seek her out?
No, he said he opened the gym for a lady with liquor breath and crazy eyes.
What do you got there?
Vinick made a crack last night about the Congressman's lack of foreign policy experience in Cleveland.
Well, it's hard to effectively fire back at him on Election Day.
There's two and a half hours before the polls open in the East.
...for coming and joining me in Houston on this historic evening, tonight I'm both honored and humbled by the certitude,
No one actually uses the word certitude.
Not really.
You couldn't sleep either?
Final pass of the victory and concession speeches.
It was either this or a solitaire tournament with the Advance guys.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Welcome to the Club!
- No one can sleep.
Evidently.
You seen Reuters?
Vinick suggested the Congressman can't handle the crisis in Kazahstan in some event last night.
A response from the Congressman won't do much of it now ... but we've got Bartlet cabinet members across country doing sattelite spin this morning and they can mention our guy's military experience.
Ok, great.
Tell me you found my pantyhose.
This is it.
Wow, it's less glamurous than I imagined.
We sold the leather couches for our last media buy.
Funny man.
Pretty witty.
Makes me want to ...
I should check the fax.
I already did.
You got nothing better to do at 4 in the morning?
Apparently not.
- Jane Brown, Carrie...
- Marina.
Nice to meet you.
Senator got Santos sarcastics down last night.
Yeah, I saw.
Maybe, too little too late.
- No, it was part of the show.
- Yeah.
When's he landing?
Hour and a half on LAX, then up to Santa Paula to vote.
Bathroom?
- Second door...
- ...to the left.
Thank you.
- It's cute.
- Yeah.
- Little young?
- Yale grad.
Almost grad.
- Couldn't sleep.
- Oh, sure.
God, I hate the waiting.
Say something.
Nothing to say.
Someone should be telling me to change my shirt or not to change the health care section of my stump speech or at least where we're going now.
We're going to the polling place to vote and then home.
Stump speech?
Delivered for the last time.
And we're not running late?
Right on time.
Unbelieveable.
Hey, you look great.
I changed.
I noticed.
Thanks.
Teddy's got the war room up and running?
Yeah.
I didn't wanna be wearing the same clothes as last night.
Right.
How's our 'Get Out The Vote' effort looking?
Great, I hope.
You don't have to worry.
A lot of people are gonna be doing the walk of shame today.
Not that what we did was shameful.
Or is shameful,that's not what I meant.
So,
There's a lot of everything we've talked about, you've got 15.000 volunteers nation wide, knocking on doors, reg and asking for vote into the polls.
Great, where are the surrogates?
Contacted surrogates are doing morning news shows in Ohio, Florida Pennsylvania, Texas and California.
Russell?
Vicepresident is in Colorado today, but he's available for sidelights,
Griffin, Atkins and Baker are all available, they'll pick up a flight when needed, depending what the exit polls say.
Hispanic vote?
Radio spots, targeting largely hispanic counties in California and Florida, and the Congressman will hit Texas this afternoon on the radio.
Right.
We've got it completely handled, Josh.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Really?
Really.
Well, this is it.
Wait begins.
Well, it's about that time for you to do your thing.
My thing?
Thank the troops.
You did realize that you're gonna have do that, right?
Right.
Right.
Hey!
Everyone!
Gather around!
I didn't know most of you before last January and ...
Wow, we've along 11 months.
I hope you've all learned a lot.
I know that I've learned a few things from you, for instance, I didn't know that I would need to explain that we don't do shout-outs during radio interviews, and that we don't encourage our college buddies to hurl expletives at our opponent.
Who was responsible for that thing, anyway?
Who was it?
-¡Dave!
¡Dave!
¡Dave!
- Dave, take a bow!
You fired him.
Well, wherever you are, thanks for the lesson.
It's ... a special day.
A high point in your young impressionable lives.
So go.
Take a few minutes to enjoy it.
And then, call your family and friends, make sure they vote it.
Actually, ask them about the lines at their polling precints, so we know if our 'Get Out The Vote' is working.
They can report any harassment, anything weird, or if it's snowing, whatever.
They can tell you that.
I'm serious.
Call them.
Good group.
You might wanna work the phrase 'thank you' in there somewhere.
Thank you, I appreciate it.
O key-dokey.
Polls open in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Senator Arnold Vinick's campaign made this final stop in a election season this morning here in Santa Paula, California....
Senator Vinick returned to his hometown...
Come in.
Breakfast.
Are we going steady?
You called me.
The speeches.
You approved them already.
One if we win, one if we lose.
I think we may need another one.
Isn't it pretty black and white?
We've put a lot of emphasis on the Congressman being the first Hispanic candidate.
We may need one in case he doesn't sweep the Hispanic vote.
Ok.
- You know, be prepared?
- Great.
Are you waiting for a hug or something?
Thank you.
California, Nevada, Washington and Idaho.
Polls are now open everywhere, people.
Alaska and Hawaii aren't open yet.
The two states on which the outcome of the presidential race so often depends.
Idaho was ever the linchpin.
And Senator's voting there and meeting his daughter for breakfast.
Is it too early to order the lunch?
Stan came up an hour ago.
I'm starving.
How's the Hispanic turnout in Florida?
Governor spent out all morning, we've got 10.000 volunteers in Jacksonville,
Orlando, Tampa and Miami.
And 'Get Out the Vote'?
Hey, they switched this.
As we go live to Houston, Texas...
It's morning in Texas already.
We missed the only morning cover in the East.
Yeah, but they cut it into our California coverage perfectly.
After hosting a rally in Los Angeles...
They all switched from Vinick to Santos.
Lou's a genious.
How was last night?
I changed the health care portion of the stump again, but... otherwise, 45.000 screaming devotees, kind of cold-like.
How's he today?
Sort of relaxed.
- You're kidding?
- No.
It's kinda weird calm.
We're hanging back to the house, after this.
How long to the first exit polls?
A couple of hours.
Can't tell you how bad that is.
4 rallies in 4 states. 4 buses, 3 flights...
Hold on.
We need turnout in Boston.
Huge turnout.
Vinick's gonna win Western Massachusets, he's probably gonna take Cape Cod.
We need to run up the score in Boston.
- Yeah.
- It's raining.
Yeah, well, she beat you to the punch.
Though we're already monitoring weather conditions and traffic patterns,
Massachusets field ops called, says they're distributing umbrellas for volunteers and escorting voters from their cars to the polling places.
- We could use some aditional...
- Drive time?
Absolutely.
Scheduled for 3:00.
National Weather Service says there's another high pressure system shower should linger over the Berkshires, ...slowing down any Vinick supporters still getting out there to the polls.
Now, we're getting new weather models every half hour.
You wanna see them?
No, we're fine.
We don't need them.
Thanks.
Josh, we are completely and totally under control.
We've been planning this for 5 months.
This is Teddie.
-You know what?
- What?
- On the elevator today...
- Yeah?
I was talking to a man who didn't even know it was Election Day.
Jeremy?
Ride the elevator for a few hours.
Anyone from Houston, remind him to vote.
I was thinking this morning I wish we should do an additional speech.
- One in the event...
- Hispanic vote draft, you wanna take a look?
It's different from the electoral college vote, another if...
No, I got you.
What you want it's 2 speeches.
One if we win the electoral and lose the popular, and the other if viceversa happens, yeah?
- Yeah.
- 2 more.
- 2 more.
Do 2.
- Do 2.
You're right.
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Drew.
What are you doing in...?
You know...
Bram wants me to make sure that everything is going smoothly for the party tonight.
They're about to start doing some soundtracks in the ballroom.
Go.
- You mind if I come along... with you?
Sorry.
If you are heading towards my office with those, you should rethink your course.
- Illustrious job offers.
- Post me about the election.
No word on the exit polls.
I just checked with Will.
Fine.
Margaret's been setting a meeting with potential future employers,
I took it upon myself to do some research.
She's supposed to scheduled them in January.
See, always busy people.
They scheduled the January meetings in November.
Board directors at Johnson Johnson, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, SBC, personal, corporate and human resources at GE,
Kennedy's school's looking for a new D,
Everyone wants you.
Do you really think today is the day for this?
One has offices in Prague, though you have to be fluent in Czech.
Another one, a company jet.
Not Air Force One, but not bad.
A lot of them have great stock options, something you should look into.
Suckers could be worth something someday.
3.000 people have been invited.
30.000 are gonna try to make it through the door.
Well, Security's setting up overflow areas outside.
Is that the Floo Fighters?
Foo Fighters.
- Yeah.
- It's not The Floo Fighters.
Yeah, that is them.
We've got 9 performers doing sets from 7 to midnight, so.
I love...
Foo Fighters.
These guys voted, right?
Josh Lyman.
Where are you?
In the Grand Ballroom, supervising.
I'm looking for you.
Yeah, I don't know if you needed some space, or...
Come upstairs, we've just got the first round of exit polls.
- What?
- The exit polls.
They're here.
Where are the kids?
School.
It's a Tuesday.
It's kind of a big day.
They'll be home by 3:00.
What do I do here the whole day?
- You can sleep...
- No, I don't think so.
Come on.
I don't think I can close my eyes.
We'll find something else to do.
What do we got?
I got you something.
- Gift?
- Whatever.
Mark...
Blue markers!
Check it out.
See it for yourself.
Really?
North Carolina, we're up by 1.
Up by 2 in Georgia.
Look at Louisiana and Virginia.
All over the South.
We are in it.
Military voters going for Santos.
Or the Republican value voters are staying home.
We're only up by 6 in Massachusettes?
Isn't that a little low?
It's raining.
Ahead by 12 points in New York, 7 in New Jersey.
- Dead even in Texas.
- It's still early.
Are we really playing in the South?
Maryland, Vermont, Conneticut, Delaware,
I think we can put most of the Northeast in our pocket.
Hey!
Cautious optimism.
Your face is frozen in an odd way.
Unattractively?
Not entirely.
I think my head's gonna explode.
Maybe you should...
take a walk or something.
Try to de-stress a little, before the next numbers come out.
You wanna take a walk?
or...something?
You want some water?
You have a bottle over there?
- Tap water.
- No, thanks.
But thank you.
Do you mind if I turn on the TV and see if there's any news?
Please.
At least I didn't bring my Blackberry to bed.
It could be worse.
Less romantic.
Got it.
President Bartlet and his wife flew to their home in Manchester, NH, last night, and went to their local polling place first thing this morning.
- This may sound silly.
- No, what?
I'm worried about that new law in Minnesota prohibiting media and pollsters within 100 feet of polling places.
That's certainly less romantic.
I was looking at some of the county data earlier in Dakota county,
Republicans have a 16% edge in registered voters, but the exit polls show us leading by 8%.
I wonder if the law is affecting the accuracy of the numbers we're getting.
Or am I just being paranoid.
I'm just ...
being paranoid.
Forget it.
- Hello?
- Hey!
Can you pull out the numbers coming out of Minnesota?
Thanks.
Speedy...
- Hello!
- Hello!
Hang on!
Do you have Donna?
What?
Do you have Donna?
Have her?
Do you know where she is?
Yeah.
- Is Josh in there?
- Yeah.
Can you tell Donna Lou needs her to do some spin on MSNBC?
And I have Minnesota numbers for you.
Up 1 in South Carolina, 2 in Tennessee.
So are all the odd in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, but only up by 1 in California.
We got to keep him moving today.
San Diego, Dana Point, Newport Beach, Los Angeles, and we need to schedule some drivetime.
The twin stops while he's travelling, Annie.
This Minnesota numbers are rough.
We should have more finance on showing gap at the exit polls.
Dakota county has Santos leading by 8 points.
The youth voters are 14% across the state, mostly going democratic, it's ... our numbers.
Yeah, but that should stay for all.
This working people vote on their way home.
I shouldn't worry, right?
You shouldn't.
Superstitious.
One of my Election Day good luck routines.
One of?
You met Carrie already.
Senator Arnold Vinick continued campaigning through his homestate this afternoon.
Hosting events in towns along the coast of Southern California...
Hosting events, right?
Rally in San Diego, and Dana Point.
What's his public schedule say for today?
Voting and breakfast in Santa Paula.
We should have the Congressman in California.
A little late in the game for that.
150.000 square miles in the State of California, 30 million voters.
They can't exactly plan to move all with a megaphone and hope to reach out some undecided.
That's what Vinick's doing!
is already doing it, is better than networks, ...and the Congressman is scheduled to hit LA in the big areas, some drivetime radio.
Leo have an impact in Akron?
Nearly 17.000 of our voters didn't budge when the skies open up and started dumping buckets of water on them.
Everything's fine, Josh.
We'll reach those undecideds.
Oh, well, I think ... we already have.
New exit polls are in.
In Illinois?
South Carolina?
Are you kidding?
All right.
Thanks, Eddie.
Yeah, I'll let him know.
So?
We're up 4 in Colorado, 5 in Connecticut, 3 in Illinois, 7 in Maryland.
Pennsylvania, Michigan?
Up both by 2.
And we've moved ahead in California.
Do you wanna tell him or should I?
He's asleep.
Really?
Really.
Should we wake him up?
No, the kids will be here any minute.
Let him sleep.
Down by 3 in South Carolina.
That can't be right.
Down by 2 in California.
Are you watching this?
We're ahead in North Carolina and South Carolina.
When was the last time that a Democrat played in that region?
Someone has seen the numbers out of Syracuse?
Yeah, the Senator's winning...
with 53% of the vote.
That should be somewhere around 65%, excuse me.
154 electoral votes of the states are in call right now.
Including Florida?
No.
So, 181 for being optimist.
Are we being optimistic?
Vermont turnout stands 50%, New Hampshire, Minnesota... something's not right here.
Ok, based on exit polls, I've got 201.
With or without Texas?
Without.
We could be at 235.
Nuclear accident came in handy.
We're encouraged by the numbers showing in the Midwest and West.
Turnout's up 6% in California alone.
I think voters wanted to change and they know Arnold Vinick.
Someone didn't see the exit polls.
They call it 'spin' for a reason.
Hey, how's that adolescent part of you feeling now?
Happier, thanks.
Did you hear some of the junior staffers talking about what kind of posters they wanna hang up on their White House Walls?
Who is doing that?
A couple of guys with accent in Advance.
This Minnesota numbers still don't make sense.
Don't sweat Dakota county.
As long as we're pounding Vinick in the 4th and 5th districts, we're good.
Hey, stranger!
What's it been?
8 hours?
Saw your briefing this morning.
Apple cider and lame duck jokes, that all you got?
As opposed to you, whose day seems to include watching briefings on C-SPAN and roaming the halls to gossip about them.
I try to prevent war in East Asia, too.
I have to start looking for a job.
In the Santos Administration?
Exit polls are reading towards that so far.
Would you wanna stay on communications?
I'm not sure if I wanna stay with federal government.
Consulting work is paid in here.
I'm actually feeling a little sentimental about California.
California?
Local political work.
There's something romantic about it, really.
'Romantic'
Over seeing a major role race ...in the city that needs a breath of fresh air.
Sounds nice.
I'm gonna...
You're ok?
Yeah, fine.
Keep me updated on the exit polls.
It's what I said.
Hey, listen to this:
With victory assured in Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania, ...Matthew Santos should be preparing to lend his image to the History books.
- Who's that?
- A blog, it goes on to call him Our First Latino President.
- Doesn't say candidate?
- President.
Good photo.
I saw the Con in 3 states, even the polls don't close in the West for 4 more hours.
He should burn in hell.
They're just checking out the same data we are.
Posting raw exit poll data... without any explanation or analysis is irresponsible and dangerous.
It's worse for Vinick.
They're already calling him a loser.
Last thing we want.
Democrats in Oregon and California think they don't need to go to the polls because Santos already has in the bag.
Yeah, while Vinick's supporters turn it out and drawl to some last ditch resource.
Will you, please?
Anybody who's checking out exit polls on a blog voted first thing this morning at 6:45 a.m.
Not if the nets pick them up and report them as news.
Which they're not gonna do.
Do you really think people are going to look at...
Bernard's Blogland and mistake what they see for network news?
I think you can afect turnout, yes.
How big do you think the readership of Bernard's Blogland is?
4 years ago, Bartlet won New Mexico with only 6.000 votes.
Call the networks...
Don't, don't, don't!
Is anybody else seeing these numbers coming out of New England?
Turnout is down 15% in Vermont?
Josh!
How can we be up in South Carolina and not get people to the polls in Vermont?
We got long lines in Ohio.
We're sending Porta Potties to Democratic districts down there so that people don't leave, but the numbers are still low!
We're losing in Maine?
A state that Bartlet won with 67% of the vote?
The Latino vote in Florida isn't turning out, but in Rhode Island they're coming out of the woodwork!
Josh!
It's Texas.
Shouldn't it be warm?
Not in November.
What are you doing out here?
I've been appointed.
To what.
Make sure you're okay.
I'm fine.
Make sure your head's not actually going to expode.
These numbers aren't adding up.
They never do.
You've been working 18 ... 20 hour days for the last year.
Yeah.
It's here.
There's nothing to do but let it run its course.
There's nothing left to do, Josh.
In the advance that he loses Texas, but wins the election, we don't wanna get caught with our pants down.
Ok, so, let me make sure we have this.
We need one if he wins, one if he loses.
One if he loses the Latino vote.
One if he wins the electoral vote but loses the popular vote.
One if he loses the electoral vote but wins the popular vote.
And one if he loses his home state.
Right.
What if two of these things happen simultaneously?
And what if he loses his home state and the Latino vote and still wins?
- That too, then.
- What are we talking about?
The speeches.
Yeah, we should have one in case it's too close to call.
Polls are about to close in the East Coast.
We should get in there.
- Hey!
- Hey!
I sort of walked away from you before.
- It got weird all of a sudden.
- Yeah.
Was it something about California?
No.
California is a lovely state.
Doesn't mean I have to move there.
¿What?
It means you and I would have to end...
No, God, no.
- If you're planning on stay...
- I would never ask you...
- I could stay.
- To stay with me.
You spend the night at my house more often than not.
Which makes me...
A really good date?
I'm not like you.
I don't live and die with the Democratic Party.
I want to see the next president through this crisis in Kazahstan, whoever he is.
You keep saying that.
The next president, whoever he is...
- Yeah, well, the NSC's a non-partisan...
- Did you vote for Vinick?
You voted for Arnold Vinick?
He's been looking at those numbers for 3 hours.
I know, hopes spring eternal.
- Maybe you would...
- Yeah.
East Coast polls are closing in a few minutes.
In South Carolina Santos is up by 4.
The African American population has been oversampled.
They represent 34% of the interviews in only 29% of the voters.
Bruno.
In Pennsylvania women are oversampled.
The numbers are wrong.
We're also losing in North Dakota, a state which has gone Republican for the last 40 years.
Santos doesn't give you a moment of pause.
What are you gonna do after this?
Minnessota, 5th district, the most Democratic district in the state,
Bartlet won it with 71% 4 years ago,
Santos is only polling in 54%.
- We could be winning this thing.
- You've done a hell of a job here.
The nuclear thing, there was no way you could have anticipated that.
In a few seconds, 6 states will close their polls, ... once all the precintcs in those states are closed, ... we'll be able to start ringing you the results of this election.
It has been a long and formidable campaign, and it's all coming to a close.
We will get you all the information you need to know as quickly as possible.
Right now we can project it.
Senator Arnold Vinick will carry Indiana and its 11 electoral votes and Kentucky and its 8 electoral votes.
What about Georgia or Vermont or South Carolina or Virginia?
We get none?
Be patient.
Eddie, set up a line to the DNC headquarters.
We're gonna want live on the congressional races.
- I wanna hear about the last race.
- That'll be something.
Leo's gonna sleep through the whole damn thing.
I've gotta go get him up.
What can I say?
Nerves of steel.
Just gotta get him cleaned up for the party.
He's been threatening to wear his robe.
Oh!
Nothing says victory like threadbare flannel.
Hispanic candidates are favorite... in 6 congressional races in Texas and Rhode Island,
Roswell is on its way to electing the first Hispanic Congressman.
Something's happening.
We are just getting word now of a new development here.
West Virginia, is a state that Democrats have hoped to carry.
We are projecting though that this state and its 5 electoral votes, will go to Senator Arnold Vinick.
Hey!
Hey you.
- I slept!
- You did!
And lost West Virginia, apparently.
And Kentucky and Indiana.
- I'm a loser.
- Oh, don't you worry about nothing, baby.
But you can still rebound.
I have faith.
Where are you?
What?
In your head, where did you go?
Just thinking about what I'm gonna do tomorrow.
We'll take the kids to school, then go out to breakfast: bacon and pancakes.
Backyard needs raking.
If we look a little closer at a few of these key states,
New Jersey, for instance, who'd end up being a dissapointment for the Vinick campaign, if it does indeed swing towards the Democrats.
Santos is been polling here very well for the last couple of weeks... although, the Vinick can ploung to the idea that the security factor... can play well for the voters in New Jersey.
I'm sure a lot of people are asking right now why still that numbers...
You wanna take some of those job offers home with you?
No, thanks.
Maybe we'll look again tomorrow.
Maybe after Christmas.
Maybe next week.
Why are we still talking about this?
- Honestly?
- Yeah.
You're a smart and savvy woman who could easily consider world domination as her next career move.
And I'd like to continue working with you, if that's a possibility.
Right.
You can pack some of these for me to take home tonight.
Thank you.
It is exactly 8:07 p.m. on the East Coast, we are ready to project now... that Congressman Matthew Santos will carry the state of Penssylvania.
Hey.
I talked to my mother today.
She watches CNN, talks to all her friends and reports to me each of their predictions with equal weight.
All the time, money and energy we ...
spent trying to shake things up... what if the Electoral Map looks exactly like we thought it would 3 months ago?
Florida and Ohio go to Vinick, we take New York, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Then it all comes down to California.
Flyover states and the East Coast.
It happens during every campaign, Josh.
You had to make the tough choices
There's been something wrong with these numbers all day.
Vermont voters swear that they would vote for a Latino president, ...but the state is splitting 49-49 Santos and Vinick.
We ran a Latino Democrat against a tax-cutting, moderate Republican.
There's going to...
Maine has been trending towards Santos all day, ... but voters are listing security... and taxes as their major issues.
So...what are they lying about?
What they care about?
Or who they're voting for?
We're even playing in Louisiana.
Teddy and Lou are through the roof!
But look at the exit polls.
The data is skewed towards women and African-Americans.
The white men cast their votes after work.
What happens then?
We don't have this wrapped up.
What is the overall sensation here tonight?
That is going to be very close.
The election will be a very close one.
The campaigns have been planning for it, we have been planning for it too.
It could be a very long night for Matt Santos and Arnold Vinick.
Congratulations, sir.
South Carolina has just been called for you.
I'm betting he's gonna want to be up for this.
Mind letting me in?
Leo!
Helloooo!
Leo!
Leo?
Leo?
Somebody help me!
Call 911!

Previously on The West Wing:
Santos could take a vacation and just let the press keep hammering me on this nuclear thing.
Ohio trends Santos!
That's the story of the day.
The voters set the terms of the elections, not us.
They get to decide what's important, not us.
If I win California, I win the country.
We need to be prepared for a court battle.
- You think we're gonna win?
- I do.
The real decision the American people have to make is who do they want as their next commander in chief.
- We're tied.
- Holy mother of God, we caught him!
- Yes!
- We caught him!
Scotch, please.
Your best.
I need seven glasses.
And I'll keep the bottle.
I'd believe we were in Houston if I saw more cowboy hats.
- It's rude indoors.
- Maybe it's a stereotype.
- It could be Denver.
Could be St. Louis.
- Chicago.
Phoenix, Salt Lake City.
All that time we spent there.
You have to accept the fact that this is all coming to an end tomorrow.
And a single tear slips slowly down your cheek.
Or you can get really hammered.
Everybody needs to relax.
Except you.
The bartender needs your credit card.
So who's planned for the rest of their lives?
I want a meal that isn't Cheetos and a Diet Sprite.
- I want a pedicure.
- I wanna be a White House speechwriter.
- Don't say that out loud.
- Bad karma, man.
- Then Cheetos sounds good.
- I'd settle for more than two hours' sleep.
- Where was the bat loose in the hall?
- That you caught with a pillowcase?
- That one.
- Portland.
A hundred and seventy-five dollars a bottle?
Next time, get a pitcher of whatever's on tap.
Next time?
The congressman will be wrapping up in L.A.
Who wants to stay sober long enough to get the report from Bram?
Thanks for volunteering, Edie.
- Think I'm gonna call it a night.
- So early?
God created few nights in life without midnight rallies airplane seats and tracking polls.
I'm gonna enjoy one.
Staff meeting, 6 a.m. Tomorrow.
We'll go over new marching orders then.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You know, I think that's it for me too.
So I'll send out an e-mail about L.A. later.
- Really?
- Apparently.
- Should you be drinking like that?
- Like what?
You're 23 years old with a shocking lack of facial hair.
Do you really wanna tell a grown woman how to drink?
I didn't think so.
Bedtime.
You can take the bottle if you want.
Yeah me too.
See you guys in the morning.
- How did I miss that?
- You might've had an easier year of it if you had come onboard.
- Six o'clock tomorrow morning, right?
- Yeah.
Wow, Cindy?
- Did you know that?
- About Ronna and Cindy?
- Any of them.
- Yes.
- Which one?
- All of them.
Did you ever come onboard?
No.
Never had a campaign fling?
No.
Do you want another drink?
No.
- It's 3 a.m.
- Yeah.
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little.
You?
Yeah.
- You don't have to leave.
- I know.
- I mean, you don't have to sneak out.
- I wasn't.
I didn't wanna make this awkward, but I just did.
I was just checking the news sites.
- And the sweater?
- For warmth.
Why don't I go get us some coffee?
- How are you feeling?
- I really wanna win this thing.
- Coffee would be great.
Cream and...
- Three sugars.
I already checked AP.
Nothing new.
You should take a look at Reuters.
Scotch, Otto, exercise.
You should rehydrate.
I was hoping to escape you for a little while.
Well, the front-desk clerk gave you up.
He say, "Lou's on the treadmill, go seek her out"?
He said he opened the gym for a lady with liquor breath and crazy eyes.
- What do you got there?
- Vinick made a crack last night about the congressman's lack of foreign-policy experience.
Well, it's hard to effectively fire back at him on Election Day.
Only two and a half hours before the polls open in the East.
Yeah.
"Thank you all for joining me in Houston on this historic evening.
Tonight, I'm both honored and humbled by the certitude..."
Hey, no one actually uses the word "certitude."
Not really.
You couldn't sleep either?
Final pass at the victory and concession speeches.
It was either this or a solitaire tournament with the Advance guys.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Welcome to the club.
- No one can sleep.
- Evidently.
- You see Reuters?
Vinick said the congressman couldn't handle the Kazakhstan crisis last night.
Well, a response won't do much good now but we've got Bartlet cabinet members doing satellite spin.
They can mention our guy's military experience.
- All right, great.
- Would you check on this for me?
Thanks.
Tell me you found my pantyhose.
Thank you.
- This is it.
- It's less glamorous than I imagined.
We sold the leather couches for our last media buy.
Funny man.
Pretty witty.
Makes me want to...
- I should check the fax.
- I already did.
You got nothing better to do at 4 in the morning?
Apparently not.
- Jane Braun, Carrie...?
- Marino.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- Senator hit Santos on Kazakhstan.
- Yeah, I saw.
- It may be too little, too late.
- Well, it was worth a shot.
- When's he landing?
- An hour and a half at LAX then up to Santa Paula to vote.
- Yeah.
Bathroom?
- Oh, it's...
left.
- Oh, second door on your left.
Thank you.
- She's cute.
- Yeah.
- Little young.
- Yale grad.
Almost grad.
- Couldn't sleep.
- Oh, sure.
God, I hate the waiting.
- Say something.
- Nothing to say.
Someone should tell me to change my shirt or not to change the health-care section of the speech or where we're going next.
- We're going to vote and then home.
- The stump speech?
- Delivered for the last time.
- And we're not running late?
- Right on time.
Unbelievable.
- Hey, you look great.
- I changed.
- Yeah, I noticed.
- Thanks.
- Teddy's got the war room running?
- Yeah.
I didn't want to be wearing the same clothes as last night.
How's our Get Out the Vote effort looking?
Great, I hope.
You don't have to worry.
A lot of people are gonna be doing the walk of shame today.
Not that what we did was shameful.
Or is shameful.
That's not what I meant.
- So...
- Here's everything we talked about.
250,000 volunteers nationwide knocking on doors, escorting voters to the polls.
- Where are the surrogates?
- We've got surrogates doing news in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and California.
- Russell?
- He's in Colorado today but he's available for satellites.
Griffith, Atkins and Baker are available to fly wherever we need them depending on the polls.
- Hispanic vote?
Radio spots targeting largely Hispanic counties in California and Florida.
The congressman will hit Texas today with some drive-time radio.
- Right.
- We got it completely handled, Josh.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Really?
- Really.
This is it.
The wait begins.
Well, it's about time for you to do your thing.
- My thing?
- Thank the troops.
You did realize you were gonna have to do that.
Right, right.
Hey, everyone.
Gather round.
I didn't know most of you before last January, and...
Wow, it's been a long 11 months.
I hope you've all learned a lot.
I know that I learned a few things from you.
For instance, I didn't know that I would need to explain that we don't do shout-outs during radio interviews.
And we don't encourage college buddies to hurl expletives at our opponent.
Who was responsible for that thing in Dubuque, anyway?
Who was it?
- Dave.
- Dave.
Dave, Dave.
Take a bow.
You fired him.
Well, wherever you are, thanks for the lesson.
It's a special day.
A high point in your young, impressionable lives.
So go, take a few minutes to enjoy it.
And then call your family and friends.
Make sure they voted.
Ask about the lines at their precincts so we know if Get Out the Vote works.
They can report any harassment, anything weird.
Or if it's snowing, whatever.
They can tell you that.
I'm serious.
Call them.
- Good group.
- Yeah.
You might wanna work the phrase "thank you" in there.
- Thank you.
Appreciate it.
- Okey-dokey.
Polls open in five, four, three two, one.
Senator Arnold Vinick's campaign made its final stop of the election season here in Santa Paula, California.
Senator Vinick returns to his hometown with a different goal...
Come in.
- Breakfast.
- Are we going steady?
- You called me.
- The speeches.
You approved them.
One if we win, one if we lose.
- We might need another one.
- Isn't it black and white?
We placed a lot of emphasis on him being the first Hispanic candidate.
We need one in case he doesn't sweep the Hispanic vote.
- Okay.
- You know, be prepared.
Great.
Are you waiting for a hug or something?
- Isn't going to go down without a fight.
Thank you.
California, Nevada, Washington, Idaho.
Polls are now open everywhere.
Alaska and Hawaii aren't open yet.
Two states on which the outcome of the race so often depends.
Like Idaho was ever the linchpin.
Senator's voting, then meeting his daughter for breakfast.
- Anybody ready to order lunch?
- The sun came up an hour ago.
I'm starving.
The Hispanic turnout in Florida?
Swenson's been out all morning.
We got 10,000 volunteers in Jacksonville, Orlando and Miami.
- And Get Out the Vote is...?
- What's this?
He's just voting now?
- We now go live to Houston.
- It's 9 a.m. In Texas.
He missed morning coverage in the East.
Yeah, but he cut into our California coverage perfectly.
After hosting a rally in Los Angeles...
- They'll switch from Vinick to Santos.
- Lou's a genius.
How was last night?
He changed the health-care portion of the stump again but otherwise, 45,000 screaming devotees.
Kind of cult-like.
How is he today?
- He's relaxed.
- You're kidding?
No, it's kind of weird, calm.
We're heading back to the house.
- How long to the first exit polls?
- Couple of hours.
I can 't tell you how badly I need a shower.
Four rallies in four states, four buses, three flights.
- You can probably smell me...
- Hold on.
Boston!
We need turnout in Boston, huge turnout.
Vinick will win western Massachusetts.
He's gonna take Cape Cod.
Need to up the score in Boston.
- Yeah.
- It's raining.
Yeah, well, she beat you to the punch.
Though we were already monitoring road conditions and traffic patterns.
The Massachusetts field ops called, said they are distributing umbrellas so volunteers can escort voters from cars to polling places.
- Should we do some additional...
- Drive-time?
Scheduled for 3:00.
The National Weather Service said there's a high-pressure system coming.
It should stop the rain by 2:00.
Good news is, showers should linger over the Berkshires slowing down any Vinick supporters still getting to the polls.
We're getting new weather models every half hour.
- You wanna see them?
- No, we're fine.
Don't need it.
Josh, we are completely and totally under control.
We've been planning this for five months.
You know what?
I was in the elevator today.
I was talking to a man who didn't even know it was Election Day.
Jeremy, ride the elevator for a few hours.
Anyone from Houston, remind them to vote.
I was thinking, we should do an additional speech.
- One in the event...
- Hispanic vote draft.
Wanna take a look?
- The popular vote is different from the Electoral College vote.
Another if...
I got you.
You want two speeches.
One if we win the electoral and lose the popular and the vice versa.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
Two more?
- Two more.
Do two.
You're right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Drew.
What are you doing right now?
Bram asked me to make sure everything's going smoothly for the party tonight.
- They're about to do sound checks.
- Cool.
You mind if I come along with you?
Sure.
If you're heading toward my office, you should rethink that.
- Job offers.
- Talk to me about the election.
- No word yet on the exit polls.
- Fine.
Margaret's been setting up meetings with employers.
I took it upon myself to do research.
She's supposed to schedule them in January.
CEOs are busy.
They schedule January meetings in November.
Board of Directors at Johnson Johnson Lockheed Martin, Boeing, SBC.
President of Human Resources at GE.
Kennedy School needs a new dean.
Everyone wants you.
- Is today the day for this?
- One has offices in Prague but you have to be fluent in Czech.
Another, a company jet.
Not Air Force One, but not bad.
A lot have stock options, something you should look into.
Suckers could be worth something someday.
Three thousand people have been invited.
Thirty thousand are gonna try to make it through the door.
Well, security is setting up overflow areas outside.
Is that The Foo Fighters?
- Foo Fighters.
- Yeah.
Well, it's not "The" Foo Fighters.
Yeah, that is them.
We've actually got nine performers doing sets from 7 to midnight, so...
I love Foo Fighters.
These guys voted, right?
- Josh Lyman.
- Where are you?
I'm in the Grand Ballroom, supervising.
I've been looking for you.
Yeah, I didn't know if you needed some space or...
We just got the first round of exit polls.
- What?
- The exit polls.
They're here.
- Where are the kids?
- School.
It's a Tuesday.
Kind of a big day.
They'll be home by 3.
What do I do here all day?
- You could sleep.
- No, I don't think so.
Come on.
I don't think I can close my eyes.
Then we'll find something else to do.
- What do we got?
- I got you something.
- A gift?
- Whatever.
Markers.
Blue markers.
Check it out.
See for yourself.
Fill it?
North Carolina, we're up by one.
- Up by two in Georgia.
- Georgia?
Look at Louisiana and Virginia.
All over the South we are in it.
The military vote is going for Santos.
All the Republican-value voters are staying home.
We're only up by six in Massachusetts.
Isn't that low?
It's raining.
Ahead by 12 points in New York, seven in New Jersey.
- Even in Texas.
- It's still early.
We're playing in the South?
And Maryland, Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware.
We can put most of the Northeast in our pocket.
Cautious optimism.
Your face is frozen in an odd way.
Unattractively?
Not entirely.
I think my head's gonna explode.
Maybe we should take a walk or something.
Try to de-stress a little before the next numbers come out.
You wanna take a walk or something?
You want some water?
You have a bottle over there?
- Tap water.
- No, thanks.
But thank you.
Mind if I turn on the TV?
See if there's news?
Please.
At least I didn't bring my BlackBerry to bed.
Could be worse.
Less romantic, I mean.
Got it.
President Bartlet and his wife went home to Manchester, New Hampshire last night and visited their local polling place this morning.
- This may sound silly...
- No, what?
I'm worried about the law in Minnesota, prohibiting media and pollsters within 100 feet of polling places.
That's certainly less romantic.
I was looking at the county data earlier.
In Dakota County Republicans have a 16 percent edge in voters but exit polls show us leading.
I wonder if the law's affecting the accuracy of numbers.
Am I just being paranoid?
I'm just being paranoid.
Forget it.
- Hello?
- Hey can you pull all the numbers coming out of Minnesota?
Thanks.
Speedy.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hang on.
- Do you have Donna?
- What?
- Do you have Donna?
- Have her?
- Do you know where she is?
Yeah.
- Is Josh in there?
- Yeah.
Can you tell Donna, Lou needs her to do some spin on MSNBC.
And I have Minnesota numbers for you.
Up one in South Carolina, two in Tennessee.
Ahead in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, only up by one in California.
We gotta keep him moving.
San Diego, Dana Point, Newport Beach, Los Angeles.
- We need to schedule drive time.
- While he's traveling.
Annie?
- Yeah.
- These Minnesota numbers are off.
We should have more of an edge.
Dakota County has Santos leading by eight points.
The youth vote is up, mostly Democratic.
It's throwing off our numbers.
That should taper off as working people vote.
- I shouldn't worry, right?
- You shouldn't.
Superstitious.
One of my Election Day good-luck routines.
- One of?
- You met Carrie already.
Senator Arnold Vinick campaigned through his home state this afternoon hosting events along the coast of Southern California...
Where else has he been today?
Rally in San Diego and Dana Point.
- What did his public schedule say?
- Voting in Santa Paula.
- We should have him in California.
- Little late.
Hundred and fifty thousand square miles in California, 13 million voters.
We can't plant him in a mall and hope he reaches the undecideds.
- That's what Vinick's doing.
- Donna's doing spin and the congressman will hit L.A. With some drive-time radio.
Leo have an impact in Akron?
I heard 17,000 voters didn't budge when the skies opened and dumped buckets of water down on them.
- It's fine, we'll reach those undecideds.
Oh, well, I think we already have.
New exit polls are in.
Illinois South Carolina?
Are you kidding?
Thanks, Edie.
Yeah, I'll let him know.
- So?
- We're up four in Colorado five in Connecticut, three in Illinois, seven in Maryland.
- Pennsylvania, Michigan?
- Both by two.
And we moved ahead in California.
You wanna tell him or should I?
He's asleep.
Really?
Really.
Should we wake him up?
No.
The kids will be here any minute.
Let him sleep.
- Down by three in South Carolina.
- That can't be right.
Down by two in California.
Are you watching this?
We're ahead in North Carolina and South Carolina.
When 's the last time a Democrat played in that region?
I'm not even sure I was born yet...
Has everyone seen these numbers out of Syracuse?
Yeah, the Senator's winning with 53 percent of the vote.
Well, that should be somewhere around 65 percent.
Excuse me, 154 electoral votes if the states were being called right now.
- Including Florida?
- No.
So 181, if we're being optimistic.
Are we being optimistic?
Vermont turnout's down 15 percent.
New Hampshire.
Minnesota...
Something's not right here.
Okay, based on exit polls, I've got 201.
With or without Texas?
- Without.
- We could be at 235?
Nuclear accident came in handy.
We're encouraged by the strong showing in the Midwest, John.
Turnout's up six percent in California alone.
Voters want a change and they know Arnold Vinick can deliver...
- Someone didn't see the poll.
- They call it "spin" for a reason.
- How's that adolescent part feeling now?
- Happier, thanks.
Did you hear some staffers talking about what posters they wanna hang at the White House?
- Who was doing that?
A couple of guys with accents in Advance.
- Minnesota doesn't make sense.
- Don't sweat Dakota County,
As long as we're pounding Vinick in the fourth and fifth districts, we're golden.
- Hey, stranger.
- What's it been, about eight hours?
I saw your briefing.
Apple cider and "lame duck" jokes?
That all you got?
As opposed to watching briefings on C-SPAN and roaming the halls to gossip.
I try to prevent war in East Asia, too, but...
- I apparently get to look for a job.
- In the Santos administration?
- Exit polls are reading that way.
- Do you wanna stay in Communications?
Not sure I wanna stay in the government.
- Consulting work is big, I hear.
- I'm feeling sentimental about California.
- California?
- The local political work.
There's something romantic about it, really.
- Romantic.
- Overseeing a mayoral race in a city that needs a breath of fresh air.
Sounds nice.
I'm gonna...
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Keep me updated on the exit polls.
That's what I said, listen to this:
"With victory assured in Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania Santos should prepare to lend his image to the history books."
- What is that?
- A blog.
It goes on to call him our first Latino president.
- They don't say "candidate"?
- President.
They call it in three states, though the polls don't close for hours.
- Burn in hell.
- They're checking the same data as us.
Posting raw exit poll data without explanation or analysis, it's irresponsible.
Worse for Vinick, they're calling him a loser.
Last thing we want, Democrats thinking they don't need to go to polls because Santos has it in the bag.
- Or Vinick supporters turning out in droves.
- Will you please?
Anybody who's checking out exit polling on a blog voted first thing this morning at 6:45 a.m.
Not if the nets pick them up and report it as news.
Do you think someone's gonna look at "Bernard's Blogland" and mistake it for network news?
It could affect turnout.
How big do you think the readership is?
Four years ago, Bartlet won New Mexico with only 6000 votes.
- Call the networks and...
- Don't, don't, don't!
Anybody see these numbers in New England?
Turnout is down 15 percent in Vermont!
- Josh.
- How are we up in South Carolina and not get people in Vermont?
We got lines in Ohio, we're sending port-a-potties to districts down there so that people don't leave, but the numbers are still low!
We're losing in Maine, a state that Bartlet won with 67 percent of the vote!
The Latino vote in Florida isn't turning out but Rhode Island, they're coming out...
- Josh!
- It's Texas.
Shouldn't it be warm?
- Not in November.
What are you doing out here?
- I've been appointed.
- To what?
- Make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine.
Make sure your head's not actually gonna explode.
- These numbers aren't adding up.
- They never do.
You've been working 18-, 20-hour days for the last year.
- Yeah.
- It's here.
There's nothing to do but let it run its course.
There's nothing left to do, Josh.
In the event that he loses Texas but wins the election we don't wanna get caught with out pants down.
Let me make sure we have this.
They need one if he wins or loses, one if he loses the Latino vote one if he wins the electoral vote, one if he loses the electoral vote and one if he loses his home state.
- Right.
What if two of those things happen?
What if he loses his home state and Latino vote?
- That too.
- What are we talking about?
- The speeches.
- We should have one in case the race is too close to call.
The polls are about to close.
We should get in.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I sort of walked away from you before.
- It got weird all of a sudden.
- Yeah.
Was it something about California?
No, California's a lovely state.
- Doesn't mean I have to move there.
- What?
- If it means we would have to end...
- No, I would never want...
- lf you're planning on staying in D. C...
- I'd never ask you to stay.
You spend the night at my house more often than not.
- Which makes me...?
- A really good date.
I'm not like you.
I don't live and die with the Democratic Party.
I wanna see the next president through this crisis, whoever he is.
You keep saying, "The next president, whoever he is."
Yeah, well, the NSC is a nonpartisan...
Did you vote for Vinick?
You voted for Arnold Vinick?
He hasn't stopped looking at those numbers.
- Hope springs eternal.
Maybe you...
- Yeah.
East Coast polls are closing in a few minutes.
In South Carolina, Santos is up by four.
The African-American population has been oversampled.
They're 34 percent of the interviews and only 29 percent of the voters.
- Bruno...
- In Pennsylvania women are oversampled.
It's wrong.
We're losing North Dakota, a state that's gone Republican for the last 40 years.
- Doesn't give a moment's pause?
- What are you gonna do?
Minnesota, fifth district, the most Democratic district in the state.
Bartlet won it with 71 percent four years ago.
Santos is only pulling in 54 percent.
This isn't over.
- We could be winning...
- You've done a hell of a job.
The nuclear thing, there's no way you could have anticipated that.
In a few seconds, six states will close their polls.
Once all the precincts in those states are closed we'll be able to start bringing you the results of this election.
It has been a long and formidable campaign and it's coming to a close.
We will get you all the information you need to know as quickly as possible.
Right now, we can project that Senator Arnold Vinick will carry Indiana and its 11 electoral votes and Kentucky and its eight electoral votes.
What about Georgia or Vermont or South Carolina or Virginia?
- We get none?
- Be patient.
Set up a line to the DNC Headquarters.
Want a tally of the Congressional races.
I wanna hear about Velasquez.
Leo's gonna sleep through the whole thing.
I gotta get him.
What can I say?
Nerves of steel.
Gotta get him cleaned up for the party.
He's been threatening to wear his robe.
Nothing says victory like threadbare flannel.
Hispanics are favored in six congressional races in Texas and Rhode Island is on its way to electing its first Hispanic congressman.
Something's happening.
We are getting word of a new development.
West Virginia is a state that Democrats had hoped to carry.
We are projecting that this state and its five electoral votes will go to Senator Arnold Vinick.
Historically...
- Hey.
- Hey, you.
- I slept.
- You did.
- And lost West Virginia, apparently.
- And Kentucky and Indiana.
- I'm a loser.
- Oh, 24 to nothing, baby.
But you can still rebound.
I have faith.
- Where are you?
- What?
In your head, where did you go?
I'm just thinking about what I'm gonna do tomorrow.
We'll take the kids to school and then go for breakfast.
Bacon and pancakes.
The backyard needs raking.
If we look closer at a few of these key states, New Jersey, for instance could end up being a disappointment for Vinick if it does indeed swing toward the Democrats.
Santos has been polling here well in the last couple of weeks although the Vinick camp clung to the idea that the security factor could play well to voters in New Jersey.
I'm sure a lot of people are asking why we still have not...
You wanna take those job offers home?
No, thanks.
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Maybe after Christmas.
- Maybe next week.
- Why are we still talking?
- Honestly?
- Yeah.
You're a savvy woman who could easily consider world domination as a next career move.
And I'd like to continue working with you, if that's a possibility.
Right.
You can pack up some of these for me to take home tonight.
Thank you.
On that note, it is exactly 8:07 p.m. On the East Coast.
We are ready to project now that Congressman Matthew Santos will carry the state of Pennsylvania.
- Unbelievable!
- We did it!
- I can't believe it.
- Twenty-one electoral votes.
- Hey.
- I talked to my mother today.
She watches CNN, talks to all her friends and reports to me each of their predictions with equal weight.
All the time, money and energy we spent trying to shake things up what if the electoral map looks like we thought three months ago?
Florida and Ohio go to Vinick.
We take New York, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
- And it all comes down to California.
- The fly-over states and the East Coast.
It happens during every campaign.
You had to make the tough choices.
Something wrong with these numbers.
Vermont, voters swear that they'd vote for a Latino president but the state is splitting 49-49, Santos and Vinick.
We ran a Latino Democrat against a tax-cutting, moderate Republican...
Maine has been trending towards Santos all day but voters are listing security and taxes as the major issues.
What are they lying about?
What they care about or who they're voting for?
We're even playing in Louisiana.
Teddy and Lou are through the roof.
But look at the exit polls.
The data is skewed towards women and African-Americans.
The white men cast their votes after work.
What happens then?
We don't have this wrapped up.
What is the overall sensation here tonight?
That it's going to be very close.
The election will be a very close one.
The campaigns have been planning for it.
We have been planning for it.
It could be a very long night for Matt Santos and Arnold Vinick.
Congratulations, sir.
South Carolina's just been called for you.
He's gonna wanna be up for this.
Mind letting me in?
Leo.
Hello?
Leo?
Leo?
Leo!
Somebody help me!
- Call 911!
- He's down, let's go!
He's down!
He's down!
Requesting ambulance at service entrance, northeast side.

Previously on The West Wing:
Santos could take a vacation and just let the press keep hammering me on this nuclear thing.
Ohio trends Santos!
That's the story of the day.
The voters set the terms of the elections, not us.
They get to decide what's important, not us.
If I win California, I win the country.
We need to be prepared for a court battle.
- You think we're gonna win?
- I do.
The real decision the American people have to make is who do they want as their next commander in chief.
- We're tied.
- Holy mother of God, we caught him!
- Yes!
- We caught him!
Scotch, please.
Your best.
I need seven glasses.
And I'll keep the bottle.
I'd believe we were in Houston if I saw more cowboy hats.
- It's rude indoors.
- Maybe it's a stereotype.
- It could be Denver.
Could be St. Louis.
- Chicago.
Phoenix, Salt Lake City.
All that time we spent there.
You have to accept the fact that this is all coming to an end tomorrow.
And a single tear slips slowly down your cheek.
Or you can get really hammered.
Everybody needs to relax.
Except you.
The bartender needs your credit card.
So who's planned for the rest of their lives?
I want a meal that isn't Cheetos and a Diet Sprite.
- I want a pedicure.
- I wanna be a White House speechwriter.
- Don't say that out loud.
- Bad karma, man.
- Then Cheetos sounds good.
- I'd settle for more than two hours' sleep.
- Where was the bat loose in the hall?
- That you caught with a pillowcase?
- That one.
- Portland.
A hundred and seventy-five dollars a bottle?
Next time, get a pitcher of whatever's on tap.
Next time?
The congressman will be wrapping up in L.A.
Who wants to stay sober long enough to get the report from Bram?
Thanks for volunteering, Edie.
- Think I'm gonna call it a night.
- So early?
God created few nights in life without midnight rallies airplane seats and tracking polls.
I'm gonna enjoy one.
Staff meeting, 6 a.m. Tomorrow.
We'll go over new marching orders then.
So I'll send out an e-mail about L.A. later.
- Really?
- Apparently.
- Should you be drinking like that?
- Like what?
You're 23 years old with a shocking lack of facial hair.
Do you really wanna tell a grown woman how to drink?
I didn't think so.
Bedtime.
You can take the bottle if you want.
Yeah me too.
See you guys in the morning.
- How did I miss that?
- You might've had an easier year of it if you had come onboard.
- Six o'clock tomorrow morning, right?
- Yeah.
Wow, Cindy?
- Did you know that?
- About Ronna and Cindy?
- Any of them.
- Yes.
- Which one?
- All of them.
Did you ever come onboard?
No.
Never had a campaign fling?
No.
Do you want another drink?
No.
- It's 3 a.m.
- Yeah.
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little.
You?
Yeah.
- You don't have to leave.
- I know.
- I mean, you don't have to sneak out.
- I wasn't.
I didn't wanna make this awkward, but I just did.
I was just checking the news sites.
- And the sweater?
- For warmth.
Why don't I go get us some coffee?
- How are you feeling?
- I really wanna win this thing.
- Coffee would be great.
Cream and...
- Three sugars.
I already checked AP.
Nothing new.
You should take a look at Reuters.
Scotch, Otto, exercise.
You should rehydrate.
I was hoping to escape you for a little while.
Well, the front-desk clerk gave you up.
He say, "Lou's on the treadmill, go seek her out"?
He said he opened the gym for a lady with liquor breath and crazy eyes.
- What do you got there?
- Vinick made a crack last night about the congressman's lack of foreign-policy experience.
Well, it's hard to effectively fire back at him on Election Day.
Only two and a half hours before the polls open in the East.
Yeah.
"Thank you all for joining me in Houston on this historic evening.
Tonight, I'm both honored and humbled by the certitude..."
Hey, no one actually uses the word "certitude."
Not really.
You couldn't sleep either?
Final pass at the victory and concession speeches.
It was either this or a solitaire tournament with the Advance guys.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Welcome to the club.
- No one can sleep.
- Evidently.
- You see Reuters?
Vinick said the congressman couldn't handle the Kazakhstan crisis last night.
Well, a response won't do much good now but we've got Bartlet cabinet members doing satellite spin.
They can mention our guy's military experience.
- All right, great.
- Would you check on this for me?
Thanks.
Tell me you found my pantyhose.
Thank you.
- This is it.
- It's less glamorous than I imagined.
We sold the leather couches for our last media buy.
Funny man.
Pretty witty.
Makes me want to...
- I should check the fax.
- I already did.
You got nothing better to do at 4 in the morning?
Apparently not.
- Jane Braun, Carrie...?
- Marino.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
- Senator hit Santos on Kazakhstan.
- Yeah, I saw.
- It may be too little, too late.
- Well, it was worth a shot.
- When's he landing?
- An hour and a half at LAX then up to Santa Paula to vote.
- Yeah.
Bathroom?
- Oh, it's...
left.
- Oh, second door on your left.
Thank you.
- She's cute.
- Yeah.
- Little young.
- Yale grad.
Almost grad.
- Couldn't sleep.
- Oh, sure.
God, I hate the waiting.
- Say something.
- Nothing to say.
Someone should tell me to change my shirt or not to change the health-care section of the speech or where we're going next.
- We're going to vote and then home.
- The stump speech?
- Delivered for the last time.
- And we're not running late?
- Right on time.
Unbelievable.
- Hey, you look great.
- I changed.
- Yeah, I noticed.
- Thanks.
- Teddy's got the war room running?
- Yeah.
I didn't want to be wearing the same clothes as last night.
How's our Get Out the Vote effort looking?
Great, I hope.
You don't have to worry.
A lot of people are gonna be doing the walk of shame today.
Not that what we did was shameful.
Or is shameful.
That's not what I meant.
- So...
- Here's everything we talked about.
250,000 volunteers nationwide knocking on doors, escorting voters to the polls.
- Where are the surrogates?
- We've got surrogates doing news in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and California.
- Russell?
- He's in Colorado today but he's available for satellites.
Griffith, Atkins and Baker are available to fly wherever we need them depending on the polls.
- Hispanic vote?
Radio spots targeting largely Hispanic counties in California and Florida.
The congressman will hit Texas today with some drive-time radio.
- Right.
- We got it completely handled, Josh.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Really?
- Really.
This is it.
The wait begins.
Well, it's about time for you to do your thing.
- My thing?
- Thank the troops.
You did realize you were gonna have to do that.
Right, right.
Hey, everyone.
Gather round.
I didn't know most of you before last January, and...
Wow, it's been a long 11 months.
I hope you've all learned a lot.
I know that I learned a few things from you.
For instance, I didn't know that I would need to explain that we don't do shout-outs during radio interviews.
And we don't encourage college buddies to hurl expletives at our opponent.
Who was responsible for that thing in Dubuque, anyway?
Who was it?
- Dave.
- Dave.
Dave, Dave.
Take a bow.
You fired him.
Well, wherever you are, thanks for the lesson.
It's a special day.
A high point in your young, impressionable lives.
So go, take a few minutes to enjoy it.
And then call your family and friends.
Make sure they voted.
Ask about the lines at their precincts so we know if Get Out the Vote works.
They can report any harassment, anything weird.
Or if it's snowing, whatever.
They can tell you that.
I'm serious.
Call them.
- Good group.
- Yeah.
You might wanna work the phrase "thank you" in there.
- Thank you.
Appreciate it.
- Okey-dokey.
Polls open in five, four, three two, one.
Senator Arnold Vinick's campaign made its final stop of the election season here in Santa Paula, California.
Senator Vinick returns to his hometown with a different goal...
Come in.
- Breakfast.
- Are we going steady?
- You called me.
- The speeches.
You approved them.
One if we win, one if we lose.
- We might need another one.
- Isn't it black and white?
We placed a lot of emphasis on him being the first Hispanic candidate.
We need one in case he doesn't sweep the Hispanic vote.
- Okay.
- You know, be prepared.
Great.
Are you waiting for a hug or something?
- Isn't going to go down without a fight.
Thank you.
California, Nevada, Washington, Idaho.
Polls are now open everywhere.
Alaska and Hawaii aren't open yet.
Two states on which the outcome of the race so often depends.
Like Idaho was ever the linchpin.
Senator's voting, then meeting his daughter for breakfast.
- Anybody ready to order lunch?
- The sun came up an hour ago.
I'm starving.
The Hispanic turnout in Florida?
Swenson's been out all morning.
We got 10,000 volunteers in Jacksonville, Orlando and Miami.
- And Get Out the Vote is...?
- What's this?
He's just voting now?
- We now go live to Houston.
- It's 9 a.m. In Texas.
He missed morning coverage in the East.
Yeah, but he cut into our California coverage perfectly.
After hosting a rally in Los Angeles...
- They'll switch from Vinick to Santos.
- Lou's a genius.
How was last night?
He changed the health-care portion of the stump again but otherwise, 45,000 screaming devotees.
Kind of cult-like.
How is he today?
- He's relaxed.
- You're kidding?
No, it's kind of weird, calm.
We're heading back to the house.
- How long to the first exit polls?
- Couple of hours.
I can 't tell you how badly I need a shower.
Four rallies in four states, four buses, three flights.
- You can probably smell me...
- Hold on.
Boston!
We need turnout in Boston, huge turnout.
Vinick will win western Massachusetts.
He's gonna take Cape Cod.
Need to up the score in Boston.
- Yeah.
- It's raining.
Yeah, well, she beat you to the punch.
Though we were already monitoring road conditions and traffic patterns.
The Massachusetts field ops called, said they are distributing umbrellas so volunteers can escort voters from cars to polling places.
- Should we do some additional...
- Drive-time?
Scheduled for 3:00.
The National Weather Service said there's a high-pressure system coming.
It should stop the rain by 2:00.
Good news is, showers should linger over the Berkshires slowing down any Vinick supporters still getting to the polls.
We're getting new weather models every half hour.
- You wanna see them?
- No, we're fine.
Don't need it.
Josh, we are completely and totally under control.
We've been planning this for five months.
You know what?
I was in the elevator today.
I was talking to a man who didn't even know it was Election Day.
Jeremy, ride the elevator for a few hours.
Anyone from Houston, remind them to vote.
I was thinking, we should do an additional speech.
- One in the event...
- Hispanic vote draft.
Wanna take a look?
- The popular vote is different from the Electoral College vote.
Another if...
I got you.
You want two speeches.
One if we win the electoral and lose the popular and the vice versa.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
Two more?
- Two more.
Do two.
You're right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Drew.
What are you doing right now?
Bram asked me to make sure everything's going smoothly for the party tonight.
- They're about to do sound checks.
- Cool.
You mind if I come along with you?
Sure.
If you're heading toward my office, you should rethink that.
- Job offers.
- Talk to me about the election.
- No word yet on the exit polls.
- Fine.
Margaret's been setting up meetings with employers.
I took it upon myself to do research.
She's supposed to schedule them in January.
CEOs are busy.
They schedule January meetings in November.
Board of Directors at Johnson Johnson Lockheed Martin, Boeing, SBC.
President of Human Resources at GE.
Kennedy School needs a new dean.
Everyone wants you.
- Is today the day for this?
- One has offices in Prague but you have to be fluent in Czech.
Another, a company jet.
Not Air Force One, but not bad.
A lot have stock options, something you should look into.
Suckers could be worth something someday.
Three thousand people have been invited.
Thirty thousand are gonna try to make it through the door.
Well, security is setting up overflow areas outside.
Is that The Foo Fighters?
- Foo Fighters.
- Yeah.
Well, it's not "The" Foo Fighters.
Yeah, that is them.
We've actually got nine performers doing sets from 7 to midnight, so...
I love Foo Fighters.
These guys voted, right?
- Josh Lyman.
- Where are you?
I'm in the Grand Ballroom, supervising.
I've been looking for you.
Yeah, I didn't know if you needed some space or...
We just got the first round of exit polls.
- What?
- The exit polls.
They're here.
- Where are the kids?
- School.
It's a Tuesday.
Kind of a big day.
They'll be home by 3.
What do I do here all day?
- You could sleep.
- No, I don't think so.
Come on.
I don't think I can close my eyes.
Then we'll find something else to do.
- What do we got?
- I got you something.
- A gift?
- Whatever.
Markers.
Blue markers.
Check it out.
See for yourself.
Fill it?
North Carolina, we're up by one.
- Up by two in Georgia.
- Georgia?
Look at Louisiana and Virginia.
All over the South we are in it.
The military vote is going for Santos.
All the Republican-value voters are staying home.
We're only up by six in Massachusetts.
Isn't that low?
It's raining.
Ahead by 12 points in New York, seven in New Jersey.
- Even in Texas.
- It's still early.
We're playing in the South?
And Maryland, Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware.
We can put most of the Northeast in our pocket.
Cautious optimism.
Your face is frozen in an odd way.
Unattractively?
Not entirely.
I think my head's gonna explode.
Maybe we should take a walk or something.
Try to de-stress a little before the next numbers come out.
You wanna take a walk or something?
You want some water?
You have a bottle over there?
- Tap water.
- No, thanks.
But thank you.
Mind if I turn on the TV?
See if there's news?
Please.
At least I didn't bring my BlackBerry to bed.
Could be worse.
Less romantic, I mean.
Got it.
President Bartlet and his wife went home to Manchester, New Hampshire last night and visited their local polling place this morning.
- This may sound silly...
- No, what?
I'm worried about the law in Minnesota, prohibiting media and pollsters within 100 feet of polling places.
That's certainly less romantic.
I was looking at the county data earlier.
In Dakota County Republicans have a 16 percent edge in voters but exit polls show us leading.
I wonder if the law's affecting the accuracy of numbers.
Am I just being paranoid?
I'm just being paranoid.
Forget it.
- Hello?
- Hey can you pull all the numbers coming out of Minnesota?
Thanks.
Speedy.
- Hello?
- Hello?
- Hang on.
- Do you have Donna?
- What?
- Do you have Donna?
- Have her?
- Do you know where she is?
Yeah.
- Is Josh in there?
- Yeah.
Can you tell Donna, Lou needs her to do some spin on MSNBC.
And I have Minnesota numbers for you.
Up one in South Carolina, two in Tennessee.
Ahead in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, only up by one in California.
We gotta keep him moving.
San Diego, Dana Point, Newport Beach, Los Angeles.
- We need to schedule drive time.
- While he's traveling.
Annie?
- Yeah.
- These Minnesota numbers are off.
We should have more of an edge.
Dakota County has Santos leading by eight points.
The youth vote is up, mostly Democratic.
It's throwing off our numbers.
That should taper off as working people vote.
- I shouldn't worry, right?
- You shouldn't.
Superstitious.
One of my Election Day good-luck routines.
- One of?
- You met Carrie already.
Senator Arnold Vinick campaigned through his home state this afternoon hosting events along the coast of Southern California...
Where else has he been today?
Rally in San Diego and Dana Point.
- What did his public schedule say?
- Voting in Santa Paula.
- We should have him in California.
- Little late.
Hundred and fifty thousand square miles in California, 13 million voters.
We can't plant him in a mall and hope he reaches the undecideds.
- That's what Vinick's doing.
- Donna's doing spin and the congressman will hit L.A. With some drive-time radio.
Leo have an impact in Akron?
I heard 17,000 voters didn't budge when the skies opened and dumped buckets of water down on them.
- It's fine, we'll reach those undecideds.
Oh, well, I think we already have.
New exit polls are in.
Illinois South Carolina?
Are you kidding?
Thanks, Edie.
Yeah, I'll let him know.
- So?
- We're up four in Colorado five in Connecticut, three in Illinois, seven in Maryland.
- Pennsylvania, Michigan?
- Both by two.
And we moved ahead in California.
You wanna tell him or should I?
He's asleep.
Really?
Really.
Should we wake him up?
No.
The kids will be here any minute.
Let him sleep.
- Down by three in South Carolina.
- That can't be right.
Down by two in California.
Are you watching this?
We're ahead in North Carolina and South Carolina.
When 's the last time a Democrat played in that region?
I'm not even sure I was born yet...
Has everyone seen these numbers out of Syracuse?
Yeah, the Senator's winning with 53 percent of the vote.
Well, that should be somewhere around 65 percent.
Excuse me, 154 electoral votes if the states were being called right now.
- Including Florida?
- No.
So 181, if we're being optimistic.
Are we being optimistic?
Vermont turnout's down 15 percent.
New Hampshire.
Minnesota...
Something's not right here.
Okay, based on exit polls, I've got 201.
With or without Texas?
- Without.
- We could be at 235?
Nuclear accident came in handy.
We're encouraged by the strong showing in the Midwest, John.
Turnout's up six percent in California alone.
Voters want a change and they know Arnold Vinick can deliver...
- Someone didn't see the poll.
- They call it "spin" for a reason.
- How's that adolescent part feeling now?
- Happier, thanks.
Did you hear some staffers talking about what posters they wanna hang at the White House?
- Who was doing that?
A couple of guys with accents in Advance.
- Minnesota doesn't make sense.
- Don't sweat Dakota County,
As long as we're pounding Vinick in the fourth and fifth districts, we're golden.
- Hey, stranger.
- What's it been, about eight hours?
I saw your briefing.
Apple cider and "lame duck" jokes?
That all you got?
As opposed to watching briefings on C-SPAN and roaming the halls to gossip.
I try to prevent war in East Asia, too, but...
- I apparently get to look for a job.
- In the Santos administration?
- Exit polls are reading that way.
- Do you wanna stay in Communications?
Not sure I wanna stay in the government.
- Consulting work is big, I hear.
- I'm feeling sentimental about California.
- California?
- The local political work.
There's something romantic about it, really.
- Romantic.
- Overseeing a mayoral race in a city that needs a breath of fresh air.
Sounds nice.
I'm gonna...
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Keep me updated on the exit polls.
That's what I said, listen to this:
"With victory assured in Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania Santos should prepare to lend his image to the history books."
- What is that?
- A blog.
It goes on to call him our first Latino president.
- They don't say "candidate"?
- President.
They call it in three states, though the polls don't close for hours.
- Burn in hell.
- They're checking the same data as us.
Posting raw exit poll data without explanation or analysis, it's irresponsible.
Worse for Vinick, they're calling him a loser.
Last thing we want, Democrats thinking they don't need to go to polls because Santos has it in the bag.
- Or Vinick supporters turning out in droves.
- Will you please?
Anybody who's checking out exit polling on a blog voted first thing this morning at 6:45 a.m.
Not if the nets pick them up and report it as news.
Do you think someone's gonna look at "Bernard's Blogland" and mistake it for network news?
It could affect turnout.
How big do you think the readership is?
Four years ago, Bartlet won New Mexico with only 6000 votes.
- Call the networks and...
- Don't, don't, don't!
Anybody see these numbers in New England?
Turnout is down 15 percent in Vermont!
- Josh.
- How are we up in South Carolina and not get people in Vermont?
We got lines in Ohio, we're sending port-a-potties to districts down there so that people don't leave, but the numbers are still low!
We're losing in Maine, a state that Bartlet won with 67 percent of the vote!
The Latino vote in Florida isn't turning out but Rhode Island, they're coming out...
- Josh!
- It's Texas.
Shouldn't it be warm?
- Not in November.
What are you doing out here?
- I've been appointed.
- To what?
- Make sure you're okay.
- I'm fine.
Make sure your head's not actually gonna explode.
- These numbers aren't adding up.
- They never do.
You've been working 18-, 20-hour days for the last year.
- Yeah.
- It's here.
There's nothing to do but let it run its course.
There's nothing left to do, Josh.
In the event that he loses Texas but wins the election we don't wanna get caught with out pants down.
Let me make sure we have this.
They need one if he wins or loses, one if he loses the Latino vote one if he wins the electoral vote, one if he loses the electoral vote and one if he loses his home state.
- Right.
What if two of those things happen?
What if he loses his home state and Latino vote?
- That too.
- What are we talking about?
- The speeches.
- We should have one in case the race is too close to call.
The polls are about to close.
We should get in.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I sort of walked away from you before.
- It got weird all of a sudden.
- Yeah.
Was it something about California?
No, California's a lovely state.
- Doesn't mean I have to move there.
- What?
- If it means we would have to end...
- No, I would never want...
- lf you're planning on staying in D. C...
- I'd never ask you to stay.
You spend the night at my house more often than not.
- Which makes me...?
- A really good date.
I'm not like you.
I don't live and die with the Democratic Party.
I wanna see the next president through this crisis, whoever he is.
You keep saying, "The next president, whoever he is."
Yeah, well, the NSC is a nonpartisan...
Did you vote for Vinick?
You voted for Arnold Vinick?
He hasn't stopped looking at those numbers.
- Hope springs eternal.
Maybe you...
- Yeah.
East Coast polls are closing in a few minutes.
In South Carolina, Santos is up by four.
The African-American population has been oversampled.
They're 34 percent of the interviews and only 29 percent of the voters.
- Bruno...
- In Pennsylvania women are oversampled.
It's wrong.
We're losing North Dakota, a state that's gone Republican for the last 40 years.
- Doesn't give a moment's pause?
- What are you gonna do?
Minnesota, fifth district, the most Democratic district in the state.
Bartlet won it with 71 percent four years ago.
Santos is only pulling in 54 percent.
This isn't over.
- We could be winning...
- You've done a hell of a job.
The nuclear thing, there's no way you could have anticipated that.
In a few seconds, six states will close their polls.
Once all the precincts in those states are closed we'll be able to start bringing you the results of this election.
It has been a long and formidable campaign and it's coming to a close.
We will get you all the information you need to know as quickly as possible.
Right now, we can project that Senator Arnold Vinick will carry Indiana and its 11 electoral votes and Kentucky and its eight electoral votes.
What about Georgia or Vermont or South Carolina or Virginia?
- We get none?
- Be patient.
Set up a line to the DNC Headquarters.
Want a tally of the Congressional races.
I wanna hear about Velasquez.
Leo's gonna sleep through the whole thing.
I gotta get him.
What can I say?
Nerves of steel.
Gotta get him cleaned up for the party.
He's been threatening to wear his robe.
Nothing says victory like threadbare flannel.
Hispanics are favored in six congressional races in Texas and Rhode Island is on its way to electing its first Hispanic congressman.
Something's happening.
We are getting word of a new development.
West Virginia is a state that Democrats had hoped to carry.
We are projecting that this state and its five electoral votes will go to Senator Arnold Vinick.
Historically...
- Hey.
- Hey, you.
- I slept.
- You did.
- And lost West Virginia, apparently.
- And Kentucky and Indiana.
- I'm a loser.
- Oh, 24 to nothing, baby.
But you can still rebound.
I have faith.
- Where are you?
- What?
In your head, where did you go?
I'm just thinking about what I'm gonna do tomorrow.
We'll take the kids to school and then go for breakfast.
Bacon and pancakes.
The backyard needs raking.
If we look closer at a few of these key states, New Jersey, for instance could end up being a disappointment for Vinick if it does indeed swing toward the Democrats.
Santos has been polling here well in the last couple of weeks although the Vinick camp clung to the idea that the security factor could play well to voters in New Jersey.
I'm sure a lot of people are asking why we still have not...
You wanna take those job offers home?
No, thanks.
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Maybe after Christmas.
- Maybe next week.
- Why are we still talking?
- Honestly?
- Yeah.
You're a savvy woman who could easily consider world domination as a next career move.
And I'd like to continue working with you, if that's a possibility.
Right.
You can pack up some of these for me to take home tonight.
Thank you.
On that note, it is exactly 8:07 p.m. On the East Coast.
We are ready to project now that Congressman Matthew Santos will carry the state of Pennsylvania.
- Unbelievable!
- We did it!
- I can't believe it.
- Twenty-one electoral votes.
- Hey.
- I talked to my mother today.
She watches CNN, talks to all her friends and reports to me each of their predictions with equal weight.
All the time, money and energy we spent trying to shake things up what if the electoral map looks like we thought three months ago?
Florida and Ohio go to Vinick.
We take New York, Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
- And it all comes down to California.
- The fly-over states and the East Coast.
It happens during every campaign.
You had to make the tough choices.
Something wrong with these numbers.
Vermont, voters swear that they'd vote for a Latino president but the state is splitting 49-49, Santos and Vinick.
We ran a Latino Democrat against a tax-cutting, moderate Republican...
Maine has been trending towards Santos all day but voters are listing security and taxes as the major issues.
What are they lying about?
What they care about or who they're voting for?
We're even playing in Louisiana.
Teddy and Lou are through the roof.
But look at the exit polls.
The data is skewed towards women and African-Americans.
The white men cast their votes after work.
What happens then?
We don't have this wrapped up.
What is the overall sensation here tonight?
That it's going to be very close.
The election will be a very close one.
The campaigns have been planning for it.
We have been planning for it.
It could be a very long night for Matt Santos and Arnold Vinick.
Congratulations, sir.
South Carolina's just been called for you.
He's gonna wanna be up for this.
Mind letting me in?
Leo.
Hello?
Leo?
Leo?
Leo!
Somebody help me!
- Call 911!
- He's down, let's go!
He's down!
He's down!
Requesting ambulance at service entrance, northeast side.

It means a lot to her to feel included.
Sometimes dark clouds have silver linings... (Susan) He sort of asked me out.
It's okay with you if I go out with him?
- sometimes they don't.
Once that baby comes, I'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone.

Desperate Housewives - season 3 episode 2 "It Takes Two"
(Mary Alice) Brides are sensitive creatures, and no one knows this better than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them.
Well, I think a 10-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice, and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it.
Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.
Uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet?
But if you got a band, maybe people could dance, as opposed to sway.
But the one area where a bridesmaid's tact is most required involves the dress...
So what do you think?
she's required to wear.
Well, um...
I'm not sure that I've ever seen this shade of green before.
Yeah, don't you think it'll be gorgeous with my coloring?
Yes, it would look perfect.
For someone with your coloring.
I mean, I was lucky to find these-- not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
Then why the rush?
Yeah, Bree, I'd have thought of you as a person who wants time to plan.
Well, Orson and I talked about it, and we just feel, at our age -- it's silly to wait.
And with your help, I'm sure we can get it all done.
- Well, we are happy...
Oh, uh, that reminds me.
I have to get a copy of the seating chart for you.
Gaby, you are in charge of the centerpieces.
And don't worry, Susan.
I will think of a job for you.
Here's a job.
How about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
Susan, we don't know that!
All we have is some crazy woman's accusations.
His wife vanished, and he didn't even tell Bree.
How much more proof do you need?
He says he's innocent.
She believes him.
If we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us.
Well, I'm sorry.
I cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life!
(Bree) ahem!
And what mistake would that be?
Well... um... honestly... yes, a bridesmaid can question many of the bride's choices.
These dresses are hideous.
but the groom isn't one of them.
**
the perfect couple... we've all met them, haven't we?
that man and woman so clearly made for each other, we feel certain they're on the road to happiness.
but that road has many detours, and even perfect couples can find themselves... at a dead end.
(Carlos) you want what?
!
You heard me.
And I want the bedroom stereo.
I want the marble console and that painting of St. Augustine.
You don't even know who he is.
I know he matches the drapes.
- People, can we focus here?
And I want my pearl necklace back.
Don't think I didn't notice that you swiped it.
- That was my Mamá's
I think it belongs in my family.
- There was a time
I belonged in your family, and you got over that.
Stop eating my fries!
- I'm hungry.
You know what the doctor said.
You should see his cholesterol.
This man bleeds baking grease.
- Enough!
You two are gonna have to find a way to deal with each other, because you are about to bring a child into this world.
And divorced or not, once that child arrives, you will be bound together for as long as you live.
Well, in that case...
Have some more fries.
I'll pick Kayla up on Sunday.
Whenever.
Just go.
You and Turk have a great time.
Oh, trust me, we will.
The man is a jackhammer.
- Ah.
Bye, Tom.
Bye.
See you Sunday!
Where is she goin'?
She and Turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
That's Turk?
That's the new boyfriend?
Unh-unh, no.
Hey, hey, hey, Tom, please.
I don't want my daughter hanging around with a guy like that.
You haven't even met him.
He could be the sweetest man in the world.
(squeals) Ha ha!
Ooh.
More importantly, ever since he entered the picture, squeaky Fromme is never around.
It has been bliss.
I haven't made this face...
in a week.
If you ruin this, so help me, I will hurt you.
Just look at him.
look at him, please.
I swear, that is a child's skull hanging from his rearview mirror.
Doesn't that concern you?
No, I'm good.
Could be a monkey.
Uh, I think I will have the...
Mesclun salad.
That's it?
That's all you're having?
(whispering) well, all the food is very expensive.
You don't need to whisper.
The waiter knows they're robbing us blind.
You can have whatever you want.
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll just have Jane moved to the V.A. hospital.
- Oh, my god.
I'm kidding.
It's fine.
I'll have what she's having.
Of course.
Thank you.
God, I love seeing you laugh.
Oh, well, it's been a long time since I've been in the mood to.
- Thank you.
Oh, dear god!
Did I squeeze too hard?
No, it's my wife's parents.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Oh, is this gonna be awkward?
No, no, no, not unless, of course, they see us.
(man) Ian?
- Awkward.
Jeff, Renee, what a delightful surprise.
(chuckles)
It's so good to see you, dear.
Hello.
I'm Renee, and this my husband Jeff.
Susan Mayer.
Uh, doctor...
Dr. Susan Mayer--she's new To Jane's neurology team.
Oh!
I just assumed you worked In Ian's publishing house.
Well, yes, and how--how nice that would've been, huh?
Um, but, no, no, I'm a... a brain specialist.
Well, Dr. Mayer, maybe I can ask you, our daughter's most recent E.E.G. showed brain spikes, but it didn't change the score on the Glasgow scale.
Why is that?
What an excellent question.
And this is the, uh... spinal cord.
- Uh-huh.
And it, of course, attaches to the brain.
You don't have to dumb it down for us, doctor.
We've been dealing with Jane's condition for years.
Oh, good.
Um, well, then let's--let's get technical.
Uh, let's give Dr. Mayer the night off.
She was in surgery for ten hours today performing a craniotomy.
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.
How'd it go?
Uh, well, it just--
Wow!
I hear my-- my phone vibrating.
Um, hello, uh, Dr. Mayer.
Yeah, what?
You say that his brain shut off?
Oh, well, I'll be right there.
Um, stat.
I'm sorry.
(chuckles nervously) duty calls.
Orson?
I moved the furniture back!
Good lord, Bree, not again.
(jazz music playing)
Don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
There'll be 200 people staring at us.
You know, Bree... since that incident at our engagement party, there's been a lot of dark talk about me.
Well, I don't pay attention to gossip.
I'm just saying I would understand if you had second thoughts about marrying a man who's under a cloud.
Well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman.
Strangers may talk, but I know the truth.
Really?
Men have lied to me before.
Believe me, that'll never happen again.
So you trust me completely?
Clearly, I do.
The body is unusually well-preserved because it was buried in clay.
Do we have a cause of death?
Blunt force trauma to the head.
I want you to pull all the missing persons reports, cross-check against her height, age and weight.
I'm also running a DNA panel since we won't be able to use her dental records.
Why not?
Whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth.
Nora?
What are you doing back?
Are you okay?
Shut the door!
Okay.
I don't want Kayla to find me like this.
What's wrong?
Turk and I had a fight.
What?
No!
No, no, no!
What happened?
What happened is, Turk is an ass!
On the way to the river, we stopped off at this bar.
And we were playing pool, and I got a little bitchy with one of the waitresses.
Who cares, right?
I mean, who cares?
It's a bar, and we all do it, right?
- R-right.
So he tells me to watch my mouth.
And I'm like, whoa!
Get a load of Mr. Two Strikes trying to tell me how to act in public.
And then he called me a whore.
We're done.
Okay, whoa!
Whoa!
Take a deep breath.
You don't break up with a guy because in a weak moment he calls you a whore.
And then on the way out, he threatened to hit me.
Okay, but he didn't.
He didn't.
And, you know, until--
Oh, jeez, Lynette, whose side are you on?
!
I'm on the side of love.
You guys seem like such a perfect couple.
I know.
I just--I-I...
You know, you don't wanna Throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.
(sniffles loudly)
No. it's over.
I just got off the phone with Turk's parole officer, and I was like, "guess who ain't in Nevada no more?" Click.
(sobbing)
I think I'm gonna have to stay here tonight.
(rattling in distance)
(door opens in distance)
(rustling in bushes)
(loud rattling)
(grunting)
Freeze!
Austin?
Hey, aunt Edie.
Anyway...
Mom just got back from her cruise to Jamaica with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
- Ooh.
Needless to say, me and Mr. "can I get you some more hot towels?"-- we didn't exactly hit it off.
So after I broke his nose, I, uh, figured it was a great time to come visit my favorite aunt.
Your mom always did have lousy taste in men.
So, uh, I figured I'd crash here for the night.
Then hitch down to Mexico-- hang out, party.
Yeah, I'm thinking, like, no way in hell.
You're gonna stay here with me until things blow over with your mom, okay?
Cool.
Thanks.
Oh, wait, you're 18, right?
Well, that's what my ID says.
Yeah, mine, too.
Hey, you are supposed to be on bed rest!
I'm bored.
- Well, why don't you try putting on a pair of pants?
That should kill a couple of hours.
(doorbell rings)
Hey, babe.
Hey, what is she doing out of bed?
That can't be good for her.
Or the stairs.
What do you want?
The mediator was right.
A month from now we're not just gonna be Carlos and Gaby.
We're gonna be Mom and Dad, and I don't wanna be at war with the mother of my child, so, here.
Your mamá's pearls?
Carlos... thank you.
And?
And what?
Wouldn't you like to make some reciprocal gesture?
Fine.
You can come to Bree's wedding reception as my guest.
Thanks.
Where is it?
Here.
Here?
You're throwing the... reception?
Yeah, it's our wedding present to Bree.
So I give you a priceless family heirloom, and in return, you invite me to a party at my house that I'm paying for?
Well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?
(scoffs)
Mmm.
Things I'll do for jewelry.
Susan, I am so sorry.
Dr. Mayer?
Panic.
Pure panic.
Here.
These are for ruining our first date.
Shh!
Not in front of Mike!
Oh, look, Mike, Ian brought you flowers.
I'll just go put them in some water.
Look, I-I was just trying to protect Jane's parents.
Oh, please.
- They still haven't accepted the fact that--that Jane isn't going to wake up.
If they knew that we were on a date, that I was trying to move on, well, it would devastate them.
That's a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, is it?
- Excuse me?
A part of you feels that you're cheating on her.
- No!
Well, perhaps a small part, but that--that doesn't mean-- it's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.
That--that's why we should just stop is right now, because it's all way too complicated, and I-I think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
Well, I-I don't think I can do that.
the--the truth is,
I haven't thought of you as just a friend for some time now.
Maybe I shouldn't have let myself feel that way, but--but I have.
And I can't go back.
I'm sorry.
Well, if we can't be friends... then I guess we'll be nothing.
(rap music playing loudly in distance)
(music volume increases)
(rap music continues playing loudly)
(decreases volume)
Hey, leave that alone.
Sorry, I was just... turning it down.
What, you're not a music fan?
Sure, it's just, um...
Got anything where a pimp isn't beating his ho?
(chuckles)
I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.
Oh. (chuckles)
I'm Julie, Susan Mayer's daughter.
Oh.
Anyway, um, I was trying to do my homework, so...
On a Saturday?
Well, make sure and take regular breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.
That's how I like it.
How do you like it?
You know what?
You're not that hot.
Hey, whatcha doing?
Oh, I'm working on a seating chart--mwah!
For Bree's wedding.
Nora?
Who invited her?
I did.
We need to find her another boyfriend, and weddings are crawling with single men.
Hey, I hope you're not seating her next to any of my friends.
- Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom.
No, Jerry Rawlings!
Not Jerry Rawlings!
Yes!
- She gets her psycho hooks into Jerry Rawlings, he will never speak to me again.
Oh, there are other urologists in the world.
Go back to that other guy.
- The one with the cold hands?
Oh, it's once a year.
Suck it up.
- Get a grip, Lynette.
"Get a grip"?
!
I am hanging on for dear life here.
You are the one that brought this little problem into our family,
And the only thing I should be hearing from you is,
"How can I help?"
I am also putting Steve Hanson at her table, so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy.
Get a grip.
(cans rattling)
(chuckles)
Hi.
My name is Susan Mayer.
Your neighbor told me I could find you here.
Yeah?
- Well, I was at my friend Bree's engagement party the other night-- you know, when you came in and you did that whole
"Orson killed his wife" thing?
I was just wondering if you could elaborate.
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?
Look, I can't talk now.
I get off at 6:00.
My friend is marrying that man in two hours.
Please?
Okay, I-I need, um, $10 in unrolled pennies, and I need to see you count it, 'cause last time you stiffed me.
After Alma disappeared, the police came and searched the house.
The police?
What did they find?
Nothing.
And that's bad why?
Don't you get it?
When the police showed up,
Orson had scrubbed every inch of the place clean with bleach.
No fingerprints, no skin cells, no DNA.
It was like Alma had never existed.
Who cleans a house like that unless he has something to hide?
So when I left the bank,
I called the detective that worked the case, and he said that the only reason Orson was never charged, was because they never found the body.
- So he was an actual suspect?
He was the only suspect.
- Oh, my God!
What are we gonna do?
Well, you know what we have to do.
That was close.
The florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet, but not to worry.
Crisis averted.
Bree... we have to talk.
Ah, Reverend.
Any word from the bridal party?
They're still in the bride's room.
You know women.
They're probably in there fussing about mascara and blush.
He did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid!
I said it was a theory.
The point is,
Alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
I don't have time for this.
I'm getting married now.
This is your day.
You can push the ceremony back an hour.
Now get that detective on the phone, talk things out with Orson.
I can't talk to Orson.
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.
If the three of you don't drop this right now,
I will never forgive you.
Bree, we are just doing this because we love you.
But... if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt...
None whatsoever.
Hmm.
(Mendelssohn's "wedding march" playing)
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of god to join this man and woman in holy--
- Excuse me?
Could you give us just a second?
Is something wrong?
- I just need a moment.
(guests murmuring)
Before we do this,
There's something I need to ask you.
- What?
Did you kill your wife?
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.
Why didn't you tell me that the police searched her house?
Because it's embarrassing, and they didn't find anything.
Is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
When I'm upset, I clean.
For God's sake, Bree,
I swear to you I did not kill my wife.
Okay.
Proceed.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of God to join this man and woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate...
Hey!
Look at you, miss popular!
so are you having a good time over there?
As if, and I don't know what idiot stuck me at that table, but every guy over there is just a boring stiff.
All of them?
What about...
Jerry?
Jerry's fun.
You mean Mr. Fatty Hair Plugs?
Oh, yeah, he's a blast.
(imitates gunshot)
Um, how about Steve?
You know what?
I hear his family has money.
Well, then maybe they could all chip in and buy him some deodorant.
I'm through with those losers.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
Are you gonna eat that?
(gasps) Hey, look at you!
(sighs) God, I hate wearing a tux.
On my way in, Bree's aunt fern asked me to park the car.
She's got glaucoma.
To her, you're nothing but a Hispanic blur.
(chuckles)
Let me fix your tie.
Hey, you're wearing mamá's pearls.
Yeah.
Oh!
Hey, Julie!
Have you met my nephew Austin?
Yeah, we've met.
I just didn't recognize him with his shirt on.
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.
Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?
It was.
Perfect.
Well, it's nice to see you two getting along again.
We've sort of turned a corner.
- Really?
Does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
Maybe.
- God, no!
Wow, is that shrimp?
What would make you think
I would even consider taking you back?
Well, you invited me to be your date.
"Guest," Carlos.
I said "guest."
- Come on, you've been flirting with me since I came in--
"Here, baby, let me fix your tie."
I mean, for a woman who's not interested, you sure are sending some mixed signals.
You want a clear signal?
How's this?
(band playing jazz music)
Ian!
- Susan!
What are you doing here?
Well, my--my cousin is--is Dr. Hodges' dental hygienist, and her husband-- he--he couldn't join us since he'd come down with a spot of impetigo, so she called me, knowing how much I love a good garter toss, and so--
Ian.
Yes, I-I'm such a terrible liar.
I mean, impetigo-- where did that come from?
Hmm.
So what are you really doing here?
(sighs) Look...
I can't stop thinking about us, about how great we could be together, and I think you're making a mistake.
Ian-- Susan, please don't go.
Can't we at least talk about this?
I can't, 'cause I have...
bridesmaid stuff.
Hi there.
I just wanted to say you're doing a great job...
Tad. (chuckles)
That's, um, that's such a masculine name.
My boyfriend seems to like it.
Okay, here's the drill.
My ex is here, and I wanna piss him off, so just act like you're all hot for me, and there's a 100 buck tip in it for you.
- Right.
Uh, so should I...
cup your boob?
- No, I'll drive.
(laughing loudly)
Oh!
Tequila, straight.
Hey, are there any decent single women at this wedding?
Not that I've seen.
Ah, damn it.
Not a one.
Hey, Carlos.
You should come over to our table.
That's where all the hotties are.
Hey, everyone!
I'd say it is time that we get Bree and Orson up here for their first dance as a married couple.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I give you Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge!
Orson, you look so serious.
I'm trying to remember my steps.
You're upset, aren't you?
You're still thinking about what I said at the church.
Which part, darling-- the "I do" part, or the "Did you kill your wife?" part?
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.
That's my point.
You had to ask.
(up-tempo jazz music playing)
(squealing)
You are gonna rot in hell for this.
Hey, I just brought two lost souls together.
Okay, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.
he deserves every bit of (singsong voice) "crazy"
she's gonna rain down on him.
Hell... rot... you.
(slow jazz music playing)
What are they doing?
Rounding second and heading for third.
Uh-oh.
Carlos!
Oh, hey, Gaby.
Look, I made a new friend.
Yes, I've been watching you make your new friend, and it's disgusting!
- Do you mind?
We're trying to dance here.
Who the hell are you, anyway, and why the hell are you at this wedding?
!
This is not gonna end well.
They're just two random people who met at a wedding.
Can't pin it on me.
It was her!
Lynette Scavo, I wanna talk to you!
I'll see you at home.
What are you thinking?
I didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
Oh, no, you just wanted me to watch while you sucked the zits off some teenage waiter!
That's it.
I take my invitation back.
You are no longer welcome in my house.
Fine, I'll go!
Just give me back the pearls.
No!
- Gaby.
Carlos, no!
- They were my mamá's!
No!
(gasps)
Now look what you've done!
Mrs. Solis!
No, Carlos!
- Hey, give me that!
Give me those!
- Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Get away!
Those are mine!
No, the hell they are!
Mrs. Solis?
Not now, Xiao-mei!
Mrs. Solis!
Oh, for Goddess' sakes, what?
!
(liquid splashes)
(guests gasp)
(woman) Are you kidding?
I think maybe it's time.
And I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
(rim shot, applause)
Wow.
That was beautiful, aunt fern.
Thank you.
Hey, they mopped up all the amniotic fluid,
So we should feel safe...
Start the conga line!
(piano starts playing) Actually, I'd--I'd like to say a few words.
(piano stops playing)
Bree, Orson, your love is an inspiration to us all.
That's very sweet.
- Hmm.
How do you know him?
I thought he was on your side.
- Mnh-mnh.
Well, I know this is a second wedding for both of you, and I think you're jolly brave.
So often, people find excuses not to fall in love again.
They're--they're afraid.
But it's rare to find somebody that you connect with, so when you do, you have to follow your heart.
Bree, Orson,
I salute you.
all right, let's get the music cranking and the--
Wait, actually, Tom, could you just hang on a second?
Uh, I-I also would like to say a few words.
To Bree and Orson, uh, yes, what could be better than a second love?
And this time you enter into it a little older, little wiser, but also-- and this is key--uh... with a bit of caution.
Because... while love can be spontaneous and wonderful,
it can also be selfish.
And sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away.
uh...
I -- Not you two.
I mean, you two crazy kids are great. (laughs)
Congrats, yeah.
Well, then, let's--
Hang on.
I'd like to respond to that toast.
Bree, Orson, sometimes walking away can seem the best choice.
It's--it's certainly the safest.
But... but what do you do when you find someone who makes you feel joy when you thought you never would again?
Do you-- do you just let them go?
No.
No, I can't do that.
(microphone feedback squeaks) You--you wanna...
No.
I'm good.
All right then, let's dance!
**
Well, I thought you might need a change of clothes.
You're still mad at me, huh?
What were you thinking, setting Carlos up with Skank?
!
I'm sorry.
I was desperate.
I had a little too much to drink.
And you are divorcing Carlos...
No, Lynette, Carlos will never be fair game.
You know the rules.
You're right.
You are right.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
It's just... what?
I'm so unhappy.
Ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives,
I-I can't even work up a smile.
And the more she pushes, the more I resent Tom--
Tom, for something he did 12 years ago.
And I'm afraid if I can't fix... this, that... the anger is just gonna fester until...
Lynette, listen to me--
You and Tom will survive this.
No, seriously, Gaby,
I am so tired of pretending to smile.
You and Tom... will survive this.
Yeah?
How can you be so sure?
Because some marriages were built to last... and some aren't.
Trust me, I know the difference.
(applause)
(both chuckle)
I'm looking for Bree van de Kamp.
Right over there.
Could you excuse me for just a minute?
Mm-hmm.
Orson, congratulations.
Excuse me.
Are you Mrs. van de Kamp?
It's Hodge now.
Yes, I'm terribly sorry to barge in like this, but we need your husband to come down to the morgue.
We may have found his wife's body.
(grunting)
Push, Xiao-mei.
Push.
(groaning)
Okay, okay.
Deep breaths now.
You're getting close.
It's time!
I can't believe this is happening!
I think I'm gonna cry.
Carlos, I am so sorry about the--
Yeah, I--me, too.
Me, too.
I was way out of line.
I forgive you.
It's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
(grunting)
Okay, I can see the head now.
Oh, get the camera!
Get the camera!
(grunting)
Oh!
(Gaby) Oh, my God!
(baby crying)
Oh, man,
I gotta get the color fixed on this thing.
How could this have happened?
What kind of half-ass fertility clinic are you running?
Uh, prior to implantation, our embryo was accidentally switched with another client's.
So if we got theirs and they got ours, then--then it's possible...
No, I'm afraid your embryo didn't take.
Again, on behalf of the clinic, I am so sorry.
It's rare, but these things do happen.
- Excuse me.
You screw up our lives, and the best you can do is,
"That's the way the cookie crumbles"?
!
And who is this guy?
Why is he writing down everything I say?
- This is Mr. Darby, our attorney.
We thought it wise to have him present.
Do you know what else would've been wise?
Sticking the right baby in the right belly!
Mrs. Solis, please.
That's not Alma.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Thank God.
Carolyn.
What is she doing here?
You didn't honestly think they'd take your word for it, did you?
It's not her.
Well, that's it then.
Sorry for wasting your time.
This means nothing.
I'm telling you, that man is as guilty as sin!
We know what you think.
Now would you please leave us alone?
He's a cold-blooded killer.
He's kind and decent, and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again.
Now please go.
You deserve him.
Darling, I am so sorry you had to endure that.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
- All right.
Tu me manques, Monique.
Well...
Yeah.
[Mary Alice] Previously on Desperate Housewives:
It means a lot to her to feel included.
Sometimes dark clouds have silver linings.
He sort of asked me out.
It's OK with you if I go out with him?
Sometimes they don't.
Once that baby comes, I'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone.
When it comes to life on Wisteria Lane...
Will you marry me?
... things that seem too good to be true...
- She know you killed your wife?
- ... usually turn out...
Get away from him now while you can.
... to be deadly.
Brides are sensitive creatures, and no one knows this better than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them.
I think a ten-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice, and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it.
Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.
Sure.
Who doesn't love a string quartet?
But if you got a band, maybe people could dance, as opposed to sway.
But one area where a bridesmaid's tact is most required involves the dress...
So what do you think?
... she's required to wear.
Well...
I'm not sure that I've ever seen this shade of green before.
It'll be gorgeous with my coloring.
- Yes, it would look perfect.
- For someone with your coloring.
It's not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
Then why the rush?
Yeah, I'd have thought of you as a person who wants time to plan.
Well, Orson and I talked about it, and we just feel at our age it's silly to wait.
With your help, we can get it all done.
Well, we are happy to pitch in.
I have to get a copy of the seating chart for you, Gabby.
You are in charge of the centerpieces.
And, Susan, I will think of a job for you.
Here's a job.
Talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist.
We don't know that.
All we have is some crazy woman's accusation.
His wife vanished.
He didn't even tell Bree.
- How much proof do you need?
- He says he's innocent.
She believes him.
If we say we don't, she'll hate us.
I'm sorry.
I cannot sit here on my Key-lime ass and watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life.
[Bree clears throat]
And what mistake would that be?
Well um...
Honestly...
[Mary Alice] Yes, a bridesmaid can question many of the bride's choices...
These dresses are hideous.
... but the groom isn't one of them.
[Mary Alice] The perfect couple.
We've all met them, haven't we?
That man and woman so clearly made for each other, we feel certain they're on the road to happiness.
But that road has many detours.
And even perfect couples can find themselves... at a dead end.
- [Carlos] You want what?
- [Gabby] You heard me.
And I want the bedroom stereo,
I want the marble console, and that painting of St. Augustine.
- You don't even know who he is.
- I know he matches the drapes.
Can we focus?
And my pearl necklace.
I noticed that you swiped it.
That was Mama's, and her mama's.
It belongs in my family.
You thought I belonged in your family, and you got over that.
- Stop eating my fries.
- I'm hungry.
You know what the doctor said.
This man bleeds bacon grease.
Enough.
You have to find a way to deal with each other.
You are about to bring a child into this world and, divorced or not, once that child arrives, you'll be bound together for as long as you live.
Well, in that case, have some more fries.
- [Nora] I'll pick Kayla up Sunday.
- Whenever, go.
You and Turk have a great time.
Trust me, we will.
- The man is a jackhammer.
- Ah.
- Bye, Tom.
See ya Sunday.
- Bye.
Where is she going?
She and Turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
That's Turk?
That's the new boyfriend?
No.
Hey, Tom, please.
I don't want my daughter with a guy like that.
You haven't even met him.
He could be the sweetest man in the world.
[both laughing]
More importantly, since he entered the picture,
Squeaky Fromme is never around.
It has been bliss.
I haven't made this face in a week.
- If you ruin this, I will hurt you.
- Just look at him, please.
That is a child's skull hanging from his rearview mirror.
- Doesn't that concern you?
- No, I'm good.
Could be a monkey.
Uh, I think I will have the mesclun salad.
That's it?
That's all you're having?
- Well, all the food is very expensive.
- You don't need to whisper.
The waiter knows they're robbing us blind.
You can have whatever you want.
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles.
Is that OK?
Fine.
I'll just have Jane moved to the VA hospital.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm kidding.
It's fine.
- I'll have what she's having.
- Of course.
Thank you.
God, I love seeing you laugh.
It's been a long time since I've been in the mood to.
Thank you.
Oh, dear God.
- Did I squeeze too hard?
- No.
It's my wife's parents.
Oh!
Oh, wow.
Is this gonna be awkward?
No, not unless, of course, they see us.
- [man] Ian.
- Awkward.
Jeff.
Renee.
What a delightful surprise.
It's so good to see you, dear.
Hello.
I'm Renee, and this is my husband, Jeff.
- Susan Mayer.
- Doctor.
Dr. Susan Mayer.
She's new to Jane's neurology team.
[Renee] Oh.
I just assumed you worked in Ian's publishing house.
Well, yes, how nice that would have been, huh?
But no, no.
I'm... a brain specialist.
Well, Dr. Mayer, maybe I can ask you.
Our daughter's most recent EEG showed brain spikes, but it didn't change the score on her Glasgow scale.
Why is that?
What an excellent question.
And this is the spinal cord.
And it, of course, attaches to the brain.
You don't have to dumb it down for us.
We've been dealing with Jane's condition for years.
Oh.
Good. [stammers]
- Well, then, let's get technical.
- Let's give Dr. Mayer the night off.
She was in surgery for ten hours today, performing a craniotomy.
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.
How'd it go?
Uh, well, it just...
Wow.
I hear my phone vibrating.
Hello.
Dr. Mayer.
Yeah, what?
You say that his brain shut off?
I'll be right there.
Stat.
I'm sorry.
Duty calls.
Orson, I moved the furniture back.
Good Lord, Bree.
Not again.
[soft music plays]
Don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
There'll be 200 people staring at us.
You know, Bree, since that incident at our engagement party, there's been a lot of dark talk about me.
I don't pay attention to gossip.
I'd understand if you had second thoughts about marrying a man who's under a cloud.
No one who knows you could believe you could hurt a woman.
Strangers may talk, but I know the truth.
Really?
Men have lied to me before.
Believe me, it'll never happen again.
So you trust me completely?
Clearly I do.
The body's unusually well-preserved because it was buried in clay.
- Do we have a cause of death?
- Blunt force trauma to the head.
Pull all the missing persons reports.
Cross-check against her height, age, and weight.
I'm running a DNA panel, since we won't be able to use her dental records.
Why not?
Whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth.
[woman crying]
Nora.
What are you doing back?
Are you OK?
- Shut the door.
- OK.
I don't want Kayla to find me like this.
- What's wrong?
- Turk and I had a fight.
What?
No.
No, no, no.
- What happened?
- What happened is, Turk is an ass.
We stopped off at this bar and I got bitchy with one of the waitresses.
Who cares, right?
I mean, who cares?
It's a bar, and we all do it, right?
Right.
So, he tells me to watch my mouth, and I'm like, whoa, get a load of Mr. Two Strikes trying to tell me how to act in public.
And then he called me a whore.
We're done.
OK, whoa, whoa.
Take a deep breath.
You don't break up with a guy because in a weak moment he calls you a whore.
And then on the way out, he threatened to hit me.
OK, but he didn't, and until he...
Oh, jeez, Lynette.
Whose side are you on?
I'm on the side of love.
You guys seem like such a perfect couple.
- I know.
- I just...
You don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.
[sniffs loudly]
No.
It's over.
I just got off the phone with Turk's parole officer and I was like,
"Guess who ain't in Nevada no more?"
Click.
I think I'm gonna have to stay here tonight.
[rattling, footsteps running]
[Ioud crash]
Freeze!
- Austin?
- Hey, Aunt Edie.
Anyway, Mom just got back from her cruise to Jamaica with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
Needless to say, me and Mr. Can I Get You Some More Hot Towels?
we didn't exactly hit it off.
After I broke his nose, I figured it was time to visit my favorite aunt.
Your mom always did have lousy taste in men.
So, I figured I'd crash here for the night, then hitch down to Mexico, hang out, party.
Yeah.
I'm thinking, like, no way in hell.
Stay here with me until things blow over with your mom, OK?
Cool.
Thanks.
Wait.
You're 18, right?
- Well, that's what my ID says.
- Yeah, mine too.
Hey!
You are supposed to be on bed rest.
I'm bored.
Try putting on a pair of pants.
That should kill a couple of hours.
[doorbell chimes]
Hey, babe.
Hey, what is she doing out of bed?
That can't be good for her.
Or the stairs.
- What do you want?
- The mediator was right.
A month from now, we're not just gonna be Carlos and Gabby, we're gonna be Mom and Dad.
And I don't wanna be at war with the mother of my child.
So, here.
Your mama's pearls.
Carlos.
- Thank you.
- And?
And what?
Wouldn't you like to make some reciprocal gesture?
Fine.
You can come to Bree's wedding reception, as my guest.
- Thanks.
Where is it?
- Here.
Here?
You're throwing the reception?
It's our wedding present to Bree.
I give you a priceless family heirloom, and in return you invite me to a party at my house that I'm paying for?
Well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?
[scoffs]
- Mmm.
- The things I'll do for jewelry.
Susan, I am so sorry.
Dr. Mayer?
Panic.
Pure panic.
Here.
These are for ruining our first date.
Shh!
Not in front of Mike.
Look, Mike, Ian brought you flowers.
I'll just go put them in some water.
Look, I was just trying to protect Jane's parents.
Oh, please...
They haven't accepted the fact that Jane isn't going to wake up.
If they knew we were on a date, that I was trying to move on, well, it would devastate them.
A lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story.
Excuse me?
A part of you feels like you're cheating on her.
No.
Well, perhaps a small part, but that doesn't mean...
It's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.
We should just stop this right now because it's all way too complicated.
I think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
Well, I don't think I can do that.
The truth is, I haven't thought of you as just a friend for some time now.
Maybe I shouldn't have let myself feel that way, but I have.
And I can't go back.
I'm sorry.
Well, if we can't be friends then I guess we'll be nothing.
[muffled rap music]
[rap music louder]
Hey, leave that alone.
Sorry.
I was just turning it down.
- You're not a music fan?
- Sure.
It's just, got anything where a pimp isn't beating his ho?
I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.
Oh.
I'm Julie.
Susan Mayer's daughter.
Oh...
Anyway, I was trying to do my homework, so...
On a Saturday?
Well, make sure and take regular breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.
That's how I like it.
How do you like it?
You know what?
You're not that hot.
[dog barking]
Hey, what you doing?
I'm working on the seating chart for Bree's wedding.
- Nora?
Who invited her?
- I did.
We need to find her another boyfriend.
Weddings are crawling with single men.
You're not seating her next to my friends?
- Sacrifices must be made, Tom.
- Not Jerry Rawlings.
If she gets her psycho hooks into Jerry, he will never speak to me again.
There are other urologists.
Go back to that other guy.
- The one with the cold hands?
- It's once a year.
Suck it up.
Get a grip, Lynette.
Get a grip?
I am hanging on for dear life here.
You are the one that brought this little problem into our family, and the only thing I should be hearing from you is, "How can I help?"
I am also putting Steve Hanson at her table, so you might wanna start shopping around for a new golf buddy.
Get a grip.
[exhales]
[telephone rings]
Hi.
My name's Susan Mayer.
Your neighbor told me I could find you here.
Yeah?
Well, I was at my friend Bree's engagement party, when you came in and you did that whole "Orson killed his wife" thing.
I was wondering if you could elaborate.
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?
Look, I can't talk now.
I get off at six.
My friend is marrying that man in two hours.
Please.
OK, I need ten dollars in unrolled pennies, and I need to see you count it because last time you stiffed me.
[pennies clinking]
After Alma disappeared, the police came and searched the house.
The police?
What did they find?
Nothing.
- And that's bad why?
- Don't you get it?
When the police showed up, Orson had scrubbed every inch clean with bleach.
No fingerprints, no skin cells, no DNA.
It was like Alma had never existed.
Who cleans a house like that unless he has something to hide?
- [organ playing] - [chattering]
When I left the bank, I called the detective that worked the case.
He said that the only reason Orson was never charged was because they never found a body.
- So he was an actual suspect?
- He was the only suspect.
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, you know what we have to do.
That was close.
The florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet, but not to worry, crisis averted.
Bree, we have to talk.
Ah, Reverend.
Any word from the bridal party?
Still in the bride's room.
You know women.
They're probably fussing about mascara and blush.
He did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid.
I said it was a theory.
Alma disappeared under suspicious circumstances.
I don't have time.
I'm getting married.
You can push the ceremony back an hour.
Now, get that detective on the phone.
Talk things out with Orson.
I can't.
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.
If the three of you don't drop this right now, I will never forgive you.
Bree, we are just doing this because we love you.
But if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt...
None whatsoever.
[footsteps approaching] [organ plays Wedding March]
[Reverend] Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of God to join this man and woman in holy...
Excuse me.
Could you give us just a second?
- Is something wrong?
- I just need a moment.
[crowd murmuring]
Before we do this, there's something I need to ask you.
What?
Did you kill your wife?
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.
Why didn't you tell me the police searched your house?
Because it's embarrassing.
And they didn't find anything.
Is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
When I'm upset, I clean.
For God's sake, Bree, I swear to you, I did not kill my wife.
OK.
Proceed.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of God to join this man and woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate... [chatter, laughter]
[whistling, cheering]
Hey.
Look at you, Miss Popular.
So, are you having a good time over there?
As if.
And I don't know what idiot stuck me at that table, but every guy over there is just a boring stiff.
All of them?
What about Jerry?
Jerry's fun.
You mean Mr. Fatty Hair Plugs?
Yeah, he's a blast.
How about Steve?
You know what, I hear his family has money.
Well, then maybe they could all chip in and buy him some deodorant.
I'm through with those losers.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
Are you gonna eat that?
- [gasps] Hey, look at you.
- [sighs] God, I hate wearing a tux.
On my way in, Bree's Aunt Fern asked me to park the car.
She's got glaucoma.
To her, you're nothing but a Hispanic blur.
Let me fix your tie.
Hey, you're wearing Mama's pearls.
Yeah.
Oh...
Hey, Julie.
Have you met my nephew Austin?
Yeah, we've met.
I just didn't recognize him with his shirt on.
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.
- Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?
- It was.
Perfect.
It's nice to see you two getting along again.
- We've sort of turned a corner.
- You're gonna be getting back together?
- God, no.
- Maybe.
Wow, is that shrimp?
What would make you think I'd even consider taking you back?
- You invited me to be your date.
- Guest, Carlos.
I said guest.
You've been flirting with me since I came in. "Baby, let me fix your tie."
You sure are sending some mixed signals.
You want a clear signal?
How's this?
- Ian.
- Susan.
What are you doing here?
Well, my cousin is Dr. Hodge's dental hygienist.
Her husband couldn't join her, since he'd come down with impetigo.
She called me, knowing how much I love a good garter toss...
Ian...
Yes, I'm such a terrible liar.
I mean, impetigo.
Where did that come from?
Hmm.
So, what are you really doing here?
Look, I can't stop thinking about us, about how great we could be together.
- I think you're making a mistake.
- Ian...
Susan, please don't go.
Can't we at least talk about this?
I can't, 'cause I have bridesmaid stuff.
Hi there.
I just wanted to say you're doing a great job...
Tad.
That's such a masculine name.
My boyfriend seems to like it.
OK, here's the drill.
My ex, I wanna piss him off, so act like you're hot for me.
- There's a hundred-buck tip in it.
- Right.
So, should I cup your boob?
No, I'll drive.
[Gabby laughs loudly]
Tequila.
Straight. [sighs]
Hey, are there any decent single women at this wedding?
Not that I've seen.
Damn it, not a one.
Hey, Carlos.
You should come over to our table.
That's where all the hotties are.
Hey, everyone.
I'd say it is time that we get Bree and Orson up here for their first dance as a married couple.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge.
- [applause] - [piano plays]
- Orson, you look so serious.
- I'm trying to remember my steps.
You're upset.
You're still thinking about what I said at the church.
Which part, darling?
The "I do" part or the "Did you kill your wife?" part?
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.
That's my point.
You had to ask.
[up-tempo music] [shouts]
You are gonna rot in hell for this.
Hey, I just brought two lost souls together.
OK, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.
He deserves every bit of crazy she's gonna rain down on him.
Hell, rot, you.
[slower music plays]
What are they doing?
Rounding second and heading for third.
Uh-oh.
- Carlos.
- Hey, Gabby.
Look, I made a new friend.
I've been watching you make your new friend, and it's disgusting.
- Do you mind?
We're trying to dance.
- Who the hell are you, anyway?
And why the hell are you at this wedding?
This is not gonna end well.
They're just two random people who met at a wedding.
They can't pin it on me.
It was her.
Lynette Scavo, I wanna talk to you.
I'll see you at home.
I didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
You just wanted me to watch while you suck the zits off some teenage waiter.
That's it.
I take my invitation back.
You are no longer welcome in my house.
Fine.
I'll go.
Just give me back the pearls.
- No!
- Gabby.
- Carlos, no.
- They were Mama's.
No!
[gasps]
Now look what you've done.
- Mrs. Solis.
- No, Carlos.
Give me those.
- Pardon me, excuse me.
- Get away.
Those are mine.
- The hell they are.
- Mrs. Solis.
- Not now, Xiao Mei.
- Mrs. Solis!
For God's sakes, what?
- [Xiao Mei's water breaks] - [crowd gasps]
I think maybe it's time.
And I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
- [applause]
- Wow.
That was beautiful, Aunt Fern.
Thank you.
Hey, they mopped up all the amniotic fluid, so we should feel safe to start the conga line.
Actually, I'd like to say a few words.
Bree, Orson, your love is an inspiration to us all.
That's very sweet.
How do you know him?
I thought he was on your side.
This is a second wedding for both of you, and I think you're jolly brave.
So often people find excuses not to fall in love again.
They're afraid.
But it's rare to find somebody that you connect with, so you have to follow your heart.
Bree, Orson, I salute you.
Let's get the music cranking, and...
Actually, Tom, could you just hang on a second?
I also would like to say a few words.
To Bree and Orson.
Yes, what could be better than a second love?
And this time, you enter into it a little older, a little wiser.
But also, and this is key, with a bit of caution.
Because while love can be spontaneous and wonderful, it can also be selfish, and sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away.
Uh... not you two.
I mean, you two crazy kids are great.
Congrats.
- Well, then, let's...
- I'd like to respond to that toast.
Bree, Orson, sometimes walking away can seem the best choice, it's certainly the safest, but what do you do when you find someone who makes you feel joy when you thought you never would again?
Do you just let them go?
No.
No, I can't do that.
You wanna...?
No.
I'm good.
All right, then, let's dance.
[band plays up-tempo music]
Well, I thought you might need a change of clothes.
- Yeah, you're still mad at me, huh?
- What were you thinking?
- Setting Carlos up with that skank.
- I am sorry.
I was desperate.
I had a little too much to drink.
And you are divorcing Carlos.
No, Lynette, Carlos will never be fair game.
You know the rules.
You're right.
You are right.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
It's just...
What?
I'm so unhappy.
Ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives,
I can't even work up a smile.
And the more she pushes, the more I resent Tom.
Tom, for something he did 12 years ago.
And I'm afraid if I can't fix this that the anger's just gonna fester, until...
Lynette, listen to me.
You and Tom will survive this.
No, seriously, Gabby.
I am so tired of pretending to smile.
You and Tom will survive this.
Yeah?
How can you be so sure?
Because some marriages were built to last.
And some aren't.
Trust me, I know the difference.
- [chatter] - [applause]
I'm looking for Bree Van de Kamp.
Could you excuse me for just a minute?
Orson, congratulations.
Excuse me.
Are you Mrs. Van de Kamp?
It's Hodge now.
Yes, I'm terribly sorry to barge in like this, but we need your husband to come down to the morgue.
We may have found his wife's body.
[groans loudly, then pants]
Push, Xiao Mei, push.
OK, OK.
Deep breaths now.
We're getting close.
It's time.
I can't believe this is happening.
Honey, I'm gonna cry.
- Carlos, I am so sorry about the...
- Me too, me too.
- I was way out of line.
- I forgive you.
It's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
[screams]
- OK, I can see the head now.
- Get the camera.
Get the camera.
- Oh, my God.
- [baby cries]
Man, I gotta get the color fixed on this thing.
What kind of half-assed fertility clinic are you running?
Prior to implantation, your embryo was switched with another client's.
So if we got theirs and they got ours, then it's possible...
I'm afraid your embryo didn't take.
Again, on behalf of the clinic, I am so sorry.
- It's rare, but things do happen.
- [Gabby] Excuse me.
You screw up our lives and the best you can do is,
"That's the way the cookie crumbles"?
Why is this guy writing down everything I say?
Mr. Darby, our attorney.
We thought it wise to have him present.
Know what else would've been wise?
Sticking the right baby in the right belly.
Mrs. Solis, please...
- That's not Alma.
- [exhales deeply]
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
Thank God.
Carolyn.
What is she doing here?
You didn't honestly think they'd take your word for it, did you?
It's not her.
Well, that's it, then.
Sorry for wasting your time.
This means nothing.
I'm telling you, that man is as guilty as sin.
We know what you think.
Now, would you please leave us alone?
He's a cold-blooded killer.
He's kind and decent, and nothing you could say will make me doubt him again.
Now, please go.
- You deserve him.
- I hope to.
Darling, I am so sorry you had to endure that.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Let's just go back to our guests and forget this ever happened.
All right.
Tu me manques, Monique.
Well...
Yeah.
I feel so...
Me, too.
Well, you know what the good news is?
What's that?
Now that there's no baby, it'll make the divorce a lot simpler.
Yeah, that's something.
So...
See you at the mediator's.
See you then.
[Mary Alice] Have you met the perfect couple?
The two soul mates whose love never dies?
The two lovers whose relationship is never threatened?
The husband and wife who trust each other completely?
If you haven't met the perfect couple, let me introduce you.
They stand atop a layer of butter cream frosting.
The secret of their success?
Well, for starters, they don't have to look at each other.
Previously on Desperate Housewives:
It means a lot to her to feel included.
Sometimes dark clouds have silver linings...
He sort of asked me out.
It's okay with you if I go out with him?
- sometimes they don't.
Once that baby comes, I'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone.
- when it comes to life on Wisteria Lane...
Will you marry me?
Things that seem too good to be true...
Does she know you killed your wife?
- usually turn out...
Get away from him now while you can.
to be deadly.
Desperate Housewives - season 3 episode 2 "It Takes Two"
Brides are sensitive creatures, and no one knows this better than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them.
Well, I think a 10-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice, and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it.
Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.
Uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet?
But if you got a band, maybe people could dance, as opposed to sway.
But the one area where a bridesmaid's tact is most required involves the dress...
So what do you think?
she's required to wear.
Well, um...
I'm not sure that I've ever seen this shade of green before.
Yeah, don't you think it'll be gorgeous with my coloring?
Yes, it would look perfect.
For someone with your coloring.
I mean, I was lucky to find these-- not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
Then why the rush?
Yeah, Bree, I'd have thought of you as a person who wants time to plan.
Well, Orson and I talked about it, and we just feel, at our age -- it's silly to wait.
And with your help, I'm sure we can get it all done.
- Well, we are happy...
Oh, uh, that reminds me.
I have to get a copy of the seating chart for you.
Gaby, you are in charge of the centerpieces.
And don't worry, Susan.
I will think of a job for you.
Here's a job.
How about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
Susan, we don't know that!
All we have is some crazy woman's accusations.
His wife vanished, and he didn't even tell Bree.
How much more proof do you need?
He says he's innocent.
She believes him.
If we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us.
Well, I'm sorry.
I cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life!
ahem!
And what mistake would that be?
Well... um... honestly... yes, a bridesmaid can question many of the bride's choices.
These dresses are hideous.
but the groom isn't one of them.
**
the perfect couple... we've all met them, haven't we?
that man and woman so clearly made for each other, we feel certain they're on the road to happiness.
but that road has many detours, and even perfect couples can find themselves... at a dead end.
you want what?
!
You heard me.
And I want the bedroom stereo.
I want the marble console and that painting of St. Augustine.
You don't even know who he is.
I know he matches the drapes.
- People, can we focus here?
And I want my pearl necklace back.
Don't think I didn't notice that you swiped it.
- That was my Mamá's
I think it belongs in my family.
- There was a time
I belonged in your family, and you got over that.
Stop eating my fries!
- I'm hungry.
You know what the doctor said.
You should see his cholesterol.
This man bleeds baking grease.
- Enough!
You two are gonna have to find a way to deal with each other, because you are about to bring a child into this world.
And divorced or not, once that child arrives, you will be bound together for as long as you live.
Well, in that case...
Have some more fries.
I'll pick Kayla up on Sunday.
Whenever.
Just go.
You and Turk have a great time.
Oh, trust me, we will.
The man is a jackhammer.
- Ah.
Bye, Tom.
Bye.
See you Sunday!
Where is she goin'?
She and Turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
That's Turk?
That's the new boyfriend?
Unh-unh, no.
Hey, hey, hey, Tom, please.
I don't want my daughter hanging around with a guy like that.
You haven't even met him.
He could be the sweetest man in the world.
Ha ha!
Ooh.
More importantly, ever since he entered the picture, squeaky Fromme is never around.
It has been bliss.
I haven't made this face...
in a week.
If you ruin this, so help me, I will hurt you.
Just look at him.
look at him, please.
I swear, that is a child's skull hanging from his rearview mirror.
Doesn't that concern you?
No, I'm good.
Could be a monkey.
Uh, I think I will have the...
Mesclun salad.
That's it?
That's all you're having?
well, all the food is very expensive.
You don't need to whisper.
The waiter knows they're robbing us blind.
You can have whatever you want.
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll just have Jane moved to the V.A. hospital.
- Oh, my god.
I'm kidding.
It's fine.
I'll have what she's having.
Of course.
Thank you.
God, I love seeing you laugh.
Oh, well, it's been a long time since I've been in the mood to.
- Thank you.
Oh, dear god!
Did I squeeze too hard?
No, it's my wife's parents.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Oh, is this gonna be awkward?
No, no, no, not unless, of course, they see us.
Ian?
- Awkward.
Jeff, Renee, what a delightful surprise.
It's so good to see you, dear.
Hello.
I'm Renee, and this my husband Jeff.
Susan Mayer.
Uh, doctor...
Dr. Susan Mayer--she's new To Jane's neurology team.
Oh!
I just assumed you worked In Ian's publishing house.
Well, yes, and how--how nice that would've been, huh?
Um, but, no, no, I'm a... a brain specialist.
Well, Dr. Mayer, maybe I can ask you, our daughter's most recent E.E.G. showed brain spikes, but it didn't change the score on the Glasgow scale.
Why is that?
What an excellent question.
And this is the, uh... spinal cord.
- Uh-huh.
And it, of course, attaches to the brain.
You don't have to dumb it down for us, doctor.
We've been dealing with Jane's condition for years.
Oh, good.
Um, well, then let's--let's get technical.
Uh, let's give Dr. Mayer the night off.
She was in surgery for ten hours today performing a craniotomy.
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.
How'd it go?
Uh, well, it just--
Wow!
I hear my-- my phone vibrating.
Um, hello, uh, Dr. Mayer.
Yeah, what?
You say that his brain shut off?
Oh, well, I'll be right there.
Um, stat.
I'm sorry.
duty calls.
Orson?
I moved the furniture back!
Good lord, Bree, not again.
Don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
There'll be 200 people staring at us.
You know, Bree... since that incident at our engagement party, there's been a lot of dark talk about me.
Well, I don't pay attention to gossip.
I'm just saying I would understand if you had second thoughts about marrying a man who's under a cloud.
Well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman.
Strangers may talk, but I know the truth.
Really?
Men have lied to me before.
Believe me, that'll never happen again.
So you trust me completely?
Clearly, I do.
The body is unusually well-preserved because it was buried in clay.
Do we have a cause of death?
Blunt force trauma to the head.
I want you to pull all the missing persons reports, cross-check against her height, age and weight.
I'm also running a DNA panel since we won't be able to use her dental records.
Why not?
Whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth.
Nora?
What are you doing back?
Are you okay?
Shut the door!
Okay.
I don't want Kayla to find me like this.
What's wrong?
Turk and I had a fight.
What?
No!
No, no, no!
What happened?
What happened is, Turk is an ass!
On the way to the river, we stopped off at this bar.
And we were playing pool, and I got a little bitchy with one of the waitresses.
Who cares, right?
I mean, who cares?
It's a bar, and we all do it, right?
- R-right.
So he tells me to watch my mouth.
And I'm like, whoa!
Get a load of Mr. Two Strikes trying to tell me how to act in public.
And then he called me a whore.
We're done.
Okay, whoa!
Whoa!
Take a deep breath.
You don't break up with a guy because in a weak moment he calls you a whore.
And then on the way out, he threatened to hit me.
Okay, but he didn't.
He didn't.
And, you know, until--
Oh, jeez, Lynette, whose side are you on?
!
I'm on the side of love.
You guys seem like such a perfect couple.
I know.
I just--I-I...
You know, you don't wanna Throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.
No. it's over.
I just got off the phone with Turk's parole officer, and I was like, "guess who ain't in Nevada no more?" Click.
I think I'm gonna have to stay here tonight.
Freeze!
Austin?
Hey, aunt Edie.
Anyway...
Mom just got back from her cruise to Jamaica with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
- Ooh.
Needless to say, me and Mr. "can I get you some more hot towels?"-- we didn't exactly hit it off.
So after I broke his nose, I, uh, figured it was a great time to come visit my favorite aunt.
Your mom always did have lousy taste in men.
So, uh, I figured I'd crash here for the night.
Then hitch down to Mexico-- hang out, party.
Yeah, I'm thinking, like, no way in hell.
You're gonna stay here with me until things blow over with your mom, okay?
Cool.
Thanks.
Oh, wait, you're 18, right?
Well, that's what my ID says.
Yeah, mine, too.
Hey, you are supposed to be on bed rest!
I'm bored.
- Well, why don't you try putting on a pair of pants?
That should kill a couple of hours.
Hey, babe.
Hey, what is she doing out of bed?
That can't be good for her.
Or the stairs.
What do you want?
The mediator was right.
A month from now we're not just gonna be Carlos and Gaby.
We're gonna be Mom and Dad, and I don't wanna be at war with the mother of my child, so, here.
Your mamá's pearls?
Carlos... thank you.
And?
And what?
Wouldn't you like to make some reciprocal gesture?
Fine.
You can come to Bree's wedding reception as my guest.
Thanks.
Where is it?
Here.
Here?
You're throwing the... reception?
Yeah, it's our wedding present to Bree.
So I give you a priceless family heirloom, and in return, you invite me to a party at my house that I'm paying for?
Well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind? Mmm.
Things I'll do for jewelry.
Susan, I am so sorry.
Dr. Mayer?
Panic.
Pure panic.
Here.
These are for ruining our first date.
Shh!
Not in front of Mike!
Oh, look, Mike, Ian brought you flowers.
I'll just go put them in some water.
Look, I-I was just trying to protect Jane's parents.
Oh, please.
- They still haven't accepted the fact that--that Jane isn't going to wake up.
If they knew that we were on a date, that I was trying to move on, well, it would devastate them.
That's a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, is it?
- Excuse me?
A part of you feels that you're cheating on her.
- No!
Well, perhaps a small part, but that--that doesn't mean-- it's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.
That--that's why we should just stop is right now, because it's all way too complicated, and I-I think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
Well, I-I don't think I can do that.
the--the truth is,
I haven't thought of you as just a friend for some time now.
Maybe I shouldn't have let myself feel that way, but--but I have.
And I can't go back.
I'm sorry.
Well, if we can't be friends... then I guess we'll be nothing.
Hey, leave that alone.
Sorry, I was just... turning it down.
What, you're not a music fan?
Sure, it's just, um...
Got anything where a pimp isn't beating his ho? I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.
Oh.
I'm Julie, Susan Mayer's daughter.
Oh.
Anyway, um, I was trying to do my homework, so...
On a Saturday?
Well, make sure and take regular breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.
That's how I like it.
How do you like it?
You know what?
You're not that hot.
Hey, whatcha doing?
Oh, I'm working on a seating chart--mwah!
For Bree's wedding.
Nora?
Who invited her?
I did.
We need to find her another boyfriend, and weddings are crawling with single men.
Hey, I hope you're not seating her next to any of my friends.
- Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom.
No, Jerry Rawlings!
Not Jerry Rawlings!
Yes!
- She gets her psycho hooks into Jerry Rawlings, he will never speak to me again.
Oh, there are other urologists in the world.
Go back to that other guy.
- The one with the cold hands?
Oh, it's once a year.
Suck it up.
- Get a grip, Lynette.
"Get a grip"?
!
I am hanging on for dear life here.
You are the one that brought this little problem into our family,
And the only thing I should be hearing from you is,
"How can I help?"
I am also putting Steve Hanson at her table, so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy.
Get a grip.
Hi.
My name is Susan Mayer.
Your neighbor told me I could find you here.
Yeah?
- Well, I was at my friend Bree's engagement party the other night-- you know, when you came in and you did that whole
"Orson killed his wife" thing?
I was just wondering if you could elaborate.
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?
Look, I can't talk now.
I get off at 6:00.
My friend is marrying that man in two hours.
Please?
Okay, I-I need, um, $10 in unrolled pennies, and I need to see you count it, 'cause last time you stiffed me.
After Alma disappeared, the police came and searched the house.
The police?
What did they find?
Nothing.
And that's bad why?
Don't you get it?
When the police showed up,
Orson had scrubbed every inch of the place clean with bleach.
No fingerprints, no skin cells, no DNA.
It was like Alma had never existed.
Who cleans a house like that unless he has something to hide?
So when I left the bank,
I called the detective that worked the case, and he said that the only reason Orson was never charged, was because they never found the body.
- So he was an actual suspect?
He was the only suspect.
- Oh, my God!
What are we gonna do?
Well, you know what we have to do.
That was close.
The florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet, but not to worry.
Crisis averted.
Bree... we have to talk.
Ah, Reverend.
Any word from the bridal party?
They're still in the bride's room.
You know women.
They're probably in there fussing about mascara and blush.
He did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid!
I said it was a theory.
The point is,
Alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
I don't have time for this.
I'm getting married now.
This is your day.
You can push the ceremony back an hour.
Now get that detective on the phone, talk things out with Orson.
I can't talk to Orson.
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.
If the three of you don't drop this right now,
I will never forgive you.
Bree, we are just doing this because we love you.
But... if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt...
None whatsoever.
Hmm.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of god to join this man and woman in holy--
- Excuse me?
Could you give us just a second?
Is something wrong?
- I just need a moment.
Before we do this,
There's something I need to ask you.
- What?
Did you kill your wife?
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.
Why didn't you tell me that the police searched her house?
Because it's embarrassing, and they didn't find anything.
Is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
When I'm upset, I clean.
For God's sake, Bree,
I swear to you I did not kill my wife.
Okay.
Proceed.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of God to join this man and woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate...
Hey!
Look at you, miss popular!
so are you having a good time over there?
As if, and I don't know what idiot stuck me at that table, but every guy over there is just a boring stiff.
All of them?
What about...
Jerry?
Jerry's fun.
You mean Mr. Fatty Hair Plugs?
Oh, yeah, he's a blast.
Um, how about Steve?
You know what?
I hear his family has money.
Well, then maybe they could all chip in and buy him some deodorant.
I'm through with those losers.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
Are you gonna eat that?
Hey, look at you!
God, I hate wearing a tux.
On my way in, Bree's aunt fern asked me to park the car.
She's got glaucoma.
To her, you're nothing but a Hispanic blur.
Let me fix your tie.
Hey, you're wearing mamá's pearls.
Yeah.
Oh!
Hey, Julie!
Have you met my nephew Austin?
Yeah, we've met.
I just didn't recognize him with his shirt on.
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.
Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?
It was.
Perfect.
Well, it's nice to see you two getting along again.
We've sort of turned a corner.
- Really?
Does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
Maybe.
- God, no!
Wow, is that shrimp?
What would make you think
I would even consider taking you back?
Well, you invited me to be your date.
"Guest," Carlos.
I said "guest."
- Come on, you've been flirting with me since I came in--
"Here, baby, let me fix your tie."
I mean, for a woman who's not interested, you sure are sending some mixed signals.
You want a clear signal?
How's this? Ian!
- Susan!
What are you doing here?
Well, my--my cousin is--is Dr. Hodges' dental hygienist, and her husband-- he--he couldn't join us since he'd come down with a spot of impetigo, so she called me, knowing how much I love a good garter toss, and so--
Ian.
Yes, I-I'm such a terrible liar.
I mean, impetigo-- where did that come from?
Hmm.
So what are you really doing here?
Look...
I can't stop thinking about us, about how great we could be together, and I think you're making a mistake.
Ian-- Susan, please don't go.
Can't we at least talk about this?
I can't, 'cause I have...
bridesmaid stuff.
Hi there.
I just wanted to say you're doing a great job...
Tad.
That's, um, that's such a masculine name.
My boyfriend seems to like it.
Okay, here's the drill.
My ex is here, and I wanna piss him off, so just act like you're all hot for me, and there's a 100 buck tip in it for you.
- Right.
Uh, so should I...
cup your boob?
- No, I'll drive.
Oh!
Tequila, straight.
Hey, are there any decent single women at this wedding?
Not that I've seen.
Ah, damn it.
Not a one.
Hey, Carlos.
You should come over to our table.
That's where all the hotties are.
Hey, everyone!
I'd say it is time that we get Bree and Orson up here for their first dance as a married couple.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I give you Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge!
Orson, you look so serious.
I'm trying to remember my steps.
You're upset, aren't you?
You're still thinking about what I said at the church.
Which part, darling-- the "I do" part, or the "Did you kill your wife?" part?
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.
That's my point.
You had to ask.
You are gonna rot in hell for this.
Hey, I just brought two lost souls together.
Okay, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.
he deserves every bit of "crazy"
she's gonna rain down on him.
Hell... rot... you.
What are they doing?
Rounding second and heading for third.
Uh-oh.
Carlos!
Oh, hey, Gaby.
Look, I made a new friend.
Yes, I've been watching you make your new friend, and it's disgusting!
- Do you mind?
We're trying to dance here.
Who the hell are you, anyway, and why the hell are you at this wedding?
!
This is not gonna end well.
They're just two random people who met at a wedding.
Can't pin it on me.
It was her!
Lynette Scavo, I wanna talk to you!
I'll see you at home.
What are you thinking?
I didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
Oh, no, you just wanted me to watch while you sucked the zits off some teenage waiter!
That's it.
I take my invitation back.
You are no longer welcome in my house.
Fine, I'll go!
Just give me back the pearls.
No!
- Gaby.
Carlos, no!
- They were my mamá's!
No!
Now look what you've done!
Mrs. Solis!
No, Carlos!
- Hey, give me that!
Give me those!
- Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Get away!
Those are mine!
No, the hell they are!
Mrs. Solis?
Not now, Xiao-mei!
Mrs. Solis!
Oh, for Goddess' sakes, what?
! Are you kidding?
I think maybe it's time.
And I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
Wow.
That was beautiful, aunt fern.
Thank you.
Hey, they mopped up all the amniotic fluid,
So we should feel safe...
Start the conga line!
Actually, I'd--I'd like to say a few words.
Bree, Orson, your love is an inspiration to us all.
That's very sweet.
- Hmm.
How do you know him?
I thought he was on your side.
- Mnh-mnh.
Well, I know this is a second wedding for both of you, and I think you're jolly brave.
So often, people find excuses not to fall in love again.
They're--they're afraid.
But it's rare to find somebody that you connect with, so when you do, you have to follow your heart.
Bree, Orson,
I salute you.
all right, let's get the music cranking and the--
Wait, actually, Tom, could you just hang on a second?
Uh, I-I also would like to say a few words.
To Bree and Orson, uh, yes, what could be better than a second love?
And this time you enter into it a little older, little wiser, but also-- and this is key--uh... with a bit of caution.
Because... while love can be spontaneous and wonderful,
it can also be selfish.
And sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away.
uh...
I -- Not you two.
I mean, you two crazy kids are great.
Congrats, yeah.
Well, then, let's--
Hang on.
I'd like to respond to that toast.
Bree, Orson, sometimes walking away can seem the best choice.
It's--it's certainly the safest.
But... but what do you do when you find someone who makes you feel joy when you thought you never would again?
Do you-- do you just let them go?
No.
No, I can't do that.
You--you wanna...
No.
I'm good.
All right then, let's dance!
**
Well, I thought you might need a change of clothes.
You're still mad at me, huh?
What were you thinking, setting Carlos up with Skank?
!
I'm sorry.
I was desperate.
I had a little too much to drink.
And you are divorcing Carlos...
No, Lynette, Carlos will never be fair game.
You know the rules.
You're right.
You are right.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
It's just... what?
I'm so unhappy.
Ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives,
I-I can't even work up a smile.
And the more she pushes, the more I resent Tom--
Tom, for something he did 12 years ago.
And I'm afraid if I can't fix... this, that... the anger is just gonna fester until...
Lynette, listen to me--
You and Tom will survive this.
No, seriously, Gaby,
I am so tired of pretending to smile.
You and Tom... will survive this.
Yeah?
How can you be so sure?
Because some marriages were built to last... and some aren't.
Trust me, I know the difference.
I'm looking for Bree van de Kamp.
Right over there.
Could you excuse me for just a minute?
Mm-hmm.
Orson, congratulations.
Excuse me.
Are you Mrs. van de Kamp?
It's Hodge now.
Yes, I'm terribly sorry to barge in like this, but we need your husband to come down to the morgue.
We may have found his wife's body.
Push, Xiao-mei.
Push.
Okay, okay.
Deep breaths now.
You're getting close.
It's time!
I can't believe this is happening!
I think I'm gonna cry.
Carlos, I am so sorry about the--
Yeah, I--me, too.
Me, too.
I was way out of line.
I forgive you.
It's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
Okay, I can see the head now.
Oh, get the camera!
Get the camera! Oh!
Oh, my God! Oh, man,
I gotta get the color fixed on this thing.
How could this have happened?
What kind of half-ass fertility clinic are you running?
Uh, prior to implantation, our embryo was accidentally switched with another client's.
So if we got theirs and they got ours, then--then it's possible...
No, I'm afraid your embryo didn't take.
Again, on behalf of the clinic, I am so sorry.
It's rare, but these things do happen.
- Excuse me.
You screw up our lives, and the best you can do is,
"That's the way the cookie crumbles"?
!
And who is this guy?
Why is he writing down everything I say?
- This is Mr. Darby, our attorney.
We thought it wise to have him present.
Do you know what else would've been wise?
Sticking the right baby in the right belly!
Mrs. Solis, please.
That's not Alma.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Thank God.
Carolyn.
What is she doing here?
You didn't honestly think they'd take your word for it, did you?
It's not her.
Well, that's it then.
Sorry for wasting your time.
This means nothing.
I'm telling you, that man is as guilty as sin!
We know what you think.
Now would you please leave us alone?
He's a cold-blooded killer.
He's kind and decent, and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again.
Now please go.
You deserve him.
Darling, I am so sorry you had to endure that.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
- All right.
Tu me manques, Monique.
Well...
Yeah.
Previously on Desperate Housewives... it means a lot to her to feel included.
sometimes dark clouds have silver linings... (susan) he sort of asked me out.
it's okay with you if i go out with him?
sometimes they don't.
once that baby comes, i'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone.
when it comes to life on wisteria lane... will you marry me?
things that seem too good to be true... does she know you killed your wife?
usually turn out... get away from him now while you can.
to be deadly.
(mary alice) brides are sensitive creatures, and no one knows this better than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them.
well, i think a 10-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice, and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it.
personally, i love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.
uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet?
but if you got a band, maybe people could dance, as opposed to sway.
but the one area where a bridesmaid's tact is most required involves the dress... so what do you think?
shshe's required to wear.
well, um... i'm not sure that i've ever seen this shade of green before.
yeah, don't you think it'll be gorgeous with my coloring?
yes, it would look perfect.
for someone with your coloring.
i mean, i was cky to find these-- not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
then why the rush?
yeah, bree, i'd have thought of you as a person who wants time to plan.
well, orson and i talked about it, and we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait.
and with your help, i'm sure we can get it all done.
well, we are happy oh, uh, that reminds me.
i have to get a copy of the seating chart for you.
gaby, you are in charge of the centerpieces.
and don't worry, susan.
i will thinkf a job for you.
here's a job. how about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
susan, we don't know that!
all we have is some crazy woman's accusations.
his wife vanished, and he didn't even tell bree.
how much more proof do you need?
he says he's innocent.
she believes him.
if we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us.
well, i'm sorry. i cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch bree make the worst mistake of her life!
(bree) ahem!
and what mistake would that be?
well... um... honestly... yes, a bridesmaid can question many of the bride's choices.
these dresses are hideous.
but the groom isn't one of them.

the perfect couple... we've all met them, haven't we?
that man and woman so clearly made for each other, we feel certain they're on the road to happiness.
but that road has many detours, and even perfect couples can find themselves... at a dead end.
(carlos) you want what?
!
you heard me.
and i want the bedroom stereo.
i want the marble console and that painting of st. augustine.
you don't even know who he is.
i know he matches the drapes.
people, can we focus here?
and i want my pearl necklace back.
don't think i didn't notice that you swiped it.
that was my mamEs i think it belongs in my family.
there was a time i belonged in your family, and you got over that.
stop eating my fries!
i'm hungry.
you know what the doctor said.
you should see his cholesterol.
this man bleeds baking grease.
enough!
you two are gonna have to find a way to deal with each other, because you are about to bring a child into this world.
and divorced or not, once that child arrives, you will be bound together for as long as you live.
well, in that case... have some more fries.
i'll pick kayla up on sunday.
whenever. just go.
you and turk have a great time.
oh, trust me, we will.
the man is a jackhammer.
ah.
bye, tom.
bye.
see you sunday!
where is she goin'?
she and turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
that's turk?
that's the new boyfriend?
unh-unh, no.
hey, hey, hey, tom, please.
i don't want my daughter hanging around with a guy like that.
you haven't even met him.
he could be the sweetest man in the world.
(squeals) ha ha!
ooh.
more importantly, ever since he entered the picture, squeaky fromme is never around.
it has been bliss.
i haven't made this face...
in a week.
if you ruin this, so help me, i will hurt you.
just look at him.
look at him, please.
i swear, that is a child's skull hanging from his rearview mirror.
doesn't that concern you?
no, i'm good.
could be a monkey.
uh, i think i will have the... mesclun salad.
that's it?
that's all you're having?
(whispering) well, all the food is very expensive.
you don't need to whisper.
the waiter knows they're robbing us blind.
you can have whatever you want.
in that case, i'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles.
is that okay?
yeah, that's fine.
i'll just have jane moved to the v.a. hospital.
oh, my god.
i'm kidding. it's fine.
i'll have what she's having.
of course. thank you.
god, i love seeing you laugh.
oh, well, it's been a long time since i've been in the mood to.
thank you.
oh, dear god!
did i squeeze too hard?
no, it's my wife's parents.
oh!
oh, wow!
oh, is this gonna be awkward?
no, no, no, not unless, of course, they see us.
(man) ian?
awkward.
jeff, renee, what a delightful surprise.
(chuckles) it's so good to see you, dear.
hello. i'm renee, and this my husband jeff.
susan mayer.
uh, doctor... dr. susan mayer--she's new to jane's neurology team.
oh!
i just assumed you worked in ian's publishing house.
well, yes, and how--w nice that would've been, huh?
um, but, no, no, i'm a... a brain specialist.
well, dr. mayer, maybe i can ask you, our daughter's most recent e.e.g. showed brain spikes, but it didn't change the score on the glasgow scale.
why is that?
what an excellent question.
and this is the, uh... spinal cord.
uh-huh.
and it, of course, attaches to the brain.
you don't have to dumb it down for us, doctor.
we've been dealing with jane's condition for years.
oh, good. um, well, then let's--let's get technical.
uh, let's give dr. mayer the night off.
she was in surgery for ten hours today performing a craniotomy.
that's exactly the procedure jane had. how'd it go?
uh, well, it just-- wow!
i hear my-- my phone vibrating.
um, hello, uh, dr. mayer.
yeah, what?
you say that his brain shut off?
oh, well, i'll be right there.
um, stat. i'm sorry.
(chuckles nervously) duty calls.
orson?
i moved the furniture back!
good lord, bree, not again.
(jazz music playing) don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
there'll be 200 people staring at us.
you know, bree... since that incident at our engagement party, there's been a lot of dark talk about me.
well, i don't pay attention to gossip.
i'm just saying i would understand if you had second thoughts about marrying a man who's under a cloud.
well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman.
strangers may talk, but i know the truth.
really?
men have lied to me before.
believe me, that'll never happen again.
so you trust me completely?
clearly, i do.
the body is unusually well-preserved because it was buried in clay.
do we have a cause of death?
blunt force trauma to the head.
i want you to pull all the missing persons reports, cross-check against her height, age and weight.
i'm also running a d.n.a. panel since we won't be able to use her dental records.
why not?
whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth.
nora?
what are you doing back?
are you okay?
shut the door!
okay.
i don't want kayla to find me like this.
what's wrong?
turk and i had a fight.
what?
no!
no, no, no!
what happened?
what happened is, turk is an ass!
on the way to the river, we stopped off at this bar.
and we were aying pool, and i got a little bitchy with one of the waitresses.
who cares, right?
i mean, who cares?
it's a bar, and we all do it, right?
r-right.
so he tells me to watch my mouth.
and i'm like, whoa!
get a load of mr. two strikes trying to tell me how to act in public.
and then he called me a whore.
we're done.
okay, whoa!
whoa!
take a deep breath.
you don't break up with a guy because in a weak moment he calls you a whore.
and then on the way out, he threatened to hit me.
okay, but he didn't. he didn't.
and, you know, until-- oh, jeez, lynette, whose side are you on?
!
i'm on the side of love.
you guys seem like such a perfect couple.
i know.
i just--i-i... you know, you don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.
(sniffles loudly) no. it's over.
i just got off the phone with turk's parole officer, and i was like, "guess who ain't in nevada no more?" click.
(sobbing)
i think i'm gonna have to stay here tonight.
(rattling in distance)
(door opens in distance)
(rustling in bushes)
(loud rattling)
(grunting)
freeze!
austin?
hey, aunt edie.
anyway... mom just got back from her cruise to jamaica with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
ooh.
needless to say, me and mr. "can i get you some more hot towels?"-- we didn't exactly hit it off.
so after i broke his nose, i, uh, figured it was a great time to come visit my favorite aunt.
your mom always did have lousy taste in men.
so, uh, i figured i'd crash here for the night.
then hitch down to mexico-- hang out, party.
yeah, i'm thinking, like, no way in hell.
you're gonna stay here with me until things blow over with your mom, okay?
cool. thanks.
oh, wait, you're 18, right?
well, that's what my i.d. says.
yeah, mine, too.
hey, you are supposed to be on bed rest!
i'm bored.
well, why don't you try putting on a pair of pants?
that should kill a couple of hours.
(doorbell rings)
hey, babe.
hey, what is she doing out of bed?
that can't be good for her.
or the stairs.
what do you want?
the mediator was right.
a month from now we're not just gonna be carlos and gaby.
we're gonna be mom and dad, and i don't wanna be at war with the mother of my child, so, here.
your mamEs pearls?
carlos... thank you.
and?
and what?
wouldn't you like to make some reciprocal gesture?
fine. you can come to bree's wedding reception as my guest.
thanks. where is it?
here.
here?
you're throwing the... reception?
yeah, it's our wedding present to bree.
so i give you a priceless family heirloom, and in return, you invite me to a party at my house that i'm paying for?
well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?
(scoffs) mmm.
things i'll do for jewelry.
susan, i am so sorry.
dr. mayer?
panic. pure panic.
here. these are for ruining our first date.
shh!
not in front of mike!
oh, look, mike, ian brought you flowers.
i'll just go put them in some water.
look, i-i was just trying to protect jane's parents.
oh, please.
they still haven't accepted the fact that--that jane isn't going to wake up.
if they knew that we were on a date, that i was trying to move on, well, it would devastate them.
that's a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, is it?
excuse me?
a part of you feels that you're cheating on her.
no!
well, perhaps a small part, but that--that doesn't mean-- it's all right, 'cause i feel guilty, too.
that--that's why we should just stop is right now, because it's all way too complicated, and i-i think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
well, i-i don't think i can do that.
the--the truth is, i haven't thought of you as just a friend for some time now.
maybe i shouldn't have let myself feel that way, but--but i have.
and i can't go back.
i'm sorry.
well, if we can't be friends... then i guess we'll be nothing.
(rap music playing loudly in distance)
(music volume increases)
(rap music continues playing loudly)
(decreases volume) hey, leave that alone.
sorry, i was just... turning it down.
what, you're not a music fan?
sure, it's just, um... got anything where a pimp isn't beating h ho?
(chuckles) i'm austin, edie britt's nephew.
oh. (chuckles) i'm julie, susan mayer's daughter.
oh.
anyway, um, i was trying to do my homework, so... on a saturday?
well, make sure and take regular breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.
just keep it down.
you had it really loud.
that's h i like it.
how do you like it?
you know what?
you're not that hot.
hey, whatcha doing?
oh, i'm working on a seating chart--mwah!
for bree's wedding.
nora?
who invited her?
i did. we need to find her another boyfriend, and weddings are crawling with single men.
hey, i hope you're not seating her next to any of my friends.
hey, sacrifices must be made, tom.
no, jerry rawlings!
not jerry rawlings!
yes!
she gets her psycho hooks into jerry rawlings, he will never speak to me again.
oh, there are other urologists in the world.
go back to that other guy.
the one with the cold hands?
oh, it's once a year.
suck it up.
get a grip, lynette.
"get a grip"?
!
i am hanging on for dear life here.
you are the one that brought this little problem into our family, and the only thing i should be hearing from you is,
"how can i help?"
i am also putting steve hanson at her table, so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy.
get a grip.
(cans rattling)
(chuckles)
hi.
my name is susan mayer.
your neighbor told me i could find you here.
yeah?
well, i was at my friend bree's engagement party the other night-- you know, when you came in and you did that whole
"orson killed his wife" thing?
i was just wondering if you could elaborate.
he killed her.
what else do you need to know?
well, what makes you so sure?
do you have any proof?
look, i can't talk now.
i get off at 6:00.
my friend is marrying that man in two hours. please?
okay, i-i need, um, $10 in unrolled pennies, and i need to see you count it, 'cause last time you stiffed me.
after alma disappeared, the police came and searched the house.
the police?
what did they find?
nothing.
and that's bad why?
don't you get it?
when the police showed up, orson had scrubbed every inch of the place clean with bleach.
no fingerprints, no skin cells, no d.n.a.
it was like alma had never existed.
who cleans a house like that unless he has something to hide?
so when i left the bank, i called the detective that worked the case, and he said that the only reason orson was never charged so he was an actual suspect?
he was the only suspect.
oh, my god!
what are we gonna do?
well, you know what we have to do.
that was close.
the florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet, but not to worry.
crisis averted.
bree... we have to talk.
ah, reverend.
any word om the bridal party?
they're still in the bride's room.
you know women.
they're probably in there fussing about mascara and blush.
he did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid!
i said it was a theory.
the point is, alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
i don't have time for this.
i'm getting married now.
this is your day. you can push the ceremony back an hour.
now get that detective on the phone, talk things out with orson.
i can't talk to orson.
it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
you know what's really bad luck?
marrying a wife-killer.
if the three of you don't drop this righnow, i will never forgive you.
bree, we are just doing this because we love you.
but... if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt... none whatsoever.
hmm.
(mendelssohn's "wedding march" playing)
dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of god to join this man and woman in holy-- excuse me?
could you give us just a second?
is something wrong?
i just need a moment.
(guests murmuring) before we do this, there's something i need to ask you.
what?
did you kill your wife?
susan talked to that carolyn woman.
why didn't you tell me thatthe polic because it's embarrassing, and they didn't find anything.
is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
when i'm upset, i clean.
for god's sake, bree, i swear to you i did not kill my wife.
okay.
proceed.
dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of god to join this man and woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate... hey!
look at you, miss popular!
so are you having a good time over there?
as if, and i don't know what idiot stuck me at that table, but every guy over there is just a boring stiff.
all of them?
what about... jerry?
jerry's fun.
you mean mr. fatty hair plugs?
oh, yeah, he's a blast.
(imitates gunshot) um, how about steve?
you know what?
i hear his family has money.
well, then maybe they could all chip in and buy him some deodorant.
i'm through with those losers.
i'm gonna stay right here with you.
are you gonna eat that?
(gasps) hey, look at you!
(sighs) god, i hate wearing a tux.
on my way in, bree's aunt fern asked me to park the car.
she's got glaucoma.
to her, you're nothing but a hispanic blur.
(chuckles) let me fix your tie.
hey, you're wearing mam?
s pearls.
yeah.
oh!
hey, julie!
have you met my nephew austin?
yeah, we've met.
i just didn't recognize him with his shirt on.
she couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
i felt violated.
hi, edie.
nice party, huh?
it was.
perfect.
well, it's nice to see you two getting along again.
we've sort of turned a corner.
really?
does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
maybe.
god, no!
wow, is that shrimp?
what would make you think i would even consider taking you back?
well, you invited me to be your date.
"guest," carlos.
i said "guest." come on, you've been flirting with me since i came in--
"here, baby, let me fix your tie."
i mean, for a woman who's not interested, you sure are sending some mixed signals.
you want a clear signal?
how's
(band playing jazz music) ian!
susan!
what are you doing here?
well, my--my cousin is--is dr. hodges' dental hygienist, and her husband-- he--he couldn't join us since he'd come down with a spot of impetigo, so she called me, knowing how much i love a good garter toss, and so--
ian.
yes, i-i'm such a terrible liar.
i mean, impetigo-- where did that come from?
hmm.
so what are you really doing here?
(sighs) look... i can't stop thinking about us, about how great we could be together, and i think you're making a mistake.
ian-- susan, please don't go.
can't we at least talk about this?
i can't, 'cause i have...
bridesmaid stuff.
hi there.
i just wanted to say you're doing a great job... tad. (chuckles) that's, um, that's such a masculine name.
my boyfriend seems to like it.
okay, here's the drill.
my ex is here, and i wanna piss him off, so just act like you're all hot for me, and there's a 100 buck tip in it for you.
right.
uh, so should i...
cup your boob?
no, i'll drive.
(laughing loudly) oh!
tequila, straight.
hey, are there any decent single women athis wedding?
not that i've seen.
ah, damn it. not a one.
hey, carlos.
you should come over to our table.
that's where all the hotties are.
hey, everyone!
i'd say it is time that we get bree and orson up here for their first dance as a married couple.
ladies and gentlemen, i give you mr. and mrs. orson hodge!
orson, you look so serious.
i'm trying to remember my steps.
you're upset, aren't you?
you're still thinking about what i said at the church.
which part, darling-- the "i do" part, or the "did you kill your wife?" part?
i'm sorry, but i had to ask.
that's my point.
you had to ask.
(up-tempo jazz music playing)
(squealing) you are gonna rot in hell for this.
hey, i just brought two lost souls together.
okay, how about this?
he cheated on my friend.
he deserves every bit of...
(singsong voice) crazy she's gonna rain down on him.
hell... rot... you.
(slow jazz music playing)
what are they doing?
rounding second and heading for third.
uh-oh.
carlos!
oh, hey, gaby.
look, i made a new friend.
yes, i've been watching you make your new friend, and it's disgusting!
do you mind?
we're trying to dance here.
who the hell are you, anyway, and why the hell are you at this wedding?
!
this is not gonna end well.
they're just two random people who met at a wedding.
can't pin it on .
it was her!
lynette scavo, i wanna talk to you!
i'll see you at home.
what are you thinking?
i didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
oh, no, you just wanted me to watch while you sucked the zits off some teenage waiter!
that's it.
i take my invitation back.
you are no longer welcome in my house.
fine, i'll go!
just give me back the pearls.
no!
gaby.
carlos, no!
they were my mam?
s!
no!
(gasps) now look what you've done!
mrs. soils!
no, carlos!
hey, give me that!
give me those!
pardon me. excuse me.
get away!
those are mine!
no, the hell they are!
mrs. soils?
not now, xiao-mei!
mrs. soils!
oh, for god sakes, what?
!
(liquid splashes)
(guests gasp)
(woman) are you kidding?
i think maybe it's time.
and i wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
(rim shot, applause) wow.
that was beautiful, aunt fern.
thank you.
hey, they mopped up all the amniotic fluid, so we should feel safe start the conga line!
(piano starts playing) actually, i'd--i'd like to say a few words.
(piano stops playing) bree, orson, your love is an inspiration to us all.
that's very sweet.
hmm.
how do you know him?
i thought he was on your side.
mnh-mnh.
well, i know this is a second wedding for both of you, and i think you're jolly brave.
so often, people find excuses not to fall in love again.
they're--they're afraid.
but it's rare to find somebody that you connect with, so when you do, you have to follow your heart.
bree, orson, i salute you.
all right, let's get the music cranking and the-- wait, actually, tom, could you just hang on a second?
uh, i-i also would like to say a few words.
to bree and orson, uh, yes, what could be better than a second love?
and this time you enter into it a little older, little wiser, but also-- and this is key--uh... with a bit of caution.
because... while love can be spontaneous and wonderful,
it can also be selfish.
and sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away.
uh... i--not you two.
i mean, you two crazkids are great. (laughs) congrats, yeah.
well, then, let's-- hang on. i'd like to respond to that toast.
bree, orson, sometimes walking away can seem the best choice.
it's--it's certainly the safest.
but... but what do you do when you find someone who makes you feel joy when you thought you never would again?
do you-- do you just let them go?
no.
no, i can't do that.
(microphone feedback squeaks) you--you wanna... no.
i'm go.
all right then, let's dance!
**
well, i thought you might need a change of clothes.
you're still mad at me, huh?
what were you thinking, setting carlos up with skank?
!
i'm sorry.
i was desperate.
i had a little too much to drink.
and you are divorcing carlos... no, lynette, carlos wl never be fair game.
you know the rules.
you're right.
you are right. you're right.
i'm so sorry.
it's just... what?
i'm so unhappy.
ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives, i-i can't even wo up a smile.
and the more she pushes, the more i resent tom-- tom, for something he did 12 years ago.
and i'm afraid if i can't fix... this, that... the anger is just gonna fester until... lynette, listen to me--
you and tom will survive this.
no, seriously, gaby, i am so tired of pretending to smile.
you and tom... will survive this.
yeah?
how can you be so sure?
because some marriages were built to last... and some aren't.
trust me, i know the difference.
(applause)
(both chuckle) i'm looking for bree van de kamp.
right over there.
could you excuse me for just a minute?
mm-hmm.
orson, congratulations.
excuse me.
are you mrs. van de kamp?
it's hodge now.
yes, i'm terribly sorry to barge in like this, but we need your husband to come down to the morgue.
we may have found his wife's body.
(grunting) push, xiao-mei. push.
(groaning) okay, okay.
deep breaths now.
you're getting close.
it's time!
i can't believe this is happening!
i think i'm gonna cry.
carlos, i am so sorry about the-- yeah, i--me, too. me, too.
i was way out of line.
i forgive you. it's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
(grunting) okay, i can see the head now.
oh, get the camera!
get the camera!
(grunting) oh!
(gaby) oh, my god!
(baby crying)
oh, man, i gotta get the color fixed on this thing.
how could this ha happened?
what kind of half-ass fertility clinic are you running?
uh, prior to implantation, our embryo was accidentally switched with another client's.
so if we got theirs and they got ours, then--then it's possible... no, i'm afraid your embryo didn't take.
again, on behalf of the clinic, i am so sorry.
it's rare, but these things do happen.
excuse me.
you screw up our lives, and the best you can do is,
"that's the way the cookie crumbles"?
!
and who is this guy?
why is he writing down everything i say?
this is mr. darby, our attorney.
we thought it wise to have him present.
do you know what else would've been wise?
sticking the right baby in the right belly!
mrs. soils, please.
that's not alma.
are you sure?
absolutely.
thank god.
carolyn.
what is she doing here?
you didn't honestly think they'd take your word for it, did you?
it's not her.
well, that's it then.
sorry for wasting your time.
this means nothing.
i'm telling you, that man is as guilty sin!
we know what you think.
now would you please leave us alone?
he's a cold-blooded killer.
he's kind and decent, and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again.
now please go.
you deserve him.
darling, i am so sorry you had to endure that.
are you all right?
i'm fine. let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
all right.
tu me manques, monique.
well... yeah.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
It means a lot to her to feel included.
Sometimes dark clouds have silver linings...
He sort of asked me out.
It's okay with you if I go out with him?
Sometimes they don't.
Once that baby comes, I'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone.
When it comes to life on Wisteria Lane...
Will you marry me?
Things that seem too good to be true...
Does she know you killed your wife?
Usually turn out...
Get away from him now while you can.
To be deadly.
Brides are sensitive creatures, and no one knows this better than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them.
Well, I think a 10-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice, and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it.
Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.
Uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet?
But if you got a band, maybe people could dance, as opposed to sway.
But the one area where a bridesmaid's tact is most required involves the dress...
So what do you think?
she's required to wear.
Well, um...
I'm not sure that I've ever seen this shade of green before.
Yeah, don't you think it'll be gorgeous with my coloring?
Yes, it would look perfect.
For someone with your coloring.
I mean, I was lucky to find these.
Not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
Then why the rush?
Yeah, Bree, I'd have thought of you as a person who wants time to plan.
Well, Orson and I talked about it, and we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait.
And with your help, I'm sure we can get it all done.
Well, we are happy to pitch in.
Oh, uh, that reminds me.
I have to get a copy of the seating chart for you.
Gaby, you are in charge of the centerpieces.
And don't worry, Susan.
I will think of a job for you.
Here's a job.
How about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
Susan, we don't know that!
All we have is some crazy woman's accusations.
His wife vanished, and he didn't even tell Bree.
How much more proof do you need?
He says he's innocent.
She believes him.
If we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us.
Well, I'm sorry.
I cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life!
And what mistake would that be?
Well...
Honestly...
Yes, a bridesmaid can question many of the bride's choices.
These dresses are hideous.
But the groom isn't one of them.
By Tyno, Wisteria Team Transcript by YDY
The perfect couple...
We've all met them, haven't we?
That man and woman so clearly made for each other, we feel certain they're on the road to happiness.
But that road has many detours, and even perfect couples can find themselves... at a dead end.
You want what?
!
You heard me.
And I want the bedroom stereo.
I want the marble console and that painting of St. Augustine.
You don't even know who he is.
I know he matches the drapes.
People, can we focus here?
And I want my pearl necklace back.
Don't think I didn't notice that you swiped it.
That was my Mama's and hers before her.
I think it belongs in my family.
There was a time that you thought I belonged in your family, and you got over that.
-Stop eating my fries!
-I'm hungry.
You know what the doctor said.
You should see his cholesterol.
This man bleeds baking grease.
Enough!
You two are gonna have to find a way to deal with each other, because you are about to bring a child into this world.
And divorced or not, once that child arrives, you will be bound together for as long as you live.
Well, in that case...
Have some more fries.
I'll pick Kayla up on Sunday.
Whenever.
Just go.
You and Turk have a great time.
Oh, trust me, we will.
The man is a jackhammer.
Bye, Tom.
See you Sunday!
Where is she going?
She and Turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
That's Turk?
That's the new boyfriend?
Uh-Uh, no.
Hey, hey, hey, Tom, please.
I don't want my daughter hanging around with a guy like that.
You haven't even met him.
He could be the sweetest man in the world.
More importantly, ever since he entered the picture, squeaky fromme is never around.
It has been bliss.
I haven't made this face... in a week.
If you ruin this, so help me, I will hurt you.
Just look at him.
Look at him, please.
I swear, that is a child's skull hanging from his rearview mirror.
Doesn't that concern you?
No, I'm good.
Could be a monkey.
Uh, I think I will have the... mesclun salad.
That's it?
That's all you're having?
Well, all the food is very expensive.
You don't need to whisper.
The waiter knows they're robbing us blind.
You can have whatever you want.
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll just have Jane moved to the V.A. Hospital.
-Oh, my God.
-I'm kidding.
It's fine.
I'll have what she's having.
Of course.
God, I love seeing you laugh.
Oh, well, it's been a long time since I've been in the mood to.
Thank you.
Oh, dear God!
Did I squeeze too hard?
No, it's my wife's parents.
Oh, is this gonna be awkward?
No, no, no, not unless, of course, they see us.
Ian?
Awkward.
Jeff, Renee, what a delightful surprise.
It's so good to see you, dear.
Hello.
I'm Renee, and this my husband Jeff.
Susan Mayer.
Uh, doctor...
Dr. Susan Mayer.
She's new to Jane's neurology team.
I just assumed you worked in Ian's publishing house.
Well, yes, and how nice that would've been, huh?
Um, but, no, no, I'm a...
A brain specialist.
Well, Dr. Mayer, maybe I can ask you, our daughter's most recent E.E.G. showed brain spikes, but it didn't change the score on the Glasgow scale.
Why is that?
What an excellent question.
And this is the, uh... spinal cord.
And it, of course, attaches to the brain.
You don't have to dumb it down for us, doctor.
We've been dealing with Jane's condition for years.
Oh, good.
Um, well, then let's, let's get technical.
Uh, let's give Dr. Mayer the night off.
She was in surgery for ten hours today performing a craniotomy.
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.
How'd it go?
Uh, well, it just...
Wow!
I hear my, my phone vibrating.
Um, hello, uh, Dr. Mayer.
Yeah, what?
You say that his brain shut off?
Oh, well, I'll be right there.
Um, stat.
I'm sorry.
Duty calls.
Orson?
I moved the furniture back!
Good lord, Bree, not again.
Don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
There'll be 200 people staring at us.
You know, Bree...
Since that incident at our engagement party, there's been a lot of dark talk about me.
Well, I don't pay attention to gossip.
I'm just saying I would understand if you had second thoughts about marrying a man who's under a cloud.
Well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman.
Strangers may talk, but I know the truth.
Really?
Men have lied to me before.
Believe me, that'll never happen again.
So you trust me completely?
Clearly, I do.
The body is unusually well-preserved because it was buried in clay.
Do we have a cause of death?
Blunt force trauma to the head.
I want you to pull all the missing persons reports, cross-check against her height, age and weight.
I'm also running a D.N.A. panel since we won't be able to use her dental records.
Why not?
Whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth.
Nora?
What are you doing back?
Are you okay?
Shut the door!
I don't want Kayla to find me like this.
What's wrong?
Tuck and I had a fight.
What?
No!
No, no, no!
What happened?
What happened is, Turk is an ass!
On the way to the river, we stopped off at this bar.
Then we were playing pool, and I got a little bitchy with one of the waitresses.
So who cares, right?
I mean, who cares?
It's a bar, and we all do it, right?
R...
Right.
So he tells me to watch my mouth.
And I'm like, whoa!
Get a load of Mr. Two Strikes trying to tell me how to act in public.
And then he called me a whore.
We're done.
Okay, whoa!
Take a deep breath.
You don't break up with a guy because in a weak moment he calls you a whore.
And then on the way out, he threatened to hit me.
Okay, but he didn't.
-And, you know, until...
-Oh, jeez, Lynette, whose side are you on?
!
I'm on the side of love.
You guys seem like such a perfect couple.
I know.
I just, I...
You know, you don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.
No.
It's over.
I just got off the phone with Turk's parole officer, and I was like,
"Guess who ain't in Nevada no more"?
Click.
I think I'm gonna have to stay here tonight.
Freeze!
Austin?
Anyway...
Mom just got back from her cruise to Jamaica with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
Needless to say, me and Mr. "Can I get you some more hot towels?", we didn't exactly hit it off.
So after I broke his nose, I figured it was great time to come visit my favorite Aunt.
Your mom always did have lousy taste in men.
So, I figured I'd crash here for the night.
Then itch down to Mexico.
Hang out, party.
Yeah, I'm thinking, like, no way in hell.
You're gonna stay here with me until things blow over with your mom, okay?
Cool.
Thanks.
Oh, wait, you're 18, right?
Well that's what my I.D. says.
Yeah, mine, too.
You were supposed to be on bed rest.
I'm bored.
Well, why don't you try putting a pair of pants?
That should kill a couple of hours.
Hey, babe.
What is she doing out bed?
That can't be good for her.
Or the stairs.
What do you want?
The mediator was right.
A month from now we're not just gonna be Carlos and Gaby.
We're gonna be mom and dad, and I don't wanna be at war with the mother of my child.
So, here.
Your Mama's pearls?
Carlos...
Thank you.
And...?
And what?
Wouldn't you like to make some reciprocal gesture?
Fine.
You can come to Bree's wedding reception as my guest.
Thanks.
-Here.
-Here?
You're throwing a... reception?
Yeah, that's our wedding present to Bree.
So I give you a priceless family heirloom, and in return, you invite me to a party at my house that I'm paying for?
Well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?
Things I'll do for jewelry.
Susan, I am so sorry.
Dr. Mayer?
Panic.
Pure panic.
Here.
These are for ruining our first date.
Not in front of Mike!
Oh, look, Mike, Ian brought you flowers.
I'll just go put them in some water.
Look, I was just trying to protect Jane's parents.
Oh, please.
They still haven't accepted the fact that Jane isn't going to wake up.
If they knew that we were on a date, that I was trying to move on, well, it would devastate them.
That's a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, is it?
Excuse me?
A part of you feels that you're cheating on her.
No.
Well, perhaps a small part, but that doesn't mean...
It's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.
That's why we should just stop this right now, because it's all way too complicated,
And I think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
Well, I don't think I can do that.
The truth is, I haven't thought of you as just a friend for some time now.
Maybe I shouldn't have let myself feel that way, but I have.
I can't go back, I'm sorry.
Well, if we can't be friends...
Then I guess we'll be nothing.
Hey, leave that alone.
Sorry, I was just...
Turning it down.
What, you're not a music fan?
Sure, it's just, um...
Got anything where a pimp isn't beating his hoe?
I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.
I'm Julie, Susan Mayer's daughter.
Anyway, um, I was trying to do my homework, so...
On a Saturday?
Well, make sure and take regular breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.
That's how I like it.
How do you like it?
You know what?
You're not that hot.
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm working on a seating chart.
For Bree's wedding.
Nora?
Who invited her?
I did.
We need to find her another boyfriend, and weddings are crawling with single men.
Hey, I hope you're not seating her next to any of my friends.
Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom.
No, Jerry Rawlings!
Not Jerry Rawlings!
If she gets her psycho hooks in Jerry Rawlings, he will never speak to me again.
Oh, there are other urologists in the world.
Go back to that other guy.
The one with the cold hands?
Oh, it's once a year.
Suck it up.
Get a grip, Lynette.
"Get a grip"?
!
I am hanging on for dear life here.
You are the one that brought this little problem into our family,
And the only thing I should be hearing from you is, "how can I help"?
I am also putting Steve Handson at her table, so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy.
Get a grip.
Hi.
My name is Susan Mayer.
Your neighbor told me I could find you here.
Yeah?
Well, I was at my friend Bree's engagement party the other night.
You know, when you came in and you did that whole "Orson killed his wife" thing?
I was just wondering if you could elaborate.
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?
Look, I can't talk now.
-I get off at 6:00.
-My friend is marrying that men in two hours.
Please?
Okay, I need $10 in unroled pennies and I need to see you count it, 'cause last time you stiff me!
After Alma disappeared, the police came and searched the house.
The police?
-What did they find?
-Nothing.
And that's bad, why?
Don't you get it?
When the police showed up, Orson had scrubbed every inch of the place clean with blich.
No fingerprints, no skin cells, no D.N.A.
It was like Alma had never existed.
Who cleans a house like that unless he has something to hide?
So when I left the bank,
I called the detective that worked the case,
And he said that the only reason Orson was never charged was because they never found the body.
So he was an actual suspect?
-He was the only suspect.
-Oh, my God!
What are we gonna do?
Well, you know what we have to do.
That was close.
The florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet, but not to worry.
Crisis averted.
Bree... we have to talk.
Ah, Reverend.
Any word from the bridal party?
They're still in the bride's room.
You know women.
They're probably in there fussing about mascara and blush.
He did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid!
I said it was a theory.
The point is, Alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
I don't have time for this.
I'm getting married now.
This is your day.
You can push the ceremony back an hour.
Now get that detective on the phone, talk things out with Orson.
I can't talk to Orson.
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.
If the three of you don't drop this right now,
I will never forgive you.
Bree, we are just doing this because we love you.
But...
If you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt...
None whatsoever.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of God,
-to join this man and woman in holy...
-Excuse me?
Could you give us just a second?
-Is something wrong?
-I just need a moment.
Before we do this, there's something I need to ask you.
What?
Did you kill your wife?
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.
Why didn't you tell me that the police searched your house?
Because it's embarrassing, and they didn't find anything.
Is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
When I'm upset, I clean.
For God's sake, Bree,
I swear to you I did not kill my wife.
Okay.
Proceed.
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here together in the sight of God, to join this man and woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate...
Hey!
Look at you, miss popular!
So are you having a good time over there?
As if,
And I don't know what idiot stuck me at that table,
But every guy over there is just a boring stiff.
All of them?
What about...
Jerry?
Jerry's fun.
You mean Mr. Fatty hair plugs?
Oh, yeah, he's a blast.
Um, how about Steve?
You know what?
I hear his family has money.
Well, then maybe they could all chip in and buy him some deodorant.
I'm through with those losers.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
Are you gonna eat that?
Hey, look at you!
God, I hate wearing a tux.
On my way in, Bree's Aunt Fern asked me to park the car.
She's got glaucoma.
To her, you're nothing but a hispanic blur.
Let me fix your tie.
Hey, you're wearing Mama's pearls.
Yeah.
Hey, Julie!
Have you met my nephew Austin?
Yeah, we've met.
I just didn't recognize him with his shirt on.
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.
Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?
It was.
Perfect.
Well, it's nice to see you two getting along again.
-We've sort of turned a corner.
-Really?
Does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
-Maybe.
-God, no!
Wow, is that shrimp?
What would make you think I would even consider taking you back?
Well, you invited me to be your date.
"Guest," Carlos.
I said "guest."
Come on, you've been flirting with me since I came in...
"Here, baby, let me fix your tie."
I mean, for a woman who's not interested, you sure are sending some mixed signals.
You want a clear signal?
How's this?
-Ian!
-Susan!
What are you doing here?
Well, my cousin is Dr. Hodges' dental hygienist, and her husband...
He couldn't join us since he'd come down with a spot of impetigo, so she called me,
Knowing how much I love a good garter toss, and so...
Ian.
Yes, I'm such a terrible liar.
Impetigo, where did that come from?
So what are you really doing here?
Look...
I can't stop thinking about us, about how great we could be together, and I think you're making a mistake.
-Ian...
-Susan, please don't go.
Can't we at least talk about this?
I can't, 'cause I have...
bridesmaid stuff.
HI there.
I just wanted to say you're doing a great job...
Tad.
That's, um, that's such a masculine name.
My boyfriend seems to like it.
Okay, here's the drill.
My ex is here, and I wanna piss him off, so just act like you're all hot for me, and there's a 100 buck tip in it for you.
Right.
Uh, so should I... cup your boob?
No, I'll drive.
Tequila, straight.
Hey, are there any decent single women at this wedding?
Not that I've seen.
Ah, damn it.
Not a one.
Hey, Carlos.
You should come over to our table.
That's where all the hotties are.
Hey, everyone!
I'd say it is time that we get Bree and Orson up here for their first dance as a married couple.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge!
Orson, you look so serious.
I'm trying to remember my steps.
You're upset, aren't you?
You're still thinking about what I said at the church.
Which part, darling?
The "I do" part, or the "did you kill your wife?" part?
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.
That's my point.
You had to ask.
You are gonna rot in hell for this.
Hey, I just brought two lost souls together.
Okay, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.
He deserves every bit of... crazy.
She's gonna rain down on him.
Hell... rot... you.
What are they doing?
Rounding second and heading for third.
Carlos!
Oh, hey, Gaby.
Look, I made a new friend.
Yes, I've been watching you make your new friend, and it's disgusting!
Do you mind?
We're trying to dance here.
Who the hell are you, anyway, and why the hell are you at this wedding?
!
This is not gonna end well.
They're just two random people who met at a wedding.
Can't pin it on.
It was her!
Lynette Scavo, I wanna talk to you!
I'll see you at home.
What are you thinking?
I didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
Oh, no, you just wanted me to watch while you sucked the zits off some teenage waiter!
That's it.
I take my invitation back.
You are no longer welcome in my house.
Fine, I'll go!
Just give me back the pearls.
-No!
-Gaby...
-Carlos, no!
-They were my Mama's!
No!
Now look what you've done!
Mrs. Solis!
-No, Carlos!
-Hey, give me that!
-Give me those!
-Pardon me.
Excuse me.
-Get away!
Those are mine!
-No, the hell they are!
Mrs. Solis?
-Not now, Xiao-Mei!
-Mrs.
Solis!
Oh, for God sakes, what?
!
I think maybe it's time.
And I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
That was beautiful, Aunt Fern.
Thank you.
Hey, they mopped up all the amniotic fluid, so we should feel safe start the conga line!
Actually, I'd like to say a few words.
Bree, Orson,
Your love is an inspiration to us all.
-That's very sweet.
-Hmm.
How do you know him?
I thought he was on your side.
Well, I know, this is a second wedding for both of you, and I think you're jolly brave.
So often, people find excuses not to fall in love again.
They're, they're afraid.
But it's rare to find somebody that you connect with, so when you do, you have to follow your heart.
Bree, Orson,
I salute you.
All right, let's get the music cranking and the...
Actually, Tom, could you just hang on a second?
Uh, I also would like to say a few words.
To Bree and Orson, uh, yes, what could be better than a second love?
And this time you enter into it a little older, little wiser, but also, and this is key, uh... with a bit of caution.
Because... while love can be spontaneous and wonderful, it can also be selfish.
And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just to walk away.
Uh...
Not you two.
I mean, you two crazy kids are great.
Congrats, yeah.
Well, then, let's...
Hang on.
I'd like to respond to that toast.
Bree, Orson, sometimes walking away can seem the best choice.
It's certainly the safest.
But...
But what do you do when you find someone who makes you feel joy, when you thought you never would again?
Do you, do you just let them go?
No.
No, I can't do that.
You, you wanna...
No.
I'm good.
All right then, let's dance!
Well, I thought you might need a change of clothes.
You're still mad at me, huh?
What were you thinking, setting Carlos up with skank?
!
I'm sorry.
I was desperate.
I had a little too much to drink.
And you are divorcing Carlos...
No, Lynette, Carlos will never be fair game.
You know the rules.
You're right.
You are right.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
It's just...
What?
I'm so unhappy.
Ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives,
I can't even wo up a smile.
And the more she pushes, the more I resent Tom.
Tom, for something he did 12 years ago.
And I'm afraid if I can't fix... this, that...
The anger is just gonna fester until...
Lynette, listen to me.
You and Tom will survive this.
No, seriously Gaby, I am so tired of pretending to smile.
You and Tom...
will survive this.
Yeah?
How can you be so sure?
Because some marriages were built to last...
And some aren't.
Trust me, I know the difference.
I'm looking for Bree Van De Kamp.
Could you excuse me for just a minute?
Orson, congratulations.
Excuse me.
Are you Mrs. Van De Kamp?
It's Hodge now.
Yes, I'm terribly sorry to barge in like this, but we need your husband to come down to the morgue.
We may have found his wife's body.
Push, Xiao-Mei.
Push.
Okay, okay.
Deep breaths now.
You're getting close.
It's time!
I can't believe this is happening!
I think I'm gonna cry.
Carlos, I am so sorry about the...
Yeah, i-Me, too.
Me, too.
I was way out of line.
I forgive you.
It's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
Okay, I can see the head now.
Oh, get the camera!
Get the camera!
Oh, my God!
Oh, man, I gotta get the color fixed on this thing.
How could this has happened?
What kind of half-Ass fertility clinic are you running?
Prior to implantation, your embryo was accidentally switched with another client's.
So if we got theirs and they got ours,
Then it's possible...
No, I'm afraid your embryo didn't take.
Again, on behalf of the clinic, I am so sorry.
It's rare, but these things do happen.
Excuse me.
You screw up our lives, and the best you can do is,
"That's the way the cookie crumbles"?
!
And who is this guy?
Why is he writing down everything I say?
This is Mr. Darby, our attorney.
We thought it wise to have him present.
Do you know what else would've been wise?
Sticking the right baby in the right belly!
Mrs. Solis, please.
That's not Alma.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Thank God.
Carolyn.
What is she doing here?
You didn't honestly think they'd take your word for it, did you?
It's not her.
Well, that's it then.
Sorry for wasting your time.
This means nothing.
I'm telling you, that man is as guilty as sin!
We know what you think.
Now would you please leave us alone?
He's a cold-blooded killer.
He's kind and decent, and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again.
Now please go.
You deserve him.
I hope to.
Darling, I am so sorry you had to endure that.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
Tu me manques, Monique.
Well...
I feel so...
Me, too.
Well, you know what the good news is.
What's that?
Now that there's no baby, it'll make the divorce a lot simpler.
Yeah, that's something.
So...
I'll see you at the mediator's.
See you then.
Have you met the perfect couple...
The two soul mates, whose love never dies?
The two lovers, whose relationship is never threatened?
The husband and wife, who trust each other completely?
If you haven't met the perfect couple, let me introduce you.
They stand atop a layer of buttercream frosting.
The secret of their success?
Well, for starters,
They don't have to look at each other.
Previously on Desperate Housewives:
It means a lot to her to feel included.
Sometimes dark clouds have silver linings.
He sort of asked me out.
It's OK with you if I go out with him?
Sometimes they don't.
Once that baby comes, I'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone.
When it comes to life on Wisteria Lane...
Will you marry me?
...things that seem too good to be true...
- She know you killed your wife?
- ... usually turn out...
Get away from him now while you can.
...to be deadly.
Brides are sensitive creatures, and no one knows this better than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them.
I think a ten-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice, and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it.
Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.
Sure.
Who doesn't love a string quartet?
But if you got a band, maybe people could dance, as opposed to sway.
But one area where a bridesmaid's tact is most required involves the dress...
So what do you think?
...she's required to wear.
Well...
I'm not sure that I've ever seen this shade of green before.
It'll be gorgeous with my coloring.
- Yes, it would look perfect.
- For someone with your coloring.
It's not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
Then why the rush?
Yeah, I'd have thought of you as a person who wants time to plan.
Well, Orson and I talked about it, and we just feel at our age it's silly to wait.
With your help, we can get it all done.
Well, we are happy to pitch in.
I have to get a copy of the seating chart for you, Gabby.
You are in charge of the centerpieces.
And, Susan, I will think of a job for you.
Here's a job.
Talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist.
We don't know that.
All we have is some crazy woman's accusation.
His wife vanished.
He didn't even tell Bree.
- How much proof do you need?
- He says he's innocent.
She believes him.
If we say we don't, she'll hate us.
I'm sorry.
I cannot sit here on my Key-lime ass and watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life.
And what mistake would that be?
Well um...
Honestly...
Yes, a bridesmaid can question many of the bride's choices...
These dresses are hideous.
...but the groom isn't one of them.
The perfect couple.
We've all met them, haven't we?
That man and woman so clearly made for each other, we feel certain they're on the road to happiness.
But that road has many detours.
And even perfect couples can find themselves... at a dead end.
- You want what?
- You heard me.
And I want the bedroom stereo,
I want the marble console, and that painting of St. Augustine.
- You don't even know who he is.
- I know he matches the drapes.
Can we focus?
And my pearl necklace.
I noticed that you swiped it.
That was Mama's, and her mama's.
It belongs in my family.
You thought I belonged in your family, and you got over that.
- Stop eating my fries.
- I'm hungry.
You know what the doctor said.
This man bleeds bacon grease.
Enough.
You have to find a way to deal with each other.
You are about to bring a child into this world and, divorced or not, once that child arrives, you'll be bound together for as long as you live.
Well, in that case, have some more fries.
- I'll pick Kayla up Sunday.
- Whenever, go.
You and Turk have a great time.
Trust me, we will.
- The man is a jackhammer.
- Ah.
- Bye, Tom.
See ya Sunday.
- Bye.
Where is she going?
She and Turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
That's Turk?
That's the new boyfriend?
No.
Hey, Tom, please.
I don't want my daughter with a guy like that.
You haven't even met him.
He could be the sweetest man in the world.
More importantly, since he entered the picture,
Squeaky Fromme is never around.
It has been bliss.
I haven't made this face in a week.
- If you ruin this, I will hurt you.
- Just look at him, please.
That is a child's skull hanging from his rearview mirror.
- Doesn't that concern you?
- No, I'm good.
Could be a monkey.
Uh, I think I will have the mesclun salad.
That's it?
That's all you're having?
- Well, all the food is very expensive.
- You don't need to whisper.
The waiter knows they're robbing us blind.
You can have whatever you want.
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles.
Is that OK?
Fine.
I'll just have Jane moved to the VA hospital.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm kidding.
It's fine.
- I'll have what she's having.
- Of course.
Thank you.
God, I love seeing you laugh.
It's been a long time since I've been in the mood to.
Thank you.
Oh, dear God.
- Did I squeeze too hard?
- No.
It's my wife's parents.
Oh!
Oh, wow.
Is this gonna be awkward?
No, not unless, of course, they see us.
- Ian.
- Awkward.
Jeff.
Renee.
What a delightful surprise.
It's so good to see you, dear.
Hello.
I'm Renee, and this is my husband, Jeff.
- Susan Mayer.
- Doctor.
Dr. Susan Mayer.
She's new to Jane's neurology team.
Oh.
I just assumed you worked in Ian's publishing house.
Well, yes, how nice that would have been, huh?
But no, no.
I'm... a brain specialist.
Well, Dr. Mayer, maybe I can ask you.
Our daughter's most recent EEG showed brain spikes, but it didn't change the score on her Glasgow scale.
Why is that?
What an excellent question.
And this is the spinal cord.
And it, of course, attaches to the brain.
You don't have to dumb it down for us.
We've been dealing with Jane's condition for years.
Oh.
Good.
- Well, then, let's get technical.
- Let's give Dr. Mayer the night off.
She was in surgery for ten hours today, performing a craniotomy.
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.
How'd it go?
Uh, well, it just...
Wow.
I hear my phone vibrating.
Hello.
Dr. Mayer.
Yeah, what?
You say that his brain shut off?
I'll be right there.
Stat.
I'm sorry.
Duty calls.
Orson, I moved the furniture back.
Good Lord, Bree.
Not again.
Don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
There'll be 200 people staring at us.
You know, Bree, since that incident at our engagement party, there's been a lot of dark talk about me.
I don't pay attention to gossip.
I'd understand if you had second thoughts about marrying a man who's under a cloud.
No one who knows you could believe you could hurt a woman.
Strangers may talk, but I know the truth.
Really?
Men have lied to me before.
Believe me, it'll never happen again.
So you trust me completely?
Clearly I do.
The body's unusually well-preserved because it was buried in clay.
- Do we have a cause of death?
- Blunt force trauma to the head.
Pull all the missing persons reports.
Cross-check against her height, age, and weight.
I'm running a DNA panel, since we won't be able to use her dental records.
Why not?
Whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth.
Nora.
What are you doing back?
Are you OK?
- Shut the door.
- OK.
I don't want Kayla to find me like this.
- What's wrong?
- Turk and I had a fight.
What?
No.
No, no, no.
- What happened?
- What happened is, Turk is an ass.
We stopped off at this bar and I got bitchy with one of the waitresses.
Who cares, right?
I mean, who cares?
It's a bar, and we all do it, right?
Right.
So, he tells me to watch my mouth, and I'm like, whoa, get a load of Mr. Two Strikes trying to tell me how to act in public.
And then he called me a whore.
We're done.
OK, whoa, whoa.
Take a deep breath.
You don't break up with a guy because in a weak moment he calls you a whore.
And then on the way out, he threatened to hit me.
OK, but he didn't, and until he...
Oh, jeez, Lynette.
Whose side are you on?
I'm on the side of love.
You guys seem like such a perfect couple.
- I know.
- I just...
You don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.
No.
It's over.
I just got off the phone with Turk's parole officer and I was like,
"Guess who ain't in Nevada no more?"
Click.
I think I'm gonna have to stay here tonight.
Freeze!
- Austin?
- Hey, Aunt Edie.
Anyway, Mom just got back from her cruise to Jamaica with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
Needless to say, me and Mr. Can I Get You Some More Hot Towels?
we didn't exactly hit it off.
After I broke his nose, I figured it was time to visit my favorite aunt.
Your mom always did have lousy taste in men.
So, I figured I'd crash here for the night, then hitch down to Mexico, hang out, party.
Yeah.
I'm thinking, like, no way in hell.
Stay here with me until things blow over with your mom, OK?
Cool.
Thanks.
Wait.
You're 18, right?
- Well, that's what my ID says.
- Yeah, mine too.
Hey!
You are supposed to be on bed rest.
I'm bored.
Try putting on a pair of pants.
That should kill a couple of hours.
Hey, babe.
Hey, what is she doing out of bed?
That can't be good for her.
Or the stairs.
- What do you want?
- The mediator was right.
A month from now, we're not just gonna be Carlos and Gabby, we're gonna be Mom and Dad.
And I don't wanna be at war with the mother of my child.
So, here.
Your mama's pearls.
Carlos.
- Thank you.
- And?
And what?
Wouldn't you like to make some reciprocal gesture?
Fine.
You can come to Bree's wedding reception, as my guest.
- Thanks.
Where is it?
- Here.
Here?
You're throwing the reception?
It's our wedding present to Bree.
I give you a priceless family heirloom, and in return you invite me to a party at my house that I'm paying for?
Well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?
- Mmm.
- The things I'll do for jewelry.
Susan, I am so sorry.
Dr. Mayer?
Panic.
Pure panic.
Here.
These are for ruining our first date.
Shh!
Not in front of Mike.
Look, Mike, Ian brought you flowers.
I'll just go put them in some water.
Look, I was just trying to protect Jane's parents.
Oh, please...
They haven't accepted the fact that Jane isn't going to wake up.
If they knew we were on a date, that I was trying to move on, well, it would devastate them.
A lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story.
Excuse me?
A part of you feels like you're cheating on her.
No.
Well, perhaps a small part, but that doesn't mean...
It's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.
We should just stop this right now because it's all way too complicated.
I think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
Well, I don't think I can do that.
The truth is, I haven't thought of you as just a friend for some time now.
Maybe I shouldn't have let myself feel that way, but I have.
And I can't go back.
I'm sorry.
Well, if we can't be friends then I guess we'll be nothing.
Hey, leave that alone.
Sorry.
I was just turning it down.
- You're not a music fan?
- Sure.
It's just, got anything where a pimp isn't beating his ho?
I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.
Oh.
I'm Julie.
Susan Mayer's daughter.
Oh...
Anyway, I was trying to do my homework, so...
On a Saturday?
Well, make sure and take regular breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.
That's how I like it.
How do you like it?
You know what?
You're not that hot.
Hey, what you doing?
I'm working on the seating chart for Bree's wedding.
- Nora?
Who invited her?
- I did.
We need to find her another boyfriend.
Weddings are crawling with single men.
You're not seating her next to my friends?
- Sacrifices must be made, Tom.
- Not Jerry Rawlings.
If she gets her psycho hooks into Jerry, he will never speak to me again.
There are other urologists.
Go back to that other guy.
- The one with the cold hands?
- It's once a year.
Suck it up.
Get a grip, Lynette.
Get a grip?
I am hanging on for dear life here.
You are the one that brought this little problem into our family, and the only thing I should be hearing from you is, "How can I help?"
I am also putting Steve Hanson at her table, so you might wanna start shopping around for a new golf buddy.
Get a grip.
Hi.
My name's Susan Mayer.
Your neighbor told me I could find you here.
Yeah?
Well, I was at my friend Bree's engagement party, when you came in and you did that whole "Orson killed his wife" thing.
I was wondering if you could elaborate.
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?
Look, I can't talk now.
I get off at six.
My friend is marrying that man in two hours.
Please.
OK, I need ten dollars in unrolled pennies, and I need to see you count it because last time you stiffed me.
After Alma disappeared, the police came and searched the house.
The police?
What did they find?
Nothing.
- And that's bad why?
- Don't you get it?
When the police showed up, Orson had scrubbed every inch clean with bleach.
No fingerprints, no skin cells, no DNA.
It was like Alma had never existed.
Who cleans a house like that unless he has something to hide?
When I left the bank, I called the detective that worked the case.
He said that the only reason Orson was never charged was because they never found a body.
- So he was an actual suspect?
- He was the only suspect.
- What are we gonna do?
- Well, you know what we have to do.
That was close.
The florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet, but not to worry, crisis averted.
Bree, we have to talk.
Ah, Reverend.
Any word from the bridal party?
Still in the bride's room.
You know women.
They're probably fussing about mascara and blush.
He did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid.
I said it was a theory.
Alma disappeared under suspicious circumstances.
I don't have time.
I'm getting married.
You can push the ceremony back an hour.
Now, get that detective on the phone.
Talk things out with Orson.
I can't.
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.
If the three of you don't drop this right now, I will never forgive you.
Bree, we are just doing this because we love you.
But if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt...
None whatsoever.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of God to join this man and woman in holy...
Excuse me.
Could you give us just a second?
- Is something wrong?
- I just need a moment.
Before we do this, there's something I need to ask you.
What?
Did you kill your wife?
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.
Why didn't you tell me the police searched your house?
Because it's embarrassing.
And they didn't find anything.
Is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
When I'm upset, I clean.
For God's sake, Bree, I swear to you, I did not kill my wife.
OK.
Proceed.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of God to join this man and woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate...
Hey.
Look at you, Miss Popular.
So, are you having a good time over there?
As if.
And I don't know what idiot stuck me at that table, but every guy over there is just a boring stiff.
All of them?
What about Jerry?
Jerry's fun.
You mean Mr. Fatty Hair Plugs?
Yeah, he's a blast.
How about Steve?
You know what, I hear his family has money.
Well, then maybe they could all chip in and buy him some deodorant.
I'm through with those losers.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
Are you gonna eat that?
- Hey, look at you.
- God, I hate wearing a tux.
On my way in, Bree's Aunt Fern asked me to park the car.
She's got glaucoma.
To her, you're nothing but a Hispanic blur.
Let me fix your tie.
Hey, you're wearing Mama's pearls.
Yeah.
Oh...
Hey, Julie.
Have you met my nephew Austin?
Yeah, we've met.
I just didn't recognize him with his shirt on.
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.
- Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?
- It was.
Perfect.
It's nice to see you two getting along again.
- We've sort of turned a corner.
- You're gonna be getting back together?
- God, no.
- Maybe.
Wow, is that shrimp?
What would make you think I'd even consider taking you back?
- You invited me to be your date.
- Guest, Carlos.
I said guest.
You've been flirting with me since I came in. "Baby, let me fix your tie. "
You sure are sending some mixed signals.
You want a clear signal?
How's this?
- Ian.
- Susan.
What are you doing here?
Well, my cousin is Dr. Hodge's dental hygienist.
Her husband couldn't join her, since he'd come down with impetigo.
She called me, knowing how much I love a good garter toss...
Ian...
Yes, I'm such a terrible liar.
I mean, impetigo.
Where did that come from?
Hmm.
So, what are you really doing here?
Look, I can't stop thinking about us, about how great we could be together.
- I think you're making a mistake.
- Ian...
Susan, please don't go.
Can't we at least talk about this?
I can't, 'cause I have bridesmaid stuff.
Hi there.
I just wanted to say you're doing a great job...
Tad.
That's such a masculine name.
My boyfriend seems to like it.
OK, here's the drill.
My ex, I wanna piss him off, so act like you're hot for me.
- There's a hundred-buck tip in it.
- Right.
So, should I cup your boob?
No, I'll drive.
Tequila.
Straight.
Hey, are there any decent single women at this wedding?
Not that I've seen.
Damn it, not a one.
Hey, Carlos.
You should come over to our table.
That's where all the hotties are.
Hey, everyone.
I'd say it is time that we get Bree and Orson up here for their first dance as a married couple.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge.
- Orson, you look so serious.
- I'm trying to remember my steps.
You're upset.
You're still thinking about what I said at the church.
Which part, darling?
The "I do" part or the "Did you kill your wife?" part?
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.
That's my point.
You had to ask.
You are gonna rot in hell for this.
Hey, I just brought two lost souls together.
OK, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.
He deserves every bit of crazy she's gonna rain down on him.
Hell, rot, you.
What are they doing?
Rounding second and heading for third.
Uh-oh.
- Carlos.
- Hey, Gabby.
Look, I made a new friend.
I've been watching you make your new friend, and it's disgusting.
- Do you mind?
We're trying to dance.
- Who the hell are you, anyway?
And why the hell are you at this wedding?
This is not gonna end well.
They're just two random people who met at a wedding.
They can't pin it on me.
It was her.
Lynette Scavo, I wanna talk to you.
I'll see you at home.
I didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
You just wanted me to watch while you suck the zits off some teenage waiter.
That's it.
I take my invitation back.
You are no longer welcome in my house.
Fine.
I'll go.
Just give me back the pearls.
- No!
- Gabby.
- Carlos, no.
- They were Mama's.
No!
Now look what you've done.
- Mrs. Solis.
- No, Carlos.
Give me those.
- Pardon me, excuse me.
- Get away.
Those are mine.
- The hell they are.
- Mrs. Solis.
- Not now, Xiao Mei.
- Mrs. Solis!
For God's sakes, what?
I think maybe it's time.
And I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
Wow.
That was beautiful, Aunt Fern.
Thank you.
Hey, they mopped up all the amniotic fluid, so we should feel safe to start the conga line.
Actually, I'd like to say a few words.
Bree, Orson, your love is an inspiration to us all.
That's very sweet.
How do you know him?
I thought he was on your side.
This is a second wedding for both of you, and I think you're jolly brave.
So often people find excuses not to fall in love again.
They're afraid.
But it's rare to find somebody that you connect with, so you have to follow your heart.
Bree, Orson, I salute you.
Let's get the music cranking, and...
Actually, Tom, could you just hang on a second?
I also would like to say a few words.
To Bree and Orson.
Yes, what could be better than a second love?
And this time, you enter into it a little older, a little wiser.
But also, and this is key, with a bit of caution.
Because while love can be spontaneous and wonderful, it can also be selfish, and sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away.
Uh... not you two.
I mean, you two crazy kids are great.
Congrats.
- Well, then, let's...
- I'd like to respond to that toast.
Bree, Orson, sometimes walking away can seem the best choice, it's certainly the safest, but what do you do when you find someone who makes you feel joy when you thought you never would again?
Do you just let them go?
No.
No, I can't do that.
You wanna...?
No.
I'm good.
All right, then, let's dance.
Well, I thought you might need a change of clothes.
- Yeah, you're still mad at me, huh?
- What were you thinking?
- Setting Carlos up with that skank.
- I am sorry.
I was desperate.
I had a little too much to drink.
And you are divorcing Carlos.
No, Lynette, Carlos will never be fair game.
You know the rules.
You're right.
You are right.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
It's just...
What?
I'm so unhappy.
Ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives,
I can't even work up a smile.
And the more she pushes, the more I resent Tom.
Tom, for something he did 12 years ago.
And I'm afraid if I can't fix this that the anger's just gonna fester, until...
Lynette, listen to me.
You and Tom will survive this.
No, seriously, Gabby.
I am so tired of pretending to smile.
You and Tom will survive this.
Yeah?
How can you be so sure?
Because some marriages were built to last.
And some aren't.
Trust me, I know the difference.
I'm looking for Bree Van de Kamp.
Could you excuse me for just a minute?
Orson, congratulations.
Excuse me.
Are you Mrs. Van de Kamp?
It's Hodge now.
Yes, I'm terribly sorry to barge in like this, but we need your husband to come down to the morgue.
We may have found his wife's body.
Push, Xiao Mei, push.
OK, OK.
Deep breaths now.
We're getting close.
It's time.
I can't believe this is happening.
Honey, I'm gonna cry.
- Carlos, I am so sorry about the...
- Me too, me too.
- I was way out of line.
- I forgive you.
It's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
- OK, I can see the head now.
- Get the camera.
Get the camera.
Oh, my God.
Man, I gotta get the color fixed on this thing.
What kind of half-assed fertility clinic are you running?
Prior to implantation, your embryo was switched with another client's.
So if we got theirs and they got ours, then it's possible...
I'm afraid your embryo didn't take.
Again, on behalf of the clinic, I am so sorry.
- It's rare, but things do happen.
- Excuse me.
You screw up our lives and the best you can do is,
"That's the way the cookie crumbles"?
Why is this guy writing down everything I say?
Mr. Darby, our attorney.
We thought it wise to have him present.
Know what else would've been wise?
Sticking the right baby in the right belly.
Mrs. Solis, please...
That's not Alma.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
Thank God.
Carolyn.
What is she doing here?
You didn't honestly think they'd take your word for it, did you?
It's not her.
Well, that's it, then.
Sorry for wasting your time.
This means nothing.
I'm telling you, that man is as guilty as sin.
We know what you think.
Now, would you please leave us alone?
He's a cold-blooded killer.
He's kind and decent, and nothing you could say will make me doubt him again.
Now, please go.
- You deserve him.
- I hope to.
Darling, I am so sorry you had to endure that.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Let's just go back to our guests and forget this ever happened.
All right.
Tu me manques, Monique.
Well...
Yeah.
I feel so...
Me, too.
Well, you know what the good news is?
What's that?
Now that there's no baby, it'll make the divorce a lot simpler.
Yeah, that's something.
So...
See you at the mediator's.
See you then.
Have you met the perfect couple?
The two soul mates whose love never dies?
The two lovers whose relationship is never threatened?
The husband and wife who trust each other completely?
If you haven't met the perfect couple, let me introduce you.
They stand atop a layer of butter cream frosting.
The secret of their success?
Well, for starters, they don't have to look at each other.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
It means a lot to her to feel included.
Sometimes dark clouds have silver linings...
He sort of asked me out.
It's okay with you if I go out with him?
Sometimes they don't.
Once that baby comes, I'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone.
When it comes to life on Wisteria Lane...
Will you marry me?
Things that seem too good to be true...
Does she know you killed your wife?
Usually turn out...
Get away from him now while you can.
To be deadly.
Brides are sensitive creatures, and no one knows this better than the bridesmaids who have to deal with them.
Well, I think a 10-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice, and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it.
Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.
Uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet?
But if you got a band, maybe people could dance, as opposed to sway.
But the one area where a bridesmaid's tact is most required involves the dress...
So what do you think?
she's required to wear.
Well, um...
I'm not sure that I've ever seen this shade of green before.
Yeah, don't you think it'll be gorgeous with my coloring?
Yes, it would look perfect.
For someone with your coloring.
I mean, I was lucky to find these.
Not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
Then why the rush?
Yeah, Bree, I'd have thought of you as a person who wants time to plan.
Well, Orson and I talked about it, and we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait.
And with your help, I'm sure we can get it all done.
Well, we are happy to pitch in.
Oh, uh, that reminds me.
I have to get a copy of the seating chart for you.
Gaby, you are in charge of the centerpieces.
And don't worry, Susan.
I will thinkf a job for you.
Here's a job.
How about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
Susan, we don't know that!
All we have is some crazy woman's accusations.
His wife vanished, and he didn't even tell Bree.
How much more proof do you need?
He says he's innocent.
She believes him.
If we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us.
Well, I'm sorry.
I cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life!
And what mistake would that be?
Well...
Honestly...
Yes, a bridesmaid can question many of the bride's choices.
These dresses are hideous.
But the groom isn't one of them.
By Tyno, Wisteria Team Transcript by YDY
The perfect couple...
We've all met them, haven't we?
That man and woman so clearly made for each other, we feel certain they're on the road to happiness.
But that road has many detours, and even perfect couples can find themselves... at a dead end.
You want what?
!
You heard me.
And I want the bedroom stereo.
I want the marble console and that painting of St. Augustine.
You don't even know who he is.
I know he matches the drapes.
People, can we focus here?
And I want my pearl necklace back.
Don't think I didn't notice that you swiped it.
That was my Mama's and hers before her.
I think it belongs in my family.
There was a time that you thought I belonged in your family, and you got over that.
-Stop eating my fries!
-I'm hungry.
You know what the doctor said.
You should see his cholesterol.
This man bleeds baking grease.
Enough!
You two are gonna have to find a way to deal with each other, because you are about to bring a child into this world.
And divorced or not, once that child arrives, you will be bound together for as long as you live.
Well, in that case...
Have some more fries.
I'll pick Kayla up on Sunday.
Whenever.
Just go.
You and Turk have a great time.
Oh, trust me, we will.
The man is a jackhammer.
Bye, Tom.
See you Sunday!
Where is she going?
She and Turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
That's Turk?
That's the new boyfriend?
Uh-Uh, no.
Hey, hey, hey, Tom, please.
I don't want my daughter hanging around with a guy like that.
You haven't even met him.
He could be the sweetest man in the world.
More importantly, ever since he entered the picture, squeaky fromme is never around.
It has been bliss.
I haven't made this face... in a week.
If you ruin this, so help me, I will hurt you.
Just look at him.
Look at him, please.
I swear, that is a child's skull hanging from his rearview mirror.
Doesn't that concern you?
No, I'm good.
Could be a monkey.
Uh, I think I will have the... mesclun salad.
That's it?
That's all you're having?
Well, all the food is very expensive.
You don't need to whisper.
The waiter knows they're robbing us blind.
You can have whatever you want.
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll just have jane moved to the V. A. Hospital.
-Oh, my God.
-I'm kidding.
It's fine.
I'll have what she's having.
Of course.
God, I love seeing you laugh.
Oh, well, it's been a long time since I've been in the mood to.
Thank you.
Oh, dear God!
Did I squeeze too hard?
No, it's my wife's parents.
Oh, is this gonna be awkward?
No, no, no, not unless, of course, they see us.
Ian?
Awkward.
Jeff, Renee, what a delightful surprise.
It's so good to see you, dear.
Hello.
I'm Renee, and this my husband Jeff.
Susan Mayer.
Uh, doctor...
Dr. Susan Mayer.
She's new to Jane's neurology team.
I just assumed you worked in Ian's publishing house.
Well, yes, and how nice that would've been, huh?
Um, but, no, no, I'm a...
A brain specialist.
Well, Dr. Mayer, maybe I can ask you, our daughter's most recent E.E.G. showed brain spikes, but it didn't change the score on the glasgow scale.
Why is that?
What an excellent question.
And this is the, uh... spinal cord.
And it, of course, attaches to the brain.
You don't have to dumb it down for us, doctor.
We've been dealing with Jane's condition for years.
Oh, good.
Um, well, then let's, let's get technical.
Uh, let's give Dr. Mayer the night off.
She was in surgery for ten hours today performing a craniotomy.
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.
How'd it go?
Uh, well, it just...
Wow!
I hear my, my phone vibrating.
Um, hello, uh, Dr. Mayer.
Yeah, what?
You say that his brain shut off?
Oh, well, I'll be right there.
Um, stat.
I'm sorry.
Duty calls.
Orson?
I moved the furniture back!
Good lord, Bree, not again.
Don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
There'll be 200 people staring at us.
You know, Bree...
Since that incident at our engagement party, there's been a lot of dark talk about me.
Well, I don't pay attention to gossip.
I'm just saying I would understand if you had second thoughts about marrying a man who's under a cloud.
Well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman.
Strangers may talk, but I know the truth.
Really?
Men have lied to me before.
Believe me, that'll never happen again.
So you trust me completely?
Clearly, I do.
The body is unusually well-preserved because it was buried in clay.
Do we have a cause of death?
Blunt force trauma to the head.
I want you to pull all the missing persons reports, cross-check against her height, age and weight.
I'm also running a D.N.A. panel since we won't be able to use her dental records.
Why not?
Whoever killed her pulled out all her teeth.
Nora?
What are you doing back?
Are you okay?
Shut the door!
I don't want kayla to find me like this.
What's wrong?
Tuck and I had a fight.
What?
No!
No, no, no!
What happened?
What happened is, Turk is an ass!
On the way to the river, we stoped off at is bar.
Then we were paying pool, and I got a little bitchy with one of the waitresses.
So who cares, right?
I mean, who cares?
It's a bar, and we all do it, right?
R...
Right.
So he tells me to watch my mouth.
And I'm like, whoa!
Get a load a Mr. Two Strikes trying to tell me how to act in public.
And then he called me a whore.
We're done.
Okay, whoa!
Take a deep breath.
You don't break up with a guy because in a weak moment he calls you a whore.
And then on the way out, he threatened to hit me.
Okay, but he didn't.
-And, you know, until...
-Oh, jeez, Lynette, whose side are you on?
!
I'm on the side of love.
You guys seem like such a perfect couple.
I know.
I just, I...
You know, you don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.
No.
It's over.
I just got off the phone with Turk's parole officer, and I was like,
"Guess who ain't in Nevada no more"?
Click.
I think I'm gonna have to stay here tonight.
Freeze!
Austin?
Anyway...
Mom just got backfrom her cruise to Jamaica with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
Needless to say, me and Mr. "Can I get yousome more hot towels?", we didn't exactly hit it off.
So after I broke his nose, I figured it was great time to come visit my favorite Aunt.
Your mom always did have lousy taste in men.
So, I figured I'd crash here for the night.
Then itch down to Mexico.
Hang out, party.
Yeah, I'm thinking, like, no way in hell.
You're gonna stay here with me until things blow over with your mom, okay?
Cool.
Thanks.
Oh, wait, you're 18, right?
Well that's what my I.D. says.
Yeah, mine, too.
You were supposed to be on bed rest.
I'm bored.
Well, why don't you try putting a pair of pants?
That should kill a couple of hours.
Hey, babe.
What is she doing out bed?
That can't be good for her.
Or the stairs.
What do you want?
The mediator was right.
A month from now we're not just gonna be Carlos and Gaby.
We're gonna be mom and dad, and I don't wanna be at war with the mother of my child.
So, here.
Your Mama's pearls?
Carlos...
Thank you.
And...?
And what?
Wouldn't you like to make some reciprocal gesture?
Fine.
You can come to Bree's wedding reception as my guest.
Thanks.
-Here.
-Here?
You're throwing a... reception?
Yeah, that's our wedding present to Bree.
So I give you a priceless family heirloom, and in return, you invite me to a party at my house that I'm paying for?
Well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?
Things I'll do for jewelry.
Susan, I am so sorry.
Dr. Mayer?
Panic.
Pure panic.
Here.
These are for ruining our first date.
Not in front of Mike!
Oh, look, Mike, Ian brought you flowers.
I'll just go put them in some water.
Look, I was just trying to protect Jane's parents.
Oh, please.
They still haven't accepted the fact that Jane isn't going to wake up.
If they knew that we were on a date, that I was trying to move on, well, it would devastate them.
That a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, isn't it?
Excuse me?
A part of you feels that you're cheating on her.
No.
Well, perhaps a small part, but that doesn't mean...
It's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.
That's why we should just stop is right now, because it's all way too complicated,
And I think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
Well, I don't think I can do that.
The truth is, I haven't thought of you as just a friend for some time now.
Maybe I shouldn't have let myself feel that way, but I have.
I can't go back, I'm sorry.
Well, if we can't be friends...
Then I guess we'll be nothing.
Hey, leave that alone.
Sorry, I was just...
Turning it down.
What, you're not a music fan?
Sure, it's just, um...
Got anything where a pimp isn't beating his ho?
I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.
I'm Julie, Susan Mayer's daughter.
Anyway, um, I was trying to do my homework, so...
On a Saturday?
Well, make sure and take regular breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.
That's how I like it.
How do you like it?
You know what?
You're not that hot.
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm working on a seating chart.
For Bree's wedding.
Nora?
Who invited her?
I did.
We need to find her another boyfriend, and weddings are crawling with single men.
Hey, I hope you're not seating her next to any of my friends.
Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom.
No, Jerry Rawlings!
Not Jerry Rawlings!
If she gets her psycho hooks in Jerry Rawings, he will never speak to me again.
Oh, there are other urologists in the world.
Go back to that other guy.
The one with the cold hands?
Oh, it's once a year.
Suck it up.
Get a grip, Lynette.
"Get a grip"?
!
I am hanging on for dear life here.
You are the one that brought this little problem into our family,
And the only thing I should be hearing from you is, "how can I help"?
I am also putting Stevie Handson at her table, so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy.
Get a grip.
Hi.
My name is Susan Mayer.
Your neighbor told me I could find you here.
Yeah?
Well, I was at my friend Bree's engagement party the other night.
You know, when you came in and you did that whole "Orson killed his wife" thing?
I was just wondering if you could elaborate.
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?
Look, I can't talk now.
-I get off at 6:00.
-My friend is marring that men in two hours.
Please?
Okay, I need $10 in unroled pennies and I need to see you count it, 'cause last time you sttif me!
After Alma disappeared, the police came and searched the house.
The police?
-What did they find?
-Nothing.
And that's bad, why?
Don't you get it?
When the police showed up, Orson had scrubbed every inch of the place clean with blich.
No fingerprints, no skin cells, no D.N.A.
It was like Alma had never existed.
Who cleans a house like that unless he has something to hide?
So when I left the bank,
I called the detective that worked the case,
And he said that the only reason Orson was never charged was because they never found the body.
So he was an actual suspect?
-He was the only suspect.
-Oh, my God!
What are we gonna do?
Well, you know what we have to do.
That was close.
The florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet, but not to worry.
Crisis averted.
Bree... we have to talk.
Ah, Reverend.
Any word from the bridal party?
They're still in the bride's room.
You know women.
They're probably in there fussing about mascara and blush.
He did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid!
I said it was a theory.
The point is, Alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
I don't have time for this.
I'm getting married now.
This is your day.
You can push the ceremony back an hour.
Now get that detective on the phone, talk things out with Orson.
I can't talk to Orson.
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.
If the three of you don't drop this right now,
I will never forgive you.
Bree, we are just doing this because we love you.
But...
If you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt...
None whatsoever.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the sight of God,
-to join this man and woman in holy...
-Excuse me?
Could you give us just a second?
-Is something wrong?
-I just need a moment.
Before we do this, there's something I need to ask you.
What?
Did you kill your wife?
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.
Why didn't you tell me that the police seached your house.
Because it's embarrassing, and they didn't find anything.
Is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
When I'm upset, I clean.
For God's sake, Bree,
I swear to you I did not kill my wife.
Okay.
Proceed.
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here together in the sight of God, to join this man and woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate...
Hey!
Look at you, miss popular!
So are you having a good time over there?
As if,
And I don't know what idiot stuck me at that table,
But every guy over there is just a boring stiff.
All of them?
What about...
Jerry?
Jerry's fun.
You mean Mr. Fatty hair plugs?
Oh, yeah, he's a blast.
Um, how about Steve?
You know what?
I hear his family has money.
Well, then maybe they could all chip in and buy him some deodorant.
I'm through with those losers.
I'm gonna stay right here with you.
Are you gonna eat that?
Hey, look at you!
God, I hate wearing a tux.
On my way in, Bree's Aunt Fern asked me to park the car.
She's got glaucoma.
To her, you're nothing but a hispanic blur.
Let me fix your tie.
Hey, you're wearing Mama's pearls.
Yeah.
Hey, Julie!
Have you met my nephew Austin?
Yeah, we've met.
I just didn't recognize him with his shirt on.
She couldn't take her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.
Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?
It was.
Perfect.
Well, it's nice to see you two getting along again.
We've sort of turned a corner.
Really?
Does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
-Maybe.
-God, no!
Wow, is that shrimp?
What would make you think I would even consider taking you back?
Well, you invited me to be your date.
"Guest," Carlos.
I said "guest."
Come on, you've been flirting with me since I came in...
"Here, baby, let me fix your tie."
I mean, for a woman who's not interested, you sure are sending some mixed signals.
You want a clear signal?
How's this?
-Ian!
-Susan!
What are you doing here?
Well, my cousin is Dr. Hodges' dental hygienist, and her husband...
He couldn't join us since he'd come down with a spot of impetigo, so she called me,
Knowing how much I love a good garter toss, and so...
Ian.
Yes, I'm such a terrible liar.
Impetigo, where did that come from?
So what are you really doing here?
Look...
I can't stop thinking about us, about how great we could be together, and I think you're making a mistake.
-Ian...
-Susan, please don't go.
Can't we at least talk about this?
I can't, 'cause I have...
bridesmaid stuff.
HI there.
I just wanted to say you're doing a great job...
Tad.
That's, um, that's such a masculine name.
My boyfriend seems to like it.
Okay, here's the drill.
My ex is here, and I wanna piss him off, so just act like you're all hot for me, and there's a 100 buck tip in it for you.
Right.
Uh, so should I... cup your boob?
No, I'll drive.
Tequila, straight.
Hey, are there any decent single women athis wedding?
Not that I've seen.
Ah, damn it.
Not a one.
Hey, Carlos.
You should come over to our table.
That's where all the hotties are.
Hey, everyone!
I'd say it is time that we get Bree and Orson up here for their first dance as a married couple.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge!
Orson, you look so serious.
I'm trying to remember my steps.
You're upset, aren't you?
You're still thinking about what I said at the church.
Which part, darling?
The "I do" part, or the "did you kill your wife?" part?
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.
That's my point.
You had to ask.
You are gonna rot in hell for this.
Hey, I just brought two lost souls together.
Okay, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.
He deserves every bit of... crazy.
She's gonna rain down on him.
Hell... rot... you.
What are they doing?
Rounding second and heading for third.
Carlos!
Oh, hey, Gaby.
Look, I made a new friend.
Yes, I've been watching you make your new friend, and it's disgusting!
Do you mind?
We're trying to dance here.
Who the hell are you, anyway, and why the hell are you at this wedding?
!
This is not gonna end well.
They're just two random people who met at a wedding.
Can't pin it on.
It was her!
Lynette Scavo, I wanna talk to you!
I'll see you at home.
What are you thinking?
I didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
Oh, no, you just wanted me to watch while you sucked the zits off some teenage waiter!
That's it.
I take my invitation back.
You are no longer welcome in my house.
Fine, I'll go!
Just give me back the pearls.
-No!
-Gaby...
-Carlos, no!
-They were my Mama's!
No!
Now look what you've done!
Mrs. Solis!
-No, Carlos!
-Hey, give me that!
-Give me those!
-Pardon me.
Excuse me.
-Get away!
Those are mine!
-No, the hell they are!
Mrs. Solis?
-Not now, Xiao-Mei!
-Mrs.
Solis!
Oh, for God sakes, what?
!
I think maybe it's time.
And I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
That was beautiful, Aunt Fern.
Thank you.
Hey, they mopped up all the amniotic fluid, so we should feel safe start the conga line!
Actually, I'd like to say a few words.
Bree, Orson,
Your love is an inspiration to us all.
-That's very sweet.
-Hmm.
How do you know him?
I thought he was on your side.
Well, I know, this is a second wedding for both of you, and I think you're jolly brave.
So often, people find excuses not to fall in love again.
They're, they're afraid.
But it's rare to find somebody that you connect with, so when you do, you have to follow your heart.
Bree, Orson,
I salute you.
All right, let's get the music cranking and the...
Actually, Tom, could you just hang on a second?
Uh, I also would like to say a few words.
To Bree and Orson, uh, yes, what could be better than a second love?
And this time you enter into it a little older, little wiser, but also, and this is key, uh... with a bit of caution.
Because... while love can be spontaneous and wonderful, it can also be selfish.
And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just to walk away.
Uh...
Not you two.
I mean, you two crazy kids are great.
Congrats, yeah.
Well, then, let's...
Hang on.
I'd like to respond to that toast.
Bree, Orson, sometimes walking away can seem the best choice.
It's certainly the safest.
But...
But what do you do when you find someone who makes you feel joy, when you thought you never would again?
Do you, do you just let them go?
No.
No, I can't do that.
You, you wanna...
No.
I'm good.
All right then, let's dance!
Well, I thought you might need a change of clothes.
You're still mad at me, huh?
What were you thinking, setting Carlos up with skank?
!
I'm sorry.
I was desperate.
I had a little too much to drink.
And you are divorcing Carlos...
No, Lynette, Carlos will never be fair game.
You know the rules.
You're right.
You are right.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
It's just...
What?
I'm so unhappy.
Ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives,
I can't even wo up a smile.
And the more she pushes, the more I resent Tom.
Tom, for something he did 12 years ago.
And I'm afraid if I can't fix... this, that...
The anger is just gonna fester until...
Lynette, listen to me.
You and Tom will survive this.
No, seriously, Gaby, I am so tired of pretending to smile.
You and Tom...
will survive this.
Yeah?
How can you be so sure?
Because some marriages were built to last...
And some aren't.
Trust me, I know the difference.
I'm looking for Bree Van De Kamp.
Could you excuse me for just a minute?
Orson, congratulations.
Excuse me.
Are you Mrs. Van De Kamp?
It's Hodge now.
Yes, I'm terribly sorry to barge in like this, but we need your husband to come down to the morgue.
We may have found his wife's body.
Push, Xiao-Mei.
Push.
Okay, okay.
Deep breaths now.
You're getting close.
It's time!
I can't believe this is happening!
I think I'm gonna cry.
Carlos, I am so sorry about the...
Yeah, i-Me, too.
Me, too.
I was way out of line.
I forgive you.
It's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
Okay, I can see the head now.
Oh, get the camera!
Get the camera!
Oh, my God!
Oh, man, I gotta get the color fixed on this thing.
How could this has happened?
What kind of half-Ass fertility clinic are you running?
Prior to implantation, your embryo was accidentally switched with another client's.
So if we got theirs and they got ours,
Then it's possible...
No, I'm afraid your embryo didn't take.
Again, on behalf of the clinic, I am so sorry.
It's rare, but these things do happen.
Excuse me.
You screw up our lives, and the best you can do is,
"That's the way the cookie crumbles"?
!
And who is this guy?
Why is he writing down everything I say?
This is Mr. Darby, our attorney.
We thought it wise to have him present.
Do you know what else would've been wise?
Sticking the right baby in the right belly!
Mrs. Solis, please.
That's not Alma.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Thank God.
Carolyn.
What is she doing here?
You didn't honestly think they'd take your word for it, did you?
It's not her.
Well, that's it then.
Sorry for wasting your time.
This means nothing.
I'm telling you, that man is as guilty sin!
We know what you think.
Now would you please leave us alone?
He's a cold-Blooded killer.
He's kind and decent, and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again.
Now please go.
You deserve him.
Darling, I am so sorry you had to endure that.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
All right.
Tu me manques, Monique.
Well...
I feel so...
Me, too.
Well, you know what the good news is.
What's that?
Now that there's no baby, it'll make the divorce a lot simpler.
Yeah, that's something.
So...
I'll see you at the mediator's.
See you then.
Have you met the perfect couple...
The two soul mates, whose love never dies?
The two lovers, whose relationship is never threatened?
The husband and wife, who trust each other completely?
If you haven't met the perfect couple, let me introduce you.
They stand atop a layer of buttercream frosting.
The secret of their success?
Well, for starters,
They don't have to look at each other.

Chairman Mao taught us as a CCP member
We must stand on CCP's position must stand on CCP's policy position
Today...
I didn't inform leader and let Miss Chun Fen Lee
Leaving her working area visit a guy who reforms of crime through labor
I don't know whether I was wrong or not
But as a CCP member
I promise for Chairman Mao
I'll never make such mistake again
Raining...
Under Chairman Mao's great leading we will step by step with proud and pride
We stand on this political struggle stage
Thanks for the great care to our working class
The great faith...

Worthy?
It's Liu Fen Dou's report
Listen to me
My name is Liu Fen Dou
Chun Fen Lee and me didn't fall in love
Chun Fen Lee took the initiative
I didn't endure that her evil temptation
I made a serious and unforgiving mistake betrayed the party and people who trained and educated me for many years
I must remember Chairman Mao's instruction distinguish enemy and friend
With Chun Fen Lee
I'll make a clear distinction with her Chun Fen

Chairman Mao taught us, people
Only people can establish the history
All the reactionary is paper tiger
If the army lost people then it will lost everything
Never forget class struggle
We come from east and west for a common revolution goal we come together
We must condescend and be cautious guard against arrogance with all our hearts master Cui
Work for the people
Heard this movie was very impressive
We will build a new world
Chairman Mao taught us estimate a young man is revolutionary or not the point is he would like or not deal with or not he will unite with people or not
Chairman Mao is correct
Revolutionary youth must combine with the people make up his mind for the petty bourgeoisie they can't do it
Comity Compact Seriousness Vivacity
My little defect is too serious
Too nervous, not vivacity
Wish long live to our great leader Chairman Mao
Chun Fen, why you keep silence
Master Cui
It's OK.
The movie is too impressive
It's premiere, the film didn't arrive
Please wait for a minute
Chun Fen
We didn't match up
Please forget what I said

It's the precondition of our cooperation

Wake up, Los Angeles!
It's 9:02 A.M. and already 78° on another beautiful September Saturday.
It's definitely gonna be a hot one, boys and girls.
Break out that sunblock when you hit the beach.
So get out of bed and let's get this day started.
Over here.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What...
- What's with all the suits?
- Some big dealer thing.
You got two minutes.
How do you feel?
I'm ready.
You fuckin' better be.
Let's go.
Everybody ready?
Was that a roger, Roger?
Yeah.
- Let's do it.
- Let's bang a gong.
- You're early!
- What?
Get your hands in the air!
Get your hands up!
Oh, fuck.
Shit.
I'm sorry, Mr. Weston.
It's another tough one.
What are you doing here?
You're killing me.
Whoo!
Yeah!
That's like 12 in a row.
That must be some new local record.
Do me a favor?
You know, the next time, if you would, don't hit on 16.
Don't distract the other players.
Oh, there you are, sweetheart.
I thought you might have gotten lost.
Hey, what are you doing after work?
Curing cancer then grabbing a snack.
You know, Chucky, it's the little personal touches that set this place apart from the rest.
Yes, sir.
I have half a mind to stop losing my money at your establishment.
Let's call it a night, Mr. Weston.
Oh, come on, guys.
I was getting on a roll here.
Let's not make a scene.
You know the deal.
You've sort of worn out your welcome for the moment.
I believe you still have some, uh, unfinished business
- with...
- Yeah, I...
It's okay.
It's okay, 'cause I've taken care of all that now, so, if you would just give me... a couple hands here, a chance to win back what I lost...
- Now, Mr. Weston.
- Chuck.
Hey hey!
Ow ow ow!
Ooh!
What the fuck, Chuck?
You have a nice night, Mr. Weston.
Sweetie, it's just two more weeks.
I know.
But what's the...?
Hon... honey?
Okay, honey, in two weeks you'll be able to shop until you drop.
But if we don't put the order in today, they won't have the Aviator chairs back in stock for another month.
Sherry, look, don't get pissed off.
I already explained this to you.
It's just how it has to work.
Roger!
You promised me these types of things
- wouldn't be a problem anymore.
- Listen, Sherry.
Jason just walked in so I'll... we're gonna talk about this later tonight, okay?
Sherry?
Sherry, we'll talk about this later tonight, okay?
I love...
What's up?
That's the problem...
nothing's up.
And nothing's gonna go up.
No shit?
Yeah.
Oh my fucking God.
What the fuck happened?
Check it out yourself.
What the fuck is this shit?
Vinnie, JTS Brown in a bucket.
Paulie, cash, on the bar.
Cold night at the tables?
It's fucking Siberia out there.
But I'm due for a good run.
How's it going?
- Goes in streaks.
- Streaks?
Yeah, streaks.
The last good streak you had was six months ago.
Now you lost all your scratch... you're in debt with these lovely new friends of yours.
I'm gonna pay 'em.
Like you're gonna pay your bar bill?
Hey.
I was up almost 100 grand.
You know Freddie and that whole Valari crew.
You got a deathwish or something?
I can't afford it.
You should have stayed in San Mateo.
Palo Alto.
Whatever it is.
I want to know what keeps you from going back.
It was too much water.
The wife?
Well, ex-wife, I guess.
You are legally retarded.
Aw, you know, seemed like a good idea and all that.
I was finally in a position where I could give her the kind of life that she deserved.
I mean, I was making it.
My friend, you confuse a good run at the blackjack table for Shangri-La.
Now your life depends on whether or not you're gonna take a hit on 16.
Well, what's the dealer showing?
Hey, Vinnie, how about another one?
I'm cutting you off, kid.
Aw, come on, give me a break.
Okay, I'll give you a break... in the form of a tip:
The Valaris have given you more rope than they give most.
And if you don't find a way to pay off these pricks, they're gonna hang you with it.
Jesus, Vin, whatever happened to just plain old "last call"?
Paulie.
That's always brought me luck.
Hey hey, he's on the phone.
Listen, Buster Brown, when I throw a dog a bone,
I don't want to know if it's haute cuisine.
Just eat it and say "Bow-wow."
I don't give a hog's ass what the analysts say.
If you take that deal over mine, you're gonna feel like a gnat fucked by a hippo.
Yeah, well, when your balls clank, call me.
Boys, I'm having a shit day.
My housekeeper didn't wash the socks, hence I have to wear black... with blue.
I'm gauche.
What?
I'm working here.
What?
We were wondering if you noticed that Markable Metals was down 12 points today.
BF deal.
When the merger closes on Monday, it'll go through the roof.
I think you should check your end-of-the-day reports.
- This merger's not closing.
- The hell you say.
Gonad.
As soon as one of these bondholders alerts the SEC that this account is empty, they're gonna be all over us.
They know we manage the fund.
Whoa whoa whoa.
I don't manage it.
You and Ed do.
My name isn't in there as a manager.
I didn't move any money around except for trades.
No, Stephen, you just created the bogus corporation that sold the bogus bonds that we've all been using the bogus profits of.
Besides that, you should be free-and-fucking-clear.
Doesn't matter now who did what to whom.
Once they're onto us, it'll be a matter of nanoseconds before they find out we've been remiss to our bondholders.
So...
So, what do we do?
So you guys get the fuck out of here and leave it to me.
I'll handle it.
But know this:
if MM is really going south... we got ourselves a problem.
I should have been a fucking plastic surgeon.
You should have seen the way he did that.
Just like on TV.
That really smarts, doesn't it?
Getting cold-cocked really fucks you all up.
You get those stars in front of your eyes.
No fun at all.
Freddie?
We have a little problem here, Paulie.
Personally... we feel a little hurt.
Don't we, Bennie?
Downright distraught.
We extend our courtesy to you at my little casino, making your stay in our establishment probably one of the most enjoyable of your time.
Then your luck changes.
You come to us for a loan, we help you out, and how do you repay us?
You don't.
Oh, that's rude.
That's rude.
I'm not finished.
Get him up.
Bennie, stop playing with him.
It's nice to have you back.
I don't have any money.
I never did.
What about your car dealership?
You mean you don't own a car dealership?
No, I never owned it.
I only sold used cars.
Kid, were you born stupid or did you learn it somewhere?
Huh?
Oh oh, God.
He's so cute, isn't he?
Isn't he, Bennie?
Look, we know you have nothing.
We know that you thought you conned us into believing that you were the...
the "Wheel King."
The little "Tire King," yeah?
You were pretty good at first.
As a matter of fact, for about a minute we thought you might be from the Feds.
But... the minute you started to lose and you didn't stop, we knew you were just another punk who thought he was on a good roll.
So, you see, we know the best you might do is some clunker down in Palo Alto.
Oh, yeah.
We know where you come from.
It would take, oh, 20 secondhand cars to make a dent in what you owe.
So... in the course of wondering how we're gonna deal with a little... cheap-shit- wannabe-bigshot little fucker like yourself, we sent a couple of boys down there to see what your situation was... paid a visit to...
Natalie, I believe it is.
- What did you do...?
- Hey.
Do?
Paul, what, you think we're animals?
We're divorced.
Besides, she doesn't have anything.
Oh, yes, she does.
She has that cute little blue house all paid for.
You want her to sell her house?
Oh, no.
You want her to sell the house.
No, I...
I never owned the house.
Oh.
Besides, she won't help me anymore.
But that wouldn't be our problem, would it?
That would be your problem.
However, if you can't deliver, we might be forced to do something... very unpleasant.
Look... you know what?
Fuck it.
You want to kill me, go right ahead.
Fuck it.
You'll be doing me a fuckin' favor.
Tempting, but no.
We wouldn't do that, but we might be forced to... bring the lovely Natalie up here for a visit.
Of course, she would be traveling in a bag of kitty litter.
- If you touch her...
- Hey.
Look...
You can't ask her to sell that house.
That's all she has.
If you have another way of paying for what is mine,
I'm all for it.
However, you have one week... to make things right.
Open it!
Ah... oh!
Shut it.
I know I should say "I hate to do this,"
but I don't.
Fuck.
Shit.
Shit.
Fuck fuck.
You gonna give yourself an aneurysm, Roger.
You got to calm down, son.
That ought to be real easy with you sneaking up on me.
What'd you find out?
Well, our info is kosher.
The merger was all set to close.
But the buyers backed off at the last second due to a new EPA investigation.
Fucking government.
Stock is down 7.5 points.
That's it then.
We're fucked.
Not necessarily.
What do you mean?
What I mean is, until the end of the month, when the statements are generated, nobody but us is hip to the fact that that account is empty, which buys us a little time.
To do what?
To raise the gelt,
Roger... the cash, the loot.
What?
You want to hear it in French?
Well, you know, I really don't have my share of the $5 million, Ed.
Oh, wait, I'll just go run to the ATM and...
We all knew it'd be a gamble, Roger Dodger.
Well, there's a tune change, Eddie.
You know, what happened to the sure thing, huh?
The inside information.
10 times our money in a fucking month?
You know something, Roger?
You haven't had a blow job in so long, you forgot how good it tastes.
You know what this business is.
It's volatile.
It's a risk.
It's never a sure thing, and don't fucking ever...
call me Eddie.
All right.
Relax, Ed.
Jesus.
Relax?
I don't know the etymology of that word, much less its meaning, Rog.
But I do know the meaning of the word "remember,"
as in "recall." Seems to me I recall someone coming to me saying, "Anything you got, Ed, anything you got... under the table, whatever, Ed.
I'm in, Ed!
Sherry's giving me a hard time at home, Ed.
I need the money, Ed."
You're the numbers guy, Rog.
You dig that little syllogism?
"Sherry need money.
Money need Sherry.
Sherry, money, need!"
All right, all right, all right, all right.
I'm sorry, Ed.
Fucking gonad.
Enough.
Things have been real great since the money situation started to improve.
You know?
She just needs a little security.
Women don't need security.
Men only think they do.
Women need three things:
Insurmountable attention, to be licked, and shoes.
Give me the ball.
Look, if we sell now, we're what, three-and-a-half, four million short?
If we're lucky.
Well, that's it, then.
We're fucked.
What if I told you I got a way to raise the cash in less than five days?
I'd say you're fucking nuts.
Have I ever remotely resembled someone to you who's sane?
I'll tell you this though: if we pull it off, get the money back into the account, recall the bond, we're home free.
- Two:
- I'm listening.
Not here, not now.
You call the boys together.
Meet at my house.
I'll explain everything then.
Don't worry, Roger Dodger.
It's all gonna be hunky-dory.
Hunky-dory.
Right.
Fucking gonad.
Yeah, this is Max.
Yeah, Colonel, it's Koster.
Can't you answer the phone?
Yeah?
Damn, Paul, I thought you'd never pick up.
Vinnie?
Word is Freddie and her brother came over to see you last night.
Are you okay?
Define "okay."
Hey, what time is it?
It's just after 2:00.
Do you need a doctor?
More like a welder.
Well, I know somebody in South Lake...
Dr. Charlie Brooks, off State Line Drive.
Can you get there?
Yeah, I think so.
Vinnie, they... they want my wife's house, or they're gonna... they said they're gonna...
God, I can't even say it.
Them motherfuckers.
And what if you were able to come up with the cash right now?
Well, gee, I lost the cash fairy's number.
And Nat's through with me.
She won't help me anymore, not... not that I blame her after what I put her through.
All right all right all right.
There's always a way out.
Look, I'm...
I'm not gambling.
Meet me at the Hit-and-Miss when you're done.
I might have something for you.
I told you, Vinnie, no more gambling.
Well, this ain't gambling.
Hi, I'm Dr. Brooks.
Broken finger.
Did you injure your vocal cords, too?
Aw, sorry.
I...
I was expecting a man.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Why don't you have a seat, please?
So you were in some kind of an accident?
I closed it in a car door.
Car door have a name?
Look, I know you're doing this as a favor for Vinnie, so...
Actually, you know, I would have bought the car door, so I'm gonna put that down.
That's about what it would look like.
And what about your nose?
You have a cold or you always sniffle like that?
It got caught in the door, too.
Burns, doesn't it?
Yeah, okay.
Let's go get you an X-ray.
It's a clean break.
You're lucky it didn't splinter.
You'll have to leave a brace on for the next six weeks.
And put some of this in your nose.
Wow, what is that?
It's a sample.
Keep it.
Here's some painkillers.
You know what?
Here's some more.
Feels better just since you set it.
Yeah, it usually does.
So, were you in the army?
Marines, actually.
But those aren't mine.
They belong to my father.
And where's he stationed?
He's dead.
Is that all right?
Does that feel all right?
No... yeah, that's fine.
What's wrong?
- No, I'm fine.
- Let me look.
More car injuries?
It was a damn big door.
Ow.
Nothing's broken.
It's just bruised.
So, do you need a cab home?
Listen,
I'm a little short on cash.
Well, you're in luck.
Wednesday is free auto-related accident day.
Okay.
Anything else?
No.
Thank you.
I mean it.
Don't mention it.
Say hello to Vinnie for me.
And tell him to stop smoking those damn cigars.
Well...
I'll see you around.
Keep that finger out of harm's way.
Listen, this thing I want to talk to you about...
I think I can help you.
At least I know a guy who can.
Thanks.
What do I have to do?
Knock somebody off?
Listen, Vinnie, I told you no more gambling.
And I told you it has nothing to do with gambling.
But it ain't legal, either.
What are you getting me into?
Look, I know this guy.
He pulls an occasional job now and then.
He's a pro.
Nobody fucking move!
All you cocksuckers on the ground.
He's got something lined up where he needs a fourth man.
Don't even think about calling the cops, you fucking whore.
Get down or I'll blow your fucking head off and they'll be mopping your brains off the goddamn pavement.
Go go go!
Can't move without one.
He's got to move quick.
Wait a minute...
I filled him in.
Says he'll use you on my recommendation.
And your end will take care of your immediate problems... and then some.
This guy is good.
All you have to do is work with him.
Don't get in the way.
Do what he says and everything will be easy.
Gentlemen.
It's paper.
You promised us a toy.
Shit.
I'm a little confused here.
Are we talking about armed robbery?
You're insane.
I can't do that.
You... - you got to be fucking kidding.
I...
I think maybe you've been watching a little too much late-night cable, Ed, but this... this uh... this ain't "The Wild Bunch."
Yeah, give me a T1 line and a keyboard and I'll make sushi out of a Tokyo trader's testicles for lunch.
But this?
No no see, I can't do this.
My boys, it's pretty simple.
The SEC doesn't take kindly to floating phony bonds.
So unless one of you have $5 million stuck away in a shoebox,
I suggest we start organizing and stop bitching.
Stephen, what about your family?
Shit.
Yeah, your dad's worth a fortune.
Oh, what a marvy idea.
Yes, let's call up Stephen's daddy.
I'm sure the senator will appreciate that, especially in an election year.
Yeah, well, I don't think that's gonna work out.
"Hello, Daddy, it's Stephen.
Listen, I was wondering if you could slip me $5 million to pay back grandmothers I bamboozled.
Oh, you can?
Well, goodie, that should about do it.
Bye."
That'll go over like a turd in a punch bowl, brothers.
Plus which, there'd be a paper trail longer than the federal tax code leading from the senator right back to us.
And the SEC and the IRS and the FBI will be following it like smoke out of the ass of a semi.
My way is clean.
My way is complete.
Two weeks from now we're back at our desks making loot.
Now, that's what you want, isn't it?
Make some loot, stay out of jail?
If so, this is the way.
This is the only way.
No, God damn it.
Hey hey.
Sit.
- Sit down.
- Yeah.
Sit the fuck down.
I'm not a thief.
I can't put a gun to somebody's head and say, "Hand it over."
I put my neck on the chopping block for you and you're gonna act this way?
What are you gonna do?
Work it off?
If I have to.
What are you gonna do?
Be a pit boss?
A house manager?
A clarinet player?
Jesus, you got nothing else.
You got nothing left.
You're gonna do what Freddie wants you to.
Offer up your ex's house, maybe even her, or get in on this and settle with Freddie and have something left over.
Personally, I would suggest a down payment on a new life in San Mateo.
Palo Alto.
Listen, if you got a guy on the inside, you know, and he's just gonna hand 'em over anyway, why do we got to put on this big show of robbing the place?
Because my guy ain't in this for the shits and giggles, Roger.
My guy needs a robbery.
He can't just say, "Oops, gee,
I lost $15 million worth of diamonds.
Can you send some more over?"
He needs a robbery with witnesses, with guns, with cops.
Plus which, those diamonds are gonna be in his shop for about two hours before they're allocated and dispersed to the retailers.
So, this ain't an absolute lock.
An absolute lock, Jason?
What, have you been going to Roger's School of the Sure Thing?
No, Jason!
I'm sorry.
I can't come up with a multimillion dollar absolute fucking lock!
Jesus!
You guys absolutely fucking slay me.
We log on, make a few phone calls... two weeks later, 250 geriatrics hand over their entire life's savings and that's okay.
"But gee, Ed,
I don't wanna be a real crook."
We always intended to pay that money back, Ed.
And how were we gonna pay back the money, Stephen?
From the trading account.
And the trading account is what, Stephen?
It's almost empty.
Excuse me?
- Empty.
- Thank you, Stephen.
Your voice was muffled, you had your head so far up your ass.
The trading account is empty, earth people.
Which leads me back to question alpha:
How do we get the scratch?
Which leads me back to plan A.
Speaking of plan A, Ed... not to look a gift horse in the mouth...
Then don't look a gift horse in the mouth, Roger.
What, you think we're the only folks that need a shitload of change yesterday?
My guy's been waiting for something like this a long time.
A long time... except it's very difficult to find folks who will pull it off.
But we can pull it off, see?
This is it.
So grow up!
You got a better plan?
No, you do not.
So, get some balls that clank, and let's get to work.
Alrighty?
I don't know, Vinnie.
I just can't do it.
- Can't do what?
- Play softball.
The bar's forming a league for softball.
Man.
You sure fixed my boy up good.
That's what I do.
May I?
Yes yes.
Let me help you there.
Thanks again for...
for everything.
Yeah, car doors can be hell.
So what brings you here?
I was supposed to meet some friend after their shift change at the Valarian.
I think I got stood up.
Yeah, and I saw my patient over here, and I thought maybe I should check up on him.
So, how are those painkillers working?
Oh, a few more minutes, you might be able to have your way with me.
Why do you think I came over?
Look, I gotta go.
Good to see you again.
Thanks, Vinnie.
Paul?
I need your answer tomorrow by noon, and it better be positive.
Need a ride, cowboy?
Aw, no thanks.
My horse is just around the corner.
Come on, get in the car.
You're full of drugs.
You're gonna kill yourself, or worse, your horse.
That's okay, my horse is sober.
Hey, I am your doctor.
You have to do what I say.
Listen, I'm sorry I laughed at you back there, okay?
Hasn't been my week.
Well, the week's still young.
So, are you enjoying Tahoe?
I guess you must be really having a tough time.
Well, for what it's worth,
I've treated a lot of Vinnie's friends, but you're the first one that I've ever given a ride to.
Ah.
So, out of all the losers, I'm your favorite one.
Without a doubt.
Okay, I gotta ask... so... so why didn't you just take the money and run?
Well, it's nice to know Vinnie can keep a secret.
Why didn't I just take the money and run?
Well, I guess the stock answer to that question is it's not about the money.
It's about the power, the rush.
Okay.
But that's bullshit.
- It is about the money.
- Okay, so...
So, why didn't I just quit while I was ahead?
Ha, 'cause you never know.
The most cash I'd ever seen in my life was $2,500, and it was a commissions check, and that was before taxes.
New Year's Eve, I was sitting behind $95,000.
Now, three days later, it was $80,000.
Now, that's pretty good, but it's not... it's not 95.
And so on, and so on, until it's... it's not just the money you've lost, but it's the job, the girl, the self-respect.
- The girl?
- Oh, yeah, there's always a girl.
Wife, actually.
She became part of all the deals I was making.
Deals?
Deals with who?
Aw, fate, God, whoever.
Natalie, my wife... she just wanted to have a family, and a little house.
That wasn't good enough for me.
I wanted the American Dream, you know?
I was in a dead-end job and I came up here on a whim.
And I just started raking in the money.
It was unbelievable.
Okay, so now you had 80 grand...
No, it was only 60 grand at that point.
Only.
She begged me to stop.
Ah, and I swore that I would.
But I just knew if I had one more good run,
I could get all that money back.
I just knew that I could.
The sad thing was, I was still making deals, even after the money was all gone and she had told me to get lost.
- Well.
- Yeah.
It's pretty damn impressive.
- Hello?
- Colonel Max, it's Koster.
- Are we set?
- Yes, sir, we're all set to come through the door at 0910 hours.
Very good.
Remember that you can be inside no more than two minutes.
That's affirmative, sir.
We're ready.
Ah, my contact is set to get 60¢ on the dollar, and we will rendezvous at the safe house in two weeks.
Alrighty, sounds good to me.
Oh, and Ed, I...
I appreciate this.
I would not ask this of you if there were any other options.
No need to explain, sir.
I can't say I'm not having fun.
Look, you kind of caught me in an off year.
Thanks for the ride.
What, no drink?
I don't have anything here.
I...
I just want to make sure you'll be okay.
Sure.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
Sure.
- It's the best I could do.
- Thank you.
Yeah, I wasn't planning on entertaining tonight.
Make yourself comfortable.
I always do.
So... have you lived in Tahoe long?
About a year.
Do you like it?
Well, take it or leave it.
Was it hard to become a doctor?
Well, you do have to go to medical school.
Hey, I'm sorry I brought up your father.
I...
I didn't mean to.
Oh, no, that's okay.
I'm just still very sensitive.
It hasn't been that long and we were very close.
So, um... so, how long were you married?
A little over three years.
And when did you get divorced?
Couple of months ago.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And you?
Have you ever been married?
No.
No, I never found the right guy.
Oh.
Besides, the... the guys that come into my office... they're usually not my type.
And what is your type?
Hello?
Paul?
Nat, is that you?
It's me.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
You?
How... how did you find me?
Your friends gave me the number.
My friends?
Yeah.
They came by.
They were looking at the house, asking all these weird questions.
Did...
did they do anything?
I thought we were done with all of this, Paul.
You said you'd walk away and leave me alone.
You said that.
I...
I...
I know, I'm...
Nat, did... what did they say?
Listen, don't go thinking you can borrow against the house again.
Look, Nat...
- I'm in...
I'm in trouble.
- No no.
Not again.
My father left me this house so I wouldn't have to worry, and there is no way in hell I am going to let you ruin that.
I...
I'm sorry, Nat...
You...
look, you're in trouble.
Don't start.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
I know.
I've got a new life now.
Time to move on.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You're right, I'll take care of it.
I'll leave you alone.
- I miss you, Nat.
- Don't, Paul.
I wish...
- What?
- Just... take care of yourself.
Sherry?
Honey?
What the fuck?
Sherry?
This is...
Yeah?
Roger?
Hey, it's Jason.
Ah, Jason.
Jason, you know, this really isn't a good time.
Why, what's wrong?
Oh...
You know, I don't know.
I may be in prison inside of a month, and... oh, yeah, my wife... she seems to have left me.
Whoa whoa.
Why?
What happened?
Hell, you know what?
Let's ask Ed.
He seems to have his finger on the pulse of just about fucking everything.
God damn it.
I don't even know what to say.
Did she leave a note?
Took the furniture.
Pretty big clue.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, man, shit.
You know, Ed was right.
Hmm, Ed was fucking right, you know?
I should have seen this coming.
It was always about the money and the lack of it.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck.
She took the big screen!
So what are you gonna do?
I don't know, since this just happened about five fucking minutes ago,
I really have no idea.
Hey, maybe I'll burn the house down, since it usually comes in threes.
So, what good news do you have?
Shit, man...
I don't even want to bring it up now, but Ed wants us to come out to the cabin Friday after work.
You know, planning and all that stuff.
Of course he does.
Have to keep on a tight schedule.
Can you make it?
Hold on.
Let me ask my wife.
Sherry honey?
I have to go meet up with the guys on Friday to talk about this robbery we're planning to get back the money I lost trying to keep you from leaving me.
Okay?
Yeah yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.
Hey hey.
Remember what I told you:
This guy is a pro.
And if you have any second thoughts about getting out, now's the time to do it.
Because once you're in, you're in.
You can't get out of it like a job offer.
One more thing:
the vig is
I get 10% of your in.
'Course you do.
Thank you.
Here's Paul.
Come on.
I'm gonna take a walk outside.
You rolled Freddie Green, and all she did was break your little digit.
Man, are you lucky.
She must really like you, son.
What do you want?
Vinnie said I could get in on a job with you.
What else he say?
He didn't know all the details.
Do you want to know all the details?
Yeah, I want to.
Pretty simple, actually.
If you want in, you're in.
If you want out, that's the door.
And if you fuck up, then I will kill you.
Now, are you in or out?
I'm in.
I like that.
I like that.
You are in.
I like you.
- You've got a shot.
- Hi.
I'm Todd, I'm the wheel man.
Oh, sorry.
Let's start again.
"I'm Todd."
I'm Todd.
"And I'm an asshole."
And I'm an asshole.
And you will not speak again until you are told to speak.
And I will not speak again until I am told to speak.
- "And this is because..."
- And this is because...
"I don't come into a room whenever I want to and introduce myself to people as a wheel man or anything else."
Is that what you do?
You walk into a fucking casino and you say, "Yeah, wheel man on the end.
I fold at 16.
I'm not gonna go for 21.
I fold at 16.
I just wanted you to know that's what I do."
You're a fucking asshole.
You know, this sucks.
- Huh?
- I mean, Jesus Christ.
I mean, look at us.
We drove all the way up to a cabin to practice for a robbery, when we should be fucking playing golf, man.
Yeah, it's a little over our heads.
But, it is a way out, man.
Yeah.
Let's talk about that.
Doesn't it seem a little odd to you?
- What?
- Ed.
Look, he... he got us into this, and what?
It takes him what, about a whole day to figure out a way out?
Isn't that just a little too convenient?
Huh?
It's almost like he wanted this investment to go south.
Yeah, but why?
I don't know.
Maybe to give himself permission to do something exactly like this.
Come on, Roger, don't you think you're reaching just a little bit?
Maybe, but you got to admit, man, he's a little too much into that army shit.
It's like time stood still the day he was fucking discharged.
All right, I'll give you that.
But he's also the sharpest manager we've ever seen, man.
Maybe he just feels guilty.
For what?
Huh?
His wet dream come true?
No, for dragging us into this thing.
I mean look, you got to remember, it was his idea and his inside info that went bust.
Look, all right, Stephen and I, we've been talking.
He's willing to go to his father if we're willing to turn ourselves in.
Turn ourselves in?
Man, Ed will never go for that.
I'm not sure I would either.
I mean, we should at least think about it, considering the alternative plan.
How the fuck did I get into this?
Shit.
We go in a little after 9:00 A. M...
Shipment arrives at exactly 9:00.
South Africa ships its diamonds quarterly.
West Coast diamonds come in at one location, then all the dealers in the area show up to claim their allotments.
The first set of dealers arrive at 9:30 A.M. sharp.
That's why we have a small window of time before the rest of the dealers arrive, to divvy up the stones.
Should be worth about 15 mil.
Fuck me.
What about security?
That's the beauty of it...
only two security guys.
The thing of it is, nobody knows about this except the dealers, and the location changes each time.
Won't there be a lot of people around the area?
It's the jewelry district on a Saturday.
Downtown L.A. is practically a ghost town on weekends.
So no customers?
No customers.
Just the security guys and employees that work in the store.
It's as easy as it gets... couple of guys, one satchel to carry the goods.
We go in, hit 'em hard and fast... piece of cake.
We're in, we're out.
We're in the clear.
Thing of beauty.
How do you fence stolen diamonds?
You don't.
You get your share when it's over and you're done.
How long will I have to wait for my money?
You won't.
I'll pay it.
How do you even know that the diamonds will be there?
Son... you ask a lot of fucking questions, I'll tell you that.
We got a man on the inside.
Speaking of the man on the inside...
You're prompt like this on gameday, it's gonna be easier than I thought.
What the fuck is this?
The doctor here is the reason we're all here.
She's our man on the inside.
She's the one that guarantees that the diamonds will be there, and for that she gets a cut.
Look, I know I'm up shit creek already, but I got to be honest with you.
This looks like a fucking joke.
Vinnie told me you'd done this before.
I'm sorry, but this doesn't look like the ideal team to pull off a big-time diamond robbery.
What makes you think I'm a joke?
Answer me!
Look...
I don't have much experience with this.
And you said that she doesn't, and he doesn't look like he has much experience.
So, you know, if you're such a professional, why don't you just pull this job yourself?
I would do it by myself if I happened to be lucky enough to have six God damn eyes.
But I don't.
How do you think this shit gets done?
You don't do it alone.
It is not about the team.
It's about the fucking plan.
Now, if we all stick to the plan, it should be pretty God damn easy.
Why the hell are you here, anyway?
It's none of your business.
In other words, son, she's got her fucking reasons, just like you do, and I've got that covered.
Yeah, right, of course, because you...
you're the professional.
You know what that is?
You know what it does?
If there is any problem here... most decidedly, it will kill you.
Gene, Gene.
Calm down.
It's okay.
Okay, he's just never done this before.
Maybe he just needs to know why we're so sure we can do it.
Enlighten him.
Now.
I used to work at this place in med school.
All you need to worry about is that I know this place inside and out.
And I know all about this shipment.
They've been planning it for nearly four years now.
It's the goddamn Diamond Olympics we're talking about.
Now, let's get to work, okay?
Just think of this as robbery camp.
Look, Ed...
The truth is, this is up your alley, not mine.
I've never even held a gun.
Now you have.
I have no desire to learn how to use this thing.
And I have no desire to go to the joint for a decade.
But life's a bitch, so pay attention.
Put your left hand on the forestock, the grip.
Put your right hand on the trigger.
Easy.
Hold it away from you.
Steady.
Put it out from here.
Hold it tight.
Remember it's an automatic, so fire in short bursts.
And try to relax.
Jesus Christ.
Do you see?
This is ridiculous.
I told you, I cannot do this.
We'll work on it.
Work on it?
I don't want to work on it!
There's got to be another way to get out of this.
I'm open to suggestions.
Look, if you're really going through with this, I'll help you plan it.
But there is no way I can go on the actual job.
Stephen, to tell the truth, I'd rather have a case of the Manila clap than have you on this job, but if I'm gonna get dirty, you're gonna get dirty.
I just think that we're getting in too deep.
Too deep?
What about passing $5 million in phony paper?
That fucking deep enough for you?
We're first-time offenders.
Maybe... maybe we'll just get probation or something.
You gonad, don't you read the news?
White-collar crime is about as popular as plane-jacking, and they ain't gonna send us to Club Fed.
They're gonna probably reopen Alcatraz just for us, and five minutes in a joint like that ain't worth it.
And you're such a cutie, Stevie, you probably won't last the night.
Yeah.
Well, maybe we're willing to take that chance, Ed.
Take the chance, huh?
So, let me get this straight:
world according to Stephen is, we turn ourselves in and face the music, right?
Seems that way, Ed.
You fucking feather-merchants.
Don't you see what he's pulling here?
Of course he can take that chance, because his family's gonna fix it for him.
What?
Your dad's got a couple of judges in his pocket, Stephen?
Well, that's just peachy, but come court time, folks, it's gonna be us three over here, looking over there at Stevie and Daddy, and a couple of congressmen and 15 or 20 lawyers.
If I wanted that, I wouldn't be here.
Right, Ed, you know?
He would have rolled over on us by now.
He is gonna roll over on us, champ.
What are you talking about?
You got into this for the thrill, Stephen.
You never thought you'd get hurt because you're Senator McKinley's son.
Ease up, Ed.
Joyboys like you never do an honest day's work.
Fat boys like you...
senators' sons, you never serve your country.
You just hide behind your fat daddy and his fat bank books, right?
Well, not on my time, punk!
- Jesus fucking...
- Fuck this.
Where you going, brother?
What the fuck are you doing?
How's this feel, rich boy?
Daddy ain't here.
It's just you and me and 10 rounds.
Take it easy, Ed.
Fuck easy.
Ed, Ed, be cool, man.
All right, be cool.
He's just a little scared.
You know, we're all...
we're all a little shaky right now, but you got it all planned out.
No one's gonna get hurt.
And Stephen...
Stephen's gonna be right there for us.
Right there.
You're gonna be right there, aren't you, Stephen?
Yeah yeah yeah.
I'll be right there.
See, we're...
we're with you.
We're all with you.
I'll be God damned.
Well, I guess I better use the old facility.
You want something to eat?
Yeah, get me a box of Jacks.
You know, the one with the toy in it.
A Coke... the 16-oz cup.
Pour some ice in it.
Why don't you get something for everybody?
Okay.
Yeah, it's important that we keep our strength up for co-ed armed robbery.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, does that mean you have done this before?
'Cause I was thinking maybe we could buddy up.
You could show me the ropes...
who to shoot, what to say,
- all that stuff.
- What is your problem?
You have been giving me attitude ever since Tahoe.
I'm sorry, I didn't know lady-jewel-thief doctors were so sensitive.
What do you want to know?
What?
What, what's a nice girl like me doing, blah-blah-blah?
Yeah, I want to know what a doctor is doing mixed up with a guy like Gene.
He was the wrong guy at the right time.
I don't see you asking Gene why he's doing it.
He's a scumbag thief.
I know why he's doing it.
I know why I'm doing this.
I...
I don't think Todd would know if you told him.
Yeah, so what?
Well, I'm here because I have to be here.
You're a doctor.
Why the hell are you here?
You don't need it.
God.
Oh, you think you're the only one with problems?
I have my reasons.
I know why I'm doing it.
Okay, and it's none of your business, anyway.
Look, I just want to come out of this alive...
- Fine.
- and I want to get myself square.
- Okay.
- Okay?
You went out of your way to set me up, and that tells me you might not want me to come out of this at all.
How could I possibly set you up?
Ha, a little free medical care, a little sex.
You do the math.
How can you say that?
I was just supposed to check you out.
What happened between us had nothing to do with the plan.
In that bathroom stall I was just in, a guy had written on the wall, carved with a knife, you know...?
"I am 10 inches long, and 4 inches wide.
Are you interested?"
And another guy answered him back, saying, "I'm fascinated.
How big is your cock?"
We gotta roll.
Come on.
But it was interesting.
I went to fucking Princeton.
Calm down.
Ed's fucking losing it, huh?
We're in some deep shit here.
Gone from fraud to armed robbery, to murder one.
What the fuck is planned for tomorrow?
It's actually murder two, or manslaughter, since there was no intent.
Intent?
Fuck you.
That's it.
I'm out.
Huh.
You're both fucking crazy.
- Roger.
- Fuck you.
Roger.
Have a water.
Have another one.
He doesn't have to stay, but he ain't leaving.
Ed, what the fuck, man?
Just... just give me a minute with him.
Just give me a minute.
And I came bearing gifts.
Rog...
Roger!
What?
Fuck you.
Leave me alone, man.
This is so fucked up, Jason.
We were supposed to be worth fucking millions by now, huh?
- I can't do this.
- Calm down, man.
Think!
Huh?
What are you gonna do?
Go back to your wife?
Go back to work?
Just go trade some fucking stocks and wait for the marshal to show up?
Come on, man!
We're in this... to the end.
I'm sorry about Stephen.
I am.
But the truth of the matter is, we're better off without him.
Ed killed him.
- Sure a jury's gonna agree with that?
- Bullshit.
"Your Honor, I just had the gun in my hand, that's all.
And if Roger didn't come up and bump my arm, little old Stephen would still be alive today."
Fuck you!
Guys, I'm just trying to stay out of jail here, all right?
Stephen's dead, and that's it.
He's gone.
You guys want to quit, you walk off this hill right into the joint.
Okay, don't you think that people... all right, his parents... are gonna realize that Stephen is gone?
What the hell are we gonna do about that?
Shit.
As far as I'm concerned, last time I saw Stephen was Thursday when he walked out of my office.
So we ditch his car...
there's nothing to tie him to us.
Look, my boys, 9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning, my man's gonna be there.
So are those diamonds.
You want out?
Fine.
You want in?
Get your butts off this porch and help me finish this thing.
Fuck fuck.
No affairs of the heart tonight.
Fair enough?
I want you to be tough, like me... no heart.
You will have absolutely no heart tomorrow.
You gotta be tough.
- Promise me?
- Yeah.
- Okay, kid.
- You're right.
Okay?
You're right, yeah.
Look, I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
You're right.
You got your own reasons for doing this and I got mine.
That's right.
It's not such a bad view of the city for such a shitty room.
You want to know the real reason why I didn't quit while I was ahead?
It's none of your fucking business.
That's right.
Are you nervous about tomorrow?
I'm terrified.
I hate this town.
Morning.
- Exciting day.
- You said it.
Over here.
- Good morning.
- How you doing?
What's with all the suits?
Some big dealer thing.
All you motherfuckers down on the floor.
Get down, you!
Open your mouth!
- Get down.
...very gently.
- Drop your gun!
- Gently, gently.
- Get down, get down!
- On your knees, on the floor.
- All the way down.
- I want help.
The diamonds, where are they?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You fuckin' liar, where are the diamonds?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are the diamonds?
You lie, you die.
Give me the fucking jewels.
- I've got 'em.
- Give me the fucking jewels.
Over here.
- So you know where they are?
- Yeah.
That'd be very nice.
How's about you get 'em for me before I blow your fuckin' head off?
Get 'em out!
That's it.
Thattaboy.
- You're early.
- What?
Shut the fuck up!
- Let's do it.
- Let's bang a gong.
Fuck, Ed.
What was that, man?
Holy shit.
Fuck, Ed.
It's about fucking time, Ed.
Hurry.
Hurry.
What the fuck?
Drive.
Drive!
Get down!
- Just keep driving.
- What the hell's going on?
Who are you people?
What the fuck just happened?
This way, hoss.
Alrighty.
Okay, right there!
Everybody put your hands in the air!
Put your hands up!
Oh, fuck!
Well, ain't this a real box of Mars Bars?
Okay, Sasquatch, give me the rocks.
I said, give me the rocks!
- Now!
- Fuck you!
Damn it.
Who the fuck are they?
Do I remotely resemble a goddamn crystal ball?
Shit!
Get over by that door.
What?
I said, get over by the door and we will get them in a crossfire.
Fuck you, Rambo.
I'm outta here.
Get up.
Ed, I'm fucking shot, man.
So am I. Get up.
Get up.
Ed, just give me a minute.
Pussy.
Son of a bitch.
Where'd Charlie go?
What the fuck?
Get the hell outta here!
Whoa... now, hey.
Take it easy.
I mean, that's not what you're looking for.
Where are the diamonds?
Give me your gun.
Give me your gun, God damn it!
They want to flank us.
No, here, take these.
Cops, cops!
There's cops!
Shit!
God damn it.
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!
Charlie!
This is LAPD!
We have the building surrounded.
Shit.
Just one.
Throw out your weapons, release the hostages and come out with your hands up.
This is your final warning.
If you do not comply, we will storm the building.
About fucking time.
Hurry, hurry.
- What the fuck?
- Drive!
What the fuck is this?
Oh, fuck!
- Ah!
- Shut up!
Holy shit!
Okay, what the fuck just happened?
This is your last chance!
Come out with your hands up!
Semper fi, motherfuckers.
Shit.
Who the fuck are you people?
What the hell just happened?
What the fuck was that?
Yeah, what was that, Charlie?
Your private little thing's suddenly become extremely public knowledge.
- Meaning?
- Meaning that you said that nobody'd know those diamonds were supposed... supposed to be there, but us.
I've seen people cover their asses in my life, but that was fucking ridiculous.
Oh-ho!
Gene, you are clever.
No, you found me out.
Yeah yeah.
I knew you'd fuck up so I got those guys to hit the same place at the same time, and shoot at me just to make me look good!
Excuse me, excuse me.
Shut the fuck up.
Who are you?
Um, I'm uh... um...
Gene, you're bleeding.
I know.
I took one, but I think it went all the way through.
I think I got lucky.
Pull over.
I got to take a look.
This car's not stopping until we can dump it.
What do you mean, dump the car?
No, you're losing a lot of blood.
Every goddamn cop in the city knows this car by now.
Don't worry, kid.
We need a new wheel man.
Fuck this fuckin' economy.
Can you believe it?
You gotta stand in line to pull a job now.
How pathetic is that?
What are we gonna do now?
Turn ourselves in.
How's about we do that?
No, I mean, where are we gonna go?
Every cop in L.A. is gonna be after us now.
Everything's the same, except I'm bleeding... to hell all over myself, and we picked up... this rather pathetic person.
- I'm Rog.
- Everything's the same.
I'm still the same.
I'd say the plan just went to shit, Gene.
Where'd Charlie go?
Shut up.
Where are the diamonds?
Charlie?
What are you doing here?
Over there, on your knees.
Charlie, I don't understand.
Where you been?
Where...
Get over there and get down on your knees.
Oh...
Oh, Charlie...
Charlie, I...
I don't understand.
What?
There was no robbery last year.
What?
Max...
I was there that day.
Yeah.
Charlie, I never meant for him to get involved.
Shut up.
Charlie, I swear, I never meant for him to get hurt.
- I never meant for him to get hurt!
- Shut up!
- Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up!
- I always loved him, Charlie.
Yeah, fucking right, you did!
I see how you loved him!
They didn't want Dad.
They came after you because you owed them money.
Please, Charlie.
Please.
Fuck fuck...
I'm sorry.
I watched my father die.
And it should have been you.
It should have been you.
Fucking shoot me, then.
Shoot me.
Charlie!
Shit.
Come on.
We're gonna try out back.
Don't forget those.
Come on, go on!
It's no big deal!
Come on!
The plan has not gone to shit, Charles.
We've got our diamonds, the bad guy is dead, and now it's caused friction.
- I didn't want him dead.
- It sure looked like you did.
Who was that guy?
What the fuck was going on back there?
Maybe it's time that... the doctor here comes clean.
Shut up, Gene.
Did you know that... we just ripped off
Daddy's little jewelry store?
Would someone mind telling me what the fuck you two are talking about?
That man was my father's partner.
He got himself in some trouble, and my father was killed.
Any other questions?
Was... was I in line for a murder rap all along?
Excuse me.
Somebody mind telling me where the fuck we are going?
Ever heard... of the Salton Sea?
The Salton Sea?
Gene, that's over 100 miles from here.
Even I can tell you're not gonna make it like that.
He's right.
I got...
we gotta pull over.
I have to close you up.
This car will not stop... until I am out of L.A. County.
You got that?
How's it look?
Not good.
Look, uh, I know that this is an inopportune time, but I...
I have to ask him.
- What about me?
- What about you?
Well, you know, I have been of some help to you guys, right?
I'd like to know now if I'm cut in on this thing or if the big guy there is just gonna put a bullet in my head once we get to the "Salty Sea,"
or wherever the hell it is that we're going, because if that's the case, hey, I'd soon as hell just leave right now.
Okay, could you please just be quiet?
I mean, I realize that you guys wouldn't want to take a smaller cut than you're intended, which is why I would consider a smaller share than the rest of you.
I mean, hey, I'm willing to see this thing through.
I really... really don't have many options.
Oh, please...
But I do think that we should come up with a percentage now,
- before...
- Jesus.
I mean, that way I'll know exactly what I'm getting paid for...
Okay, you know, who asked you to talk?
I mean, who are you, anyway?
- I'm...
I'm Rog...
- Please, just shut the fuck up!
Hey, Jesus, Charlie, take it easy.
The guy's life just went to shit today with the rest of us, so let's...
let's just take it easy and work this thing out.
Yeah, take it easy.
Hey, shut the fuck up.
So, what the fuck are we gonna do?
'Cause this thing is a lot sloppier than we planned.
Sloppy?
I thought this was all part of your grand plan.
- Fuck you!
- All right, listen.
Just slow down.
All right, look, I've seen the shit hit the fan myself in the last couple of days.
No point in arguing now.
Okay, fine.
What are we gonna do about him?
He's a loose cannon.
Yeah, you know how to hear that.
I knew one myself till this morning.
If I had to do it again,
I would have just dropped him off and left him there.
That might not be a bad idea.
- What?
- What?
He's not gonna make it anyway.
What, you want to just leave him here?
It's gonna be hard to move the body and not get caught.
What are you saying?
Okay, are you the doctor here?
No.
He's practically dead, so either here or sometime in the car, we're gonna get rid of the body.
- We can't do that.
- Why not?
- 'Cause he's a person.
- You do not know him.
If that was you laying there instead of him, we would not be having this conversation.
He would leave you face down in a ditch a long time ago.
One way or another,
this dame... just plain gets it.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.
What did you do?
You killed him.
You fucking shot him!
Okay, who the hell are you people?
You... bitch!
He was gonna kill us.
Bullshit, how?
By bleeding on us?
What was she supposed to do?
You ever hear of a hospital?
Oh, yeah.
We just pulled an armed robbery.
We got a gunshot victim here, huh?
What... what hospital do you suggest we go to?
No no no.
You know what?
You're right.
Let's just shoot him.
Why the fuck didn't I think of that, huh?
Can I shoot him some, too?
Give me a gun, any gun.
Hey, how about that one?
I wanna get in on the action.
You know, he might not be quite dead.
Look, I think I just saw him move.
Please!
Let me shoot him!
Motherfucker!
Shoot him.
Shoot him, Paul.
Shoot him, Paul.
Come on...
it can be just you and me.
Shoot him.
We can start fresh, have new lives.
Shoot him.
Kill him, God damn it!
I...
I can't.
I can't.
Oh!
Fucking figures.
No wonder you wife left you.
Have you ever done anything right in your entire pathetic little life?
Have you ever had any fucking balls?
Charlie.
That was giving me a headache.
Yeah, me, too.
She sure has a set of pipes on her, huh?
Yeah, dead ones.
Vinnie?
What...
What are you...?
Why?
What?
Why'd I do her?
I know her.
The bitch can shoot.
What are you doing here?
Do you think Freddie's gonna send an amateur gambling junkie to do a $15 million heist without any insurance?
You think she wanted your old lady's house.
She wants her goddamn diamonds.
Freddie.
Hey.
Do you know this guy?
You think Gene was here on his own?
He's been Freddie's boy for years and years.
All this was Freddie.
You know him?
- You set me up?
- "You set me up?"
I'm your Mother fucking Teresa.
You're clear for Freddie now.
- And who the fuck are you?
- I'm uh...
Do you know Freddie, too?
I can't believe you two guys are still living.
I can't figure that out.
Who the fuck is Freddie?
Get over there 10 steps.
Take 10 steps now.
Go.
Now go.
Washed-up-white-trash motherfucker.
I'll tell you: next time you pick a better crew, you understand me?
- You understand?
- Yeah.
I wish I had me a piece of the action there.
I tell you right now, that's sad.
She was a hell of a doctor.
I remember when she pulled that bullet out of me.
She didn't ask any questions.
Yeah, even though it was a fucked-up job, it would still be good to have a piece of ass to remember this by.
I'm sure she was worth it.
Huh, Paul?
You know, Bennie,
I think Paulie had a little thing for Dr. B.
That's okay, Paul.
I know she loved you very deeply.
Like I told you, kid, true loser right there.
Time to settle up some loose ends.
Pretty boy, you're up first.
Vinnie.
See that?
Paul's pointing a gun at me.
Paul?
You're not gonna shoot me.
You don't got the nuts.
Damn it.
Son of a bitch!
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
Could you hold this?
God.
I hate margaritas.
Margaritas?
Huh?
Probably get a good price for these down in Mexico.
Mex...
Mexico?
Probably...
live on Easy Street.
Maybe not that easy.
Boy, you can say that again.
I'm Paul.
Roger.
Nice to meet you, Roger.
Yeah, you too.
This is a restricted area
No filming here
Show me an order, please
It's enough that I say so
- No, it isn't
I said stop filming!
Hey, watch it
Hands off, please
Sir, sir!
A bus
Make them stop, then come to the bus
Stay alert.
You're pissing me off
Whatever
Come on, everybody off
Quickly, we don't have all day
Everybody get in two lines
All the men pull your shirts up slowly
You can't film here.
- Really?
Says who?
It's not up to me you heard the officer
I'm sorry you can't just censor us like this
Whatever.
I don't care
Next
Good
Next
I said slowly, so I can see
Next
You with the belly show me what you have there
I don't understand.
what does he want?
Let him see your belly
Don't you understand?
Do as he says
Good
- Fuck them.
- Stay calm, Jihad
Now take out your ID's and move on
Help us, please!
Her water broke she needs help.
Please
Call an ambulance!
Tell her I'm a medic, I can help
He's like a doctor
Don't be scared
Send an ambulance
There's a woman in labor here
She can't breathe!
Relax
- Where's the ambulance?
The ambulance is coming
Don't be afraid
Reassure her.
- I did
Ask her where it hurts
Where does it hurt?
The pain is terrible!
What is he doing?
Where is the doctor?
Stop it, you're scaring her
How long for the ambulance?
The doctor's here
What's going on?
- She's in labor
Hello, I'm the doctor
Don't worry, I'll take care of you
The baby's coming legs first
Push, push, help me!
Push.
Push!
- Help me.
Harder.
Harder
One more push and he's out
- One more, one more
He's out!
Something is wrong
Where is my son?
She wants the baby.
- Give him CPR
Pulse?
- No
OK, starting CPR
I'm sorry
He has no pulse
There is nothing we can do
You killed that baby!
You killed him!
Have you no shame?
Enough of that, Jihad
- Stay out of it
Don't you even care?
Everybody back in line
Nothing happened here
Back in line
Get your IDs ready
come on
"The Third Ear"
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Do you have the new Britney compilation?
Who's that?
It's called "My Prerogative"
And the DVD too
What's a "Prerogative"?
It's her new video.
She's got blond hair
Don't know it
How about the new Roll ing Stones set?
Open your ears a bit
Yeah, right
Let's get out of here
Bad time there?
Yes?
I like the atmosphere here
No uniforms, chilled-out waiters
I think I'll fit in perfect
I've been here a few times
Sometimes it takes half an hour to get a table, but it's worth it
The sweet potato pancakes and the rice pilaf!
I know the owners are girls so all the waiters are boys...
But that's so over
Why pass on a girl like me?
I ran a bar in Netanya, but I don't mind starting from the bottom
In two months I'll be running the place
But I run the place
- We'll run it together.
No problem
Or I can open a branch at the Azrieli Mall
I was there yesterday.
They don't have one
We're not a franchise.
There's only this branch
So think big!
Golan is here now!
The last one wasn't bad
That small-town boy?
You can't be serious.
He's so not our type
Maybe it's time to change our type
Don't all our waiters look like brothers?
That's a thought
Yali, if you like him, then date him
But don't lecture us, OK?
What's up?
- Our soldier's back
It's him?
- Yeah
I need a few minutes.
- Take your time.
I'm here
So, what's new here?
What about your new guy?
- What about him?
No progress
I haven't even seen him yet
Why should it progress?
Has the world progressed?
It actually has.
- No, it hasn't
All guys want the morning after is to run
They don't want any baggage or commitment
The only way to avoid that is to take it slow
So when the male instinct whispers
"Run, she's clinging!"
He'll remember those walks on the beach and the movies we saw and maybe he'll reconsider and stick around
How long have you been holding out?
- Three weeks
Isn't three weeks taking it a bit too slow?
I don't know why Sharon has this effect on you
Miss "Israeli Carrie Bradshaw"
But if you want to keep him it's time to give it up
Really?
And the guys on your reserve duty?
Nothing to tell
- No one?
No sexy suicide bombers?
Don't start
I won't go back, I swear
Hi, Sharon...
Busy?
An editorial meeting?
Nothing special
Why don't you come over tonight?
Yes, my place
You've been wanting to, right?
Maybe we could rent a DVD
No, I don't really feel like going out
Why?
Oh, my roommates?
Going to Sinai
They're going to Sinai
Israeli Pop Idol
I can't believe you're watching that crap
Don't exaggerate
We're not really going
Call my mother tell her you like the food
She brought it just for you
You look great!
Time to go!
- In a second.
- You can't stay
Just to see Mr Editor
Noam is dying to
No
I found your ID
I thought you might need it
I didn't notice, thank you
Come in
My roommates
Yali, Lulu.
This is...
I'm Ashraf
Ashraf was with me on duty
I mean, that's where we met
What's up?
Is this a bad time?
We're just the roommates
I'm Yali.
This is Noam
And that's Ashraf
Ashraf?
Nice to meet you all
Weren't you in a hurry, boys?
You might miss your bus
Yali, we're going for cash first
Meet us by the Eilat platform
I'll just be a second...
I forgot my snorkel
Tel Aviv, Ashraf
Ashraf, Tel Aviv
The sea is over there but you can't see it
The European idiots who built the city in the s didn't know much about the Mediterranean
They put its back to the sea
Streets run parallel to the sea and block the breeze
Then the tall hotels blocked everything
That's why there's no air
Are you sweating?
I'm sweating
I'm really sweating
Maybe Yali packed those towels he stole from the gym
So that's how Jews kiss
Don't you like it?
Sure I do
But I thought we could...
Take it farther?
Yeah, take it farther
Golan?
Great shirt
Yes, I know
So many fags
- Problem?
I hate them
I'm gay.
I'm not a girl
We're all free
They like being feminine
Are you joking?
Who wants to be a biter?
A biter?
Pillow biter...
Never heard that?
So you're a fudge packer?
Just joking
Don't be so touchy
So naive
What are these?
I designed them
They're nice
- Just T-shirts for my friends
But I'm actually serious about fashion design
I'm thinking of studying in New York next year
New York is the best
- So I've heard
Maybe I'll go to Paris
Albert Elbaz started in NY, got famous and then moved to Paris to become the designer for Lanvin
But he's some kind of genius, isn't he?
And you think I'm not?
Of course you are
I'm sure you can make it
There are so many talented people in Tel Aviv
All you need is to get out into the world and make a name for yourself
What's wrong?
Nothing
So why do you look scared?
What are you afraid of?
- You, kind of
You're scared of me?
Never mind, forget it
Forget it?
forget it
So, that's how Arabs do it
Don't you like it?
Sure I do
I just thought maybe we could take it farther
It was awful
Us?
Didn't you...
Not us
That woman at the checkpoint
Lots of stories like that
Jihad, the guy near me at the checkpoint...
He's engaged to my sister
His father had a heart attack
His ambulance was stopped at checkpoint
They searched it
They held it for an hour
He died at the hospital entrance.
If they hadn't stopped him...
You know why they have checkpoints?
They weren't always there
Don't start your propaganda
Forget politics
You thought I said we were awful?
- Maybe
We were explosive!
Explosive?
Don't you know that word?
I know it.
When you explode something, like a bomb
It can mean cool, too
Explosive, explosion, explode
Good sex is explosive
Explosive
No Sharon for breakfast?
- He went spinning before work
Morning spinning.
What a catch!
Delicious!
People forget how sexy a simple sliced tomato can taste
My battery's out
Can I use your phone?
Sure
Thanks
Is he staying?
Where can he go?
He has no permit
If he's caught, they'll arrest him and send him back
Are we going to keep him in the closet?
Stop it
Being gay isn't easy over there
I don't want to stay
I won't marry Jihad's cousin
Why are they pushing me?
Take it easy
Where are you now?
In Jerusalem, at a friend's house
They'll kill me if they find out
What?
Who will kill you?
Are you mad?
Who is she anyway?
Do I know her?
She's a Christian... and a divorcee
Does she have kids?
- Kids?
No, no
So how are you doing?
I miss you
- I miss you too
Don't worry we'll see each other soon
I took my last exam today
I'm leaving Jordan in a few days
Are you sure about him?
He's become so extreme
He could cause trouble for us
Listen, he's the man I love
Jihad is a sensible guy
He promised to stop soon
After the wedding, we'll be far from all that, here in Jordan
What are you doing?
I'm reminding you
"The roommates agree to uphold a strict guest policy
"A hook-up lasting more than one week...
"Hoping there wouldn't be such a case...
"This would require the approval of all roommates
"Maximum stay is two weeks
" nights, then he must go."
Yali, all we ever do is talk
How many times did we promise my mom we'd go to Checkpoint-Watch?
This is a chance to do something important
Is this a political affair?
Stop it!
We can help someone
OK!
I won't be accused of killing the Israeli left
I surrender!
Good
What do you think awaits a gay suicide bomber in heaven?
Seventy virgin twinks or seventy muscle hunks?
Think he can choose?
Golan, I'm really sorry
Orna owes this guy a favor
I know what I said yesterday
I'm really sorry
Someone leaves every month
You're next on the list
No, I just said hi to the security guard
"Orna Ella"
Another date?
Let's talk later
Do you have the Pop Idol CD?
Of course.
How could we not?
There, on the right
See what hours on Sheinkin St can do?
You're a new man!
Probably got some last night...
Does it show?
- Good for you, man
Can I help you?
- Not right now, thanks
Hey, what's up?
Still in the editorial meeting?
OK, later.
No problem
This color is so Arabic
Smells Arabic too
Excuse me, what's in this soap?
Don't you like it?
Sorry, I don't
Our policy is only great-smell ing soaps
Customers aren't allowed to criticize our soaps
I don't like your tone
That soap smells better than you do
How dare you!
Who do you think you are?
I apologize She didn't mean that
Let's get out of here
I need some fresh air.
- Take your time, chill
Hey sweetie!
Hi
Chiki's in the house wipe off the sour face
I have to get out of there
I'm wasting time
That job isn't forever
Never mind
The bastard is screening my calls!
- What?
Nothing, forget it
Look at the cool stickers we made
Can I stick one here?
- No, crazy!
Outside, or they'll think I did it
"Rave Against the Occupation"
Cool, it's better with the sleeves rolled up
Are you sure?
Do these colors work?
He has to dress right to work at the caf?
Orna and Ella don't know the truth
He needs a belt
He also needs a new name and a whole new biography
Wow, this belt looks great
Don't move
I always had fantasies about George Michael
I had fantasies about the entire wall
You liked George Michael?
Who did you fantasize about at?
River Phoenix, Morrissey
Chris Lowe from the Pet Shop Boys...
There were a lot
Him and that sad little indie world of those suffering singers!
Jerk!
You love what I play
And the minute you leave he puts on "Take That"
Jason Orange!
Jason Orange the sweet hard-ons of high school
Jason, the sweet dancer
I was so in love with him
When they broke up I wanted to go to London and find him
Wait a minute who did you like in "Take That"?
Robbie, of course
And you?
You're such an awful snob!
Actually we're missing a picture of Michel Foucault to replace Stephen from Boyzone.
- Shut up
What's wrong?
A little culture some tradition...
We're all one people that way, at least
I can't wear that
That's much better
My clothes work best on him
But there's not much to choose from
Ashraf, follow me
My dear, I sense your mood is not fabulous but I can make it better
Allow me to interest you in my new script
It's a fascinating story.
- I'd be delighted
I know you are writing the part just for me
No other actress in town could play such a role
Waiter!
One second
Stick close to me and repeat everything I say
Good evening
No, no...
That's exactly what we don't do
Be casual
Thank you very much, you're sweet.
What's your name?
Oh, what should we call him?
He needs a Hebrew name
I worked for an Israeli contractor
He gave us all Hebrew names
He called me Shimi
Shimi, like Shimon, right?
Or short for Samson
"Let my soul die with the Philistines"
History's first suicide bomber
Stop it
Why not?
I am Shimi
Want some Kebab, Hummus, Tehina?
How come you don't have an accent?
No problem, if you want
I bring it right back
I take your picture?
We no habe work, no habe money we just want the beace, really
I didn't mean that, you know
It's OK.
It's really unusual
When I was young I worked at my uncle's souvenir shop in Jerusalem
We had Jewish customers so I learned
I thought it might be useful
My uncle used to joke "this one talks like a Jew, that's no good"
You must try our famous sweet potato pancakes
Here are the shirts
Alright people, let's sit down
We have a lot to discuss
Be careful with the chairs
I promised we'd leave this place in good shape
The slave labor arrives at 5 AM to clean up anyway
Don't start arguing
Yes, let's save the arguments for another time
Ladies and Gentlemen The Plan
We leave Tel Aviv in a convoy of cars
We'll drive up toward Tel-Baruch Beach
And make our way to the rave location!
Question
What about the pol ice?
- I don't think we'll have any trouble
The police only look for raves in the desert
They came last time they could come again
If they show up this time we must fight back
Fight back!
Hold on
Now my idea for the poster
"Rave Against the Occupation"
I want everybody naked wearing only fig leaves
I used the colors of the Palestinian and Israeli flags
Maybe we can do without those colors to draw a bigger crowd
We could always use the flags of Denmark and Sweden
They're pretty and they don't piss anybody off
Don't be so cynical
All I'm saying is the poster doesn't need the old politics
It can be more subtle we're young and against war
Where?
In New Zealand?
Maybe we should invite some Palestinians
We never have any
We haven't succeeded
Anyone know any young Palestinians who can come to our meetings?
Yeah, right.
This is bullshit!
How could they come?
They can't get permits!
You're all so disconnected!
You're living in denial
Go to the checkpoints!
Ever been to the West Bank?
And you?
I just spent a month on reserve duty at a checkpoint
You didn't refuse?
Hey, we're here for the poster
Talk politics later
Bye, Lulu
Want one?
There are lots left
The shirts are great
You're really talented
Thanks
So where are you going now?
For a drink with the boys
OK, so I'll see you
Cool place, right?
Golan's coming
Don't mention Shimi works at the cafe
He'll kill me
What's this?
It's a new production of "Bent." - "Bent?"
Yeah, it's a famous play
A love story about two men in a concentration camp
It's with Lior Ashkenazi
Yummy!
We've got to go!
Do you like theater?
I do.
But I've never seen a play in Hebrew
What's up, bro?
Meet my friends, Lulu, Noam
I told you about them
And this is Shimi, Noam's friend
Is your friend Palestinian?
Your shorts look a bit Palestinian
Sorry about Golan
He got out of the army two years ago but he still has the mentality of a Golani trooper
And proud of it!
Golan a Golani trooper forever!
Maybe his trooper friends should know what he does at night
Sister, my friends know exactly what I do
I came out like a man and they took it like men
These are my brothers, sweetheart
We busted our asses together fought terrorists in the Hebron Casbah
Believe me...
In the trenches, any minute some dog might shoot you from behind...
You learn it doesn't matter
As long as he's protecting you who cares if he's straight or gay?
I need a drink
Anyone coming along?
No, we'll stay
We hate Arabs too
Did I say something wrong?
Your friends don't like army talk?
What can I get you?
I'm leaving.
- What happened?
"14-Year-Old Boy Killed in Jenin by Occupation Forces"
What are you doing?
Just reading news from home
What's going on there?
- The usual stuff
Come on, pound me!
Pound me?
Pound me!
Problem?
I don't know...
- Consummate sound better?
Sexual intercourse?
Then just nail me from behind!
You're so drunk
It's not from the wine!
Not in the hallway, bro
Who's that woman?
My mother
Where does she live?
She doesn't.
She's dead
I'm sorry.
- It's OK
We used to live in Jerusalem
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
I want to be your whore
Yes!
Yes, Mama!
Yes!
Fuck me
Yes, Mama!
Yes!
Fuck me, Mama, fuck me!
Mama...
Fuck me.
- I want to be your whore
Perverts
Mama!
Mama!
I'll ask his army friends to pound you
Bring them on, I'm getting hot
Please
Good morning Sheinkin Street!
We would like to invite you to the best party in town
A rave against the occupation
A rave for peace
You are all welcome to come to the rave on October
We don't need the territories we need to dance!
Rave against the occupation!
A party for peace!
We all want peace, right?
We all want the same thing
Dance!
Dance!
Dance!
A rave for peace, let's all show up
Let's dance instead of shoot!
Let's all show up
Don't you ever learn?
Don't you ever change?
The new generation wants peace.
- What do you know?
Ever had an 8-year-old's leg fall on your face after a bombing?
Make them stop pushing me
They're hitting me
They're crazy
Animals!
I could punch them!
Morons
Are you OK?
- Better now
I'm on the verge of losing it
What are you talking about?
- I'm sick of everything
"Time Out Tel Aviv"
Come on
Lulu?
!
What's up with her?
Lulu
Where's Sharon?
- End of the hall, to the right
Is he expecting you?
- He should be
Hey, how are you?
Fuck you
That's how I am
What kind of talk is that?
Fuck you, loser
Who do you think you are?
Take it easy
Shut up.
You think you're " Cent" and I'm your bitch?
Why did you chase me for a month?
Just to get laid, run off and avoid my calls?
What kind of behavior is that?
I came here to tell you about a porn site
It's for the world's smallest dicks
They'll pay a fortune for yours
Let's go
They call it the "bubble" because nothing here is real
Look around.
These people have no connection to reality
Kibbutz life is a bubble, too
West Bank settlements are bubbles
Who can say anymore what's real and what's a bubble?
Maybe...
You're new here?
- Yes
So this is for you.
- Thank you
What's your name?
- Shimi
Shimi.
A pretty name for a pretty boy
Everything cool?
- Look at the tip I got
She pulls that trick on every new waiter
Once she finds out you're gay she'll go back to being cheap
Someone's here for you
Hello.
- Hey
You're new here?
That lady just pulled that on me
At least she left me a nice tip
Tips are nice
But I've got something better
Tonight, after the photo shoot for Lulu's poster
I'm taking you to the theater
Listen, do you...
What?
Miss it?
What?
You know
Yes.
- We don't have to
What?
Miss it.
We're here together
We don't have to miss it
We can't look at each other
We can't touch
We can feel...
- Feel what?
Each other.
Without looking
Without touching
I can feel you right now.
Next to me
Can you feel me?
Maybe
Don't worry
He won't hear us.
Feel me
No.
- I'm touching you
It's burning.
- I'm kissing you
Burning
- Kissing your lips
Hot.
- Kissing your eyes
Yes.
- Inside your mouth
Yes.
- Neck
Yes.
- Down
Yes.
- Down
Yes.
- Do you feel my mouth?
Do you feel my cock?
- Yes
Do you know what I am doing?
- Yes
Can you taste what I am doing?
- Yes
Together.
- Together
Do you feel me?
- I want you inside me
Feel.
- I have you inside me
Inside.
- Strong
I'm going to...
- Strong
Do you feel...
I'm going to...
- Strong
Strong.
- Yes
Strong.
- Yes
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Did you?
Yes
You?
- Yes
You're a good lay.
- So are you
Max?
- What?
We did it
How about that
Fucking guards, fucking camp, we did it
We were real
We made love
They're not going to kill us
I like that thing they did running a finger over their eyebrow instead of saying "I love you."
Luckily we don't need that
Maybe in Tel Aviv you don't
Where are you from in Jerusalem?
- French Hill
Really?
You know I used to live in Issawiya
Really?
How come you never told me?
I was very young when we left
I don't remember much
Maybe we were neighbors.
- Yeah, something like that
My father was born there all his family is from Jerusalem
So you have an Israeli ID?
- I used to
We used to live at my grandparents' house
When my younger sister was born it got crowded
So my father started building us a new house
He borrowed money opened his savings account
Built the house himself with family and friends
It was coming along great
My sister and I used to run around deciding who would get which room
And then we got a demolition warrant
And what happened?
- What happened?
...
One day a tractor came and tore it all down
My mom stood outside screaming but nothing helped
Within an hour, it was gone
What did you do?
- I was just a kid, what could I do?
I threw rocks at the tractor
But my father stopped me
That evening he told us we were moving to a place that was our own
We left.
Returned our IDs and moved to Nablus
My mother argued with him
She said Israeli IDs would be good to have
But my father refused
He couldn't take it
You scared me
Why are you sitting in the dark?
I didn't think there was anything to see
So, how was the play?
Interesting, lots of food for thought
You should go
Yeah, as I said pretty clearly at the Breakfast Club
I really want to see it
Oh...
- Never mind, it's no big deal
Yali, I'm so sorry
I totally forgot
Forget it.
Focus on yourself
You do that so well
What's that mean?
It means what it means.
- Do you want to talk about it?
I don't have anything to say.
- OK
I just think that something isn't right
It's not right that I'm happy?
- Of course you're happy...
If he's not straight or in a relationship, or a tourist at least let him be...
Never mind, let's change the subject
Come on, say it
How should I put it?
We've always tried to keep away from politics
We don't go to checkpoints with Lulu's mom
We try to just live and...
Don't you get it?
Sorry to rain on your parade, but...
He's really sweet and I watch over him at the caf but...
Somehow it doesn't feel real
So what do you suggest?
I don't know, Noam
Just more food for thought
I'll talk to him about the nudity it'll be fine
Don't you trust me?
Leave it to me
OK, he's here.
Bye
What's up?
- How are you?
There you go.
- For me, a double espresso, thanks
I'll have a Corona
No problem
So, what is this about?
Alright.
As I told you it's our Spring Special
Every celebrity we choose gets a two-page spread and recommends the hottest things of the hour
And you get the cover.
- Who's in it?
Artists.
Celebs
People of the hour
You, with your new play, "Bent."
Camilla, the winner from "Big Brother"
Mali Levi, with her new jeans campaign, you know
What concept did you have in mind?
- It'll be a huge production
You, in the center, naked
Around you, fifteen naked girls...
Did you even see the play?
- Of course I did.
Quality stuff
But hey.
The play is one thing and the Spring Special is another
Face it.
The Holocaust is not sexy
And my cover has to be sexy
Yeah, I guess the Holocaust isn't that sexy
There you go.
- Thanks
How are you?
- Excuse me?
Don't you remember me?
- Remind me
You remember we met at Lulu's apartment
And then at Time Out
You must remember that
Maybe you're confusing me with someone else
Don't be scared
I wanted to talk to you about doing a story
"Tel Aviv through the eyes of a Palestinian."
Excuse me a moment
Yali, I'm sorry, I have to...
Where did he go?
I hope I didn't scare him
What did you say to him?
Just that I want to do a story about him
A story about him?
You got any more Palestinians working here?
We could do a group piece.
- What?
They're all legal, right?
- What do you mean?
He's gone
OK...
Maybe we'll talk about it some other time
Why didn't you tell us, silly?
Open the window,
Mix the outside with the inside...
My God, it stinks in here
You need air
Your crotch smell is all over town
The neighbors are asking if there's a corpse in here
Look, sweetie, hop into the shower
Take a walk, then go back to bed
Diet-wise, it's great.
Like a double Yom Kippur
Cleans the blood wonderfully
I'll give you some onion pills to totally clean your system
It's your mom
Yes, mom
I turned mine off for a sec
No, Ashraf isn't here
He went back to Nablus, why?
driven by Riyad Bek, leader of the mil itary arm of Hamas.
to launch local cells of Al-Qaeda.
Hamas vowed to avenge...
No answer
I keep sending him messages
I don't know what to do
What do we do about him?
Tell me...
Do you think I can pass for a TV reporter going to the territories?
Someone like Christiane Amanpour?
Have you gone crazy too?
I have an idea
I have a great idea
"Rave against the occupation"
Shaul
Shaul
I wanted to bring you one but I thought it would be cooler if you saw them already up
They look good.
- Good?
They looks great
Thanks to you
You're the best
Thanks
Listen, I would love to stay and help, but I have to run
Anything happen?
Actually, a lot's happened
I'll tell you some other time
Promise?
- Promise
Sharon?
The trouble girl is on her way to your office
It's OK, she's here
I'll take care of it
What do you want?
Don't make me call the pol ice
Chill, you have a chance to help me and get a cease-fire
Help you with what?
- I need press cards
Press cards?
- Yes, temporary cards
Like the ones you got us for the rock gig
You can cut out these pictures
We need to get through checkpoints
We're going to Nablus.
- Nablus?
Yes.
To do a story
About what?
About how Palestinian men act the morning after
Don't start that again
Yali did a great job with the car
I'm tell ing you, he could be an art director in movies
He said to put this up in front.
- He put a lot of work into this
But he balled out on the trip
It's impossible to get him out of Tel-Aviv
We should switch to English
We can't use Hebrew there
Sounds bad
They'll know immediately you're Israeli
Do a French accent
No one will know
You're crazy, I can't talk like that
There's the checkpoint
I hope no one recognizes me
Next in line.
Move on
Put down the suitcase
Open the suitcase
Take it out
Give it to me
Sorry
What's that?
It's Henna, for the wedding
Give it to me.
Let me see
You sure it's Henna?
Henna
Check if it's Henna
It is.
- You can pack
Close the door
What are you doing here?
You want them to kill me?
I was worried about you
I'm sorry, I wanted to call back
You don't know what it's like here
I'm sorry
You're really crazy
Jihad!
Wait.
You can't tell anyone
I never thought you were one of those
Promise me you won't tell!
I won't ruin the most beautiful week of your sister's life
Did you invite them?
No.
They'll leave.
- Now!
Make them leave!
- Promise me
Till the wedding
After that, only Allah knows
My cousin Samira will be at the wedding
You must marry her
If you do maybe I won't say anything
Why do this?
- It's that way
I missed you
Welcome
Are you OK?
Are you sure?
I was so scared
Let me speak to him
Don't you see he's a wreck?
You must come to the rave
Know where it is?
He misses you terribly
She's right.
I really do
Why didn't you invite Golan?
He doesn't fit in.
- Why not?
But I'll find someone
Plenty to choose from
What a relief
And you, Mr. Depression?
- What about me?
Have some MDMA
What for?
For fun, dummy
You did it!
- What do you mean?
Fashionably late Comrade Ashraf
What an entrance
You're getting bitchy!
I'm only kidding
Aren't jokes allowed anymore?
I'm so happy you came.
- I didn't think I would make it
The checkpoints took hours then getting into Israel hitchhiking through the mountains And then... you don't need the details
I'm really happy you're here
Hey, what are you doing here?
Is this a private party?
Got a strict door policy?
No, I'm glad you came but...
Because it's a rave?
I'm into causes, too
I'm totally left-wing, bro
See you
I saved us some
I thought you might come
I'm so happy you came
Open wide
Say ah!
You're such a sucker
That's the first trick in Golan's book
I dance with someone else...
You get jealous and come crawling
What do you want?
Stop being so heavy
Dance with me, man!
Did it kick in?
What?
Yeah, I guess it did
Go get her...
She's not waiting for me
You know, I love you.
- Really?
Really
And I want us to make love
And then get married and have lots of children
Are you rolling on X?
No, it's real
It's not because I'm high
I really feel it
OK
I'll decide later if I join you or let you do it alone
Remember the playground between French Hill and Issawiya?
Yeah, the Jews' playground
We never went there
At first, all the kids played there until we were about 6 years old
Maybe we even played there together
I don't think so I would have spotted you
I'm joking
My father was our neighborhood committee president
There were complaints about Arab kids scaring the other kids
So he got an order preventing the Issawiya kids from playing there
My mother had a terrible fight with him
She invited all the mothers and kids from Issawiya to come to a reconciliation party at the playground
My father laughed at her "attempt at World Peace."
He said no one would come
And on the day of the party no one did
Not even the Israeli mothers
Later we found out they were scared off
We sat there drinking juice and eating cake
She pushed me high on the swings
Back home, my father and brother were watching soccer on TV
Later, in the bath, I noticed my Mom had tears in her eyes
She was trying to wipe them away so I pretended I didn't see them
I know it sounds crazy but I think that was the day the illness began in her body
Somehow, I'm sure of that
I just love the city on Saturday mornings
Tel Aviv has such beautiful moments
Yeah, like now when everything is quiet and calm
I really love Tel Aviv
It's a shame it's surrounded by such crap
If we could only make all the politics disappear
Why didn't you invite Shaul?
- What For?
We saw you two
It seemed so nice and romantic
And what about Golan?
Don't change the subject we're talking about Shaul
He was high on X.
- High on you!
What's the matter?
He's sexy.
- He was wasted
"I swear it's not because I'm roll ing
"I'm in love with you, you're beautiful and I really wanna fuck you
"Is anal an option?"
Can you really play?
- Sure
I wanted to be a rock star
Really?
In high school we even had a band, "The Sirens."
We used to cover classics
Do you know Tim Buckley?
No
During the army I quit music and never really came back to it
And now it's too late
It's not too late.
We're still young
You can do anything you want
At my age?
- "At my age?"
Very funny
Come on, sing something
I want to hear you sing
Come on.
- Really?
Yeah?
This is a song my mother loved she always wanted me to play it for her
You don't have to
I want to
Wait a second
What was her name?
- Whose name?
Your mother's
Sarah
Her name was Sarah
"my love" in Arabic, but you never taught me how.
Anyway, I'm off to work.
Have a nice trip back.
Have fun at the wedding.
And say "Mazal Tov" to your sister.
Maybe you shouldn't say it's from me.
But come back to me soon.
Very soon.
How did you sleep?
- Like a rock.
You?
Me too
Excuse me, is this lemon or lemongrass?
I can't really tell from here but it says on the label
What's up?
Remember what I told you last night?
I was totally wasted
I don't remember much
I said I wanted us to get married, have kids
You said I was just high
Don't you remember?
Sort of
Well, it's true
I want us to be together
What?
Right now?
From this very second?
Yes
OK.
But do we really have to get married?
I'm not up for the whole religious thing.
No way
You're the boss
It's OK.
Your not bothering me I'm just smell ing soap
Stop, not here
I'm going to "Erez" for bread
I'll come back later
Go on, it's very sweet
Alright
Come on
Put down the bags
Come on.
Come on
Open the bags so the soldier can see what's in there
Come on, let's see
Have your IDs ready
Excuse me, soldier these people are guests coming to my sister's wedding
Maybe you could please...
- What are they to you?
They're guests for my sister's wedding
Where are you from?
Nablus
Hello, Ashraf
Welcome
Sorry for the delay
Don't worry, they'll let you through in a minute
You'll be on time
God willing
What does he want?
I don't know
Ashraf Sirtawi from Nablus
Stay out of this
Get in line with the others.
- Hey, I was just explaining...
You understand Hebrew, right?
Get in line before I have you detained
They're my sister's guests...
Stand aside!
Am I clear?
How are you, gorgeous?
Thank God you're here!
What's up?
Jihad hasn't arrived yet
Stop worrying
He'll be here soon
Jihad's mother was here and she started talking about naming our baby after Jihad's father
What baby?
I have so much to do before that
I need to find work finish my studies make sure we have everything...
Then we'll see
Forget it, it's just talk
You just think about the wedding
You think so?
- Yes
What's happening with you?
You've become fashionable.
- Don't like it?
- It's very nice
Where are the clothes from?
From her?
Who is she?
I don't care if she's divorced, tell me!
Remember the news team that was here when you arrived?
That beautiful French girl?
You're my sister eventually you'll have to know
Don't make it sound like a Jordanian soap opera!
Is that French girl Jewish?
Not an Israeli!
- No, it's not her...
The guy that was with her
Noam, from Tel Aviv
What about him?
He's very nice, really
I don't understand.
What about him?
No, you do understand
I love him and...
I don't understand and neither do you!
You're just confused
Where did you get these ideas?
First she's French then a Christian divorcee and now it's a guy?
Where does this nonsense come from?
It's those American movies you watch
Why are you like this?
- Me?
Why are you like this?
Have you gone mad?
This conversation is over
I have to do my makeup
We'll talk later
Please, if you love me you must understand me
No, you understand me!
That's enough.
We'll talk after the wedding
Surprising choice... think it will work?
I get goose bumps when I sing it...
Who was that?
- Golan.
I'm not in the mood
Why are you so mean to him?
He was so sweet at the rave I saw everything
I'm not into him.
- Does he know?
No.
- So tell him
He'll figure it out.
- Why be an asshole?
Can't you tell him?
He won't cut his wrists
Men are such stupid animals
Please, no Judith Butler now
It's the semi-finals!
No lectures.
- I can't understand why men after all the revolutions are still so emotionally crippled
And you gays are the worst
Call him now
Meet him, and tell him
Now!
OK
Hey, sweetie
Just getting ready for the oMop Idol emi-finals
Never mind
You feel like having coffee?
No, not at "Orna and Ella"
let's go to Caf Bialik
Eight o'clock?
OK.
Bye
Congratulations
What's happening?
- Everything's according to plan
Go up to Samira.
She's waiting
Go to her
Hello.
- Hi
How are you?
- Good.
And you?
The truth?
So so
Uptight about your sister's wedding?
- Yes, a little
What are you doing these days?
I'm studying here, in college
You know how it is here the level isn't too high
I want to study architecture abroad.
- Really?
I want to go to London I've got relatives there
London.
Not bad
They've got great music
They have it all
Maybe you should come too
You'll be better off there
Things will never get better here
And you'll escape Jihad and his stupid friends
I want to go dance a little
I'll be back later.
- OK
Dropped him off in Tel Aviv?
I can't hear
You're breaking up
Dropped him off in Tel Aviv?
Great
Great.
May Allah bless you
I'll wait to hear it on the radio
Goodbye
A bomb!
- Are you sure?
And not far away
I'll see what happened
Lulu, did you hear?
-Good, it's you.
It was really big
The whole house shook
I thought something would break
Something broke?
No, nothing, I think.
Where's Yali?
He went out for coffee a date with Golan
Hold on, I have a call
Noam, that was Golan
He was late
The bomb was at Caf Bialik./What?
You're here!
I mean alive.
You're alive
We were worried sick
We thought the worst
You are OK, right?
- Yes, our sweet Yali is fine
Don't get emotional on me
I don't need drama queens
I've been declared
"moderately wounded"
It doesn't even hurt
I just can't feel my legs
They say it's the injections
You'll be fine, I'm sure
We're Yali's roommates
I'm Lulu, this is Noam
Good thing you got here fast
We were waiting
We panicked
When we called the hospital the line was busy
I was scared to come directly here
My mother called a doctor friend
That's how we knew
Hey
I'm so sorry
I realized I forgot my wallet
I had to go back.
That's why I was late
Just a little late
I got there a few seconds after the explosion
I brought you purple flowers your favorite color
Is that him?
Answer him
He must be worried
It's alright.
I'll talk to him later
Answer already
Noam, where are you?
Answer me
That bomb was near your house
Is everybody OK?
You, not answering worries me
I have to talk to you
I told my sister
I "came out", as you guys say
Call me as soon as you hear this
No matter what time
My phone is on
Bye, "Hubi"
That's "My Love" in Arabic
Nice of you to fix it like the cafe
Don't talk, eat
Tell me...
- Not with your mouth full
Seriously.
How come you and I never got together?
What?
You heard me
What didn't you understand?
Isn't it obvious?
- No
The moment I met you I knew you'd be the best guy I'd ever know
I decided not to ruin it with a one night stand or a short affair
You and me, it's forever
Soul mates till we die
Well, I guess
I won't be dying this time
But good answer very good answer
You always knew how to say the right thing at the right time
Good morning.
- Good morning
A wonderful morning.
- A wonderful morning to the newlyweds
Thank you.
- I hope you are happy
I am
You looked gorgeous last night like a bride on TV
Thanks
I was so nervous yesterday I didn't pay attention to anyone
I couldn't even sleep
A bride doesn't sleep on her wedding night!
You'll have time for sleep later...
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Hold your fire!
Come on, let's get 'em!
Rana
Rana
Rana
Don't be scared, my love
Don't be scared
Rana, talk to me!
I was going to bring it to you in bed
You make coffee as well?
Nice
Don't you want coffee?
Never mind, I'm a bit screwed up
When someone's nice to me I think something must be wrong
Hi, Mom, what's up?
What happened?
There'll be orphans in every house!
In every street!
Are you sure?
OK Mom, I'll call you later

That's his favorite
Some coffee while you wait?
A double, thanks
How is he?
- Alright
But he doesn't know he won't walk again
We're afraid.
The doctors say we can wait to tell him
That's tough
Ashraf?
What happened?
I had this weird sensation
Like an electric shock
Something's wrong
Everything's fine, silly
Panacotta is on the way
You'll eat to your heart's content
in the middle of the empty street.
Hubi, my love...
Let's fly away
Maybe beyond the smoke and the fighting
there's a better place
Maybe there really is a paradise where we can just love each other
I don't know...
I wonder if we ever really had a chance?
If, even for a moment, we had a chance....
Maybe if we had, then...
Lulu and Yali will probably give the papers a photo of the two of us
Maybe the one from the rave where we look all high and happy
Maybe people will see how beautiful we look and understand how stupid these wars are
No, they probably never will
- Dad, are you awake?
- Yes.
It's time to get up.
What do you think?
- Is it breakfast time?
- Yes, it sure is.
- Well...
- Better get up.
I need a bite.
Need your glasses?
Yeah, on the pillow there.
Dad, I got your breakfast.
Good for you.
It looks delicious.
Do you need anything else?
Piece of toast, cup of coffee?
No, I don't need no coffee this morning.
I think I'll do with the orange juice.
- If you need anything, yell.
- Thank you.
[Honks]
- Good morning.
- Morning.
So how's your mom doing today?
She's doing good.
She working yet?
No, she hasn't found anything.
- Good morning.
- Hey, how are you doing today?
- Good.
How are you?
- Terrific.
What can I help you with this morning?
I think I'll have...
a twister.
- Okay.
Is this for here or to go?
- It'll be for here.
I want to get a picture.
Okay.
- 'Cause you're my bestest friend.
- Huh?
You're my best friend, and I just need to get a picture of you.
Where do you want me to stand?
Here's really good.
It's almost too nice to go in there, you think?
Yeah, let's go back.
- I was talking to Judy yesterday.
- Yeah?
She was telling me about the huge order they have coming in, which means we're really gonna have to pump up production.
- That's great.
- That's what I thought.
We're already doing too much as it is.
I think so too.
They need to get some more help.
- What do you think?
- Yeah.
[Machinery whirring]
So you think tonight maybe you can give me a ride to my other job at the shovel factory?
- You know I will.
- Yeah.
I always told you if you ever needed a ride or anything, all you had to do was ask.
I appreciate it.
No problem.
You been out on a date lately?
No, not for a while.
No prospects, huh?
No.
I've been busy working pretty much.
I leave here and I only got so much time before I have to go to the other job, so...
It's about like the rest of us, I'm telling you.
Plus I gotta work nights, so if I want to go out at night,
I can't do that, unless I have a day off, so...
- I'm ready for the beaches.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I want to go to Aruba.
- Oh, yeah?
I saw that on TV the other day.
The beaches are great.
I think I'm about done.
How about you?
Yeah.
I'm gonna go and smoke.
You talk to your dad lately?
Um, no, not since the last time.
It's probably...
six months ago.
Where's he at now?
Last I heard he was living in Arizona, I think, and, uh, I guess he got remarried to someone.
I haven't heard from him since.

Also approved was $29,000 to retain Roseanne Buell as the county's Juvenile Justice liaison.
Nearly 22,000 baby boomers in West Virginia have no health insurance as they near retirement.
A Marshall University study says of those who participated in the study, 75% say their health is in excellent or even...
- Hi.
- Hey.
How's work?
It was all right.
How are you?
I'm all right.
You hungry?
Uh, no, I don't think so.
- I'm just gonna go to bed.
- All right.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- You ready for your first day?
- Oh, yeah.
- Not nervous or anything?
- No.
I'm fine.
Okay, that's great.
So tell me again, do you have airbrush experience?
Yeah.
I used to airbrush T-shirts at the mall.
Great.
When you were doing that, were you working with other airbrushers, or were you just waiting on the customers?
No.
I just worked by myself.
They would bring me what I needed, bring me the orders, and I would take care of it.
Okay, well, that's really good.
We'll see what happens.
Good morning, everybody.
I know you guys are all aware of the big order that we've got in, and we've been working hard to get it done, but we feel like you guys need some help.
And so here she is.
Her name is Rose.
We were very fortunate to find Rose in the fact that she has airbrush experience.
She's worked with stencils before, so she'll be working in the head-painting area.
I'm sure she'll have questions throughout the day, so please help her.
I found Rose, when we were interviewing her, to be very sweet and the consummate team player, so I think she'll fit in really well with our workforce here.
So I'll let you guys introduce her through the course of the day, and, um, please help her out with anything that she needs.
Get to work.
[Airbrush hissing]
You know you got to double-glue those before you put 'em in the box, right?
Yes, I'm aware of that.
So do either of you smoke?
- I don't.
- Yeah, I smoke.
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, when you're done, if you want to, we can go grab a cigarette.
- Sure.
- Okay.
Where did you used to work?
I used to work at a nursing home.
And what'd you do there?
I was a professional ass-wiper.
You know, the bottom, the CNA.
The one that everybody comes to when something dirty needs done is basically what I did.
I took care of people, the people who can't do for themselves anymore, you have to do everything that they can't do:
Shower them, dress them, feed them.
Just depends on who you have, what you have to do.
It's a hard job that you really, really have to be dedicated to.
You really have to like what you're doing or you just can't.
'Cause there's, like, days you go in there and it's just...
You just want to turn around and walk out, it's that bad.
This isn't as hard of work, but...
I don't think I'm gonna like this much better.
And what about you?
What was the question?
Where did you work before you came here?
I used to work maintenance in an old factory.
- That's cool.
- Mmm.
I'm very ready to get out of this area.
Why is that?
'Cause there's nothing here.
Mm-hmm.
I'm living in this little apartment with my daughter.
She's two.
You can't make money in this area.
It's just poor.
Everything's poor.
Are you married?
No, I'm not married.
I thought I would be, but things don't always work out like you think they're going to.
You know.
Just another bad decision.
Yeah.
What are you doing right after work today?
Well, I probably have to... get home and see my dad.
- Do you think you might be able to give me a ride?
- I don't see why not.
I have another job that I have to be at like right after, but it's not that far from here.
Okay.
I'd really appreciate it.
No problem.
Are you about done?
Yeah, think so.
[Rose] I guess we're gonna go have a cigarette, and we'll see you back up there in a little bit.
Okay.
Ready?
Rose?
Where are you?
I'm in the bathroom.
Oh, my God, Rose!
What are you doing?
I'm taking a bath.
Do you do this all the time?
No, not all the time.
Remember when I told you I worked in a nursing home?
I sure did.
I got hit in the back with a tray table by this little old man.
And it messed up my back.
I couldn't pick Jesse up for like a month.
But every once in a while my muscles will contract, and I get really sore.
And this feels really good.
And my apartment has no bathtub.
It just has a shower, so I take advantage.
But I clean it when I'm done.
I clean after I bathe.
- Okay.
- [Giggles]
I was kind of wondering.
I didn't know what would happen if we'd get caught.
No.
She won't be here for a long time.
Oh, my gosh!
I mean, every room was the size of my whole living room.
The bedrooms...
You could fit my whole house in two rooms in that house.
I could not believe it.
Gorgeous!
Chandeliers coming down out of the ceiling.
- It was unreal.
- Hmm.
I mean, just fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.
And then... you are not gonna believe this.
She tells me how particular this lady is.
And then she invites me inside of this house that she's cleaning.
Guess what.
She was in the Jacuzzi bathtub...
I am not kidding...
taking a bath.
- She was supposed to be cleaning it?
- Yes!
- Got sidetracked.
- I'm not kidding.
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was gonna die.
All I could think about was that lady coming home and catching...
You know, here I am, not supposed to be there, in there checking her house out, and there's Rose in the tub.
And you know, I thought, "Wow."
Yeah, I'd be afraid of 'em just coming home too early.
I'm not too sure about her.
- Yeah?
- What do you think?
I don't know.
She seems fine to me.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
She scares me a little.
Hmm.
[Air hissing]
I was working at a restaurant, and they work day and night.
Turn two different shifts.
I just didn't have anybody to care for him.
It was really rough, and I didn't want to have to put him in a nursing home.
- The expense for that is huge.
- Yeah, those places...
And you don't want to do that unless you absolutely have to.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Because a lot of times they're understaffed or they don't have all the equipment that they need.
You know, you get people in there that shouldn't be there, that should be in other facilities, that are violent.
You know, you just, you never know what you're gonna get.
You don't know who they're gonna put in the room with 'em.
You know, because it's not...
The way that they put people together is not necessarily by what their sickness may be, like, you know, put two stroke patients in the same room.
Some people might be bedridden, and some people might be up walking around.
And they get into each other's things and tear stuff up.
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.
- Glad I didn't do that.
- No.
And as far as, like, management, they're so tight that what they'll do is take...
You know, you might clock out, but if they see you walking across the parking lot, they'll be like, "Can you come just for a minute and come help with this or that?"
And you end up staying over an hour or better.
And that happens three or four days a week.
So you don't even get paid.
But you need your job, so what do you say?
- Yeah.
- You're kind of st...
You don't want to make anybody mad, you know.
- And they do it to everybody.
- Oh, really?
So everybody kind of just did it, you know?
[Woman] Wow.
I can't imagine them doing that here.
We're gonna make quota and get some of that bonus.
- Did you guys hear about that?
- No, I haven't heard anything.
Yeah, we're gonna get probably about $50 if we meet quota at the end of the week.
I thought that was great.
That's awfully nice of 'em.
Yeah, that'll help me out a lot with bills and things.
That's what you'd spend it on if you got it?
I probably will just...
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.
What do you think you'll spend yours on?
I don't know.
If the weather keeps getting nice,
I'll get camping equipment or something like that.
- Oh, that sounds like fun.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, if you're looking to make a little bit of extra money,
I was wanting to go out this weekend.
If you want to baby-sit Jesse for a few hours,
I couldn't pay a whole lot, but I could give you a little bit.
- What night?
- Friday night.
If that would work out for you.
Sure.
I think I could do that for you.
- Could you?
- Yeah.
- She's really good.
- How old is she?
- She's two.
- Okay.
It'll be nice for her too, 'cause it'll give her somebody else to be around.
She doesn't...
She's not around too many other people.
[Woman] What's she like to do?
[Rose] She likes to color and she likes to read books.
[Woman] Okay.
Yeah, and she goes to bed at 8:00, so more than likely...
That's great, 'cause that way I can sew after...
- Oh, yeah.
- That's good, that's good.
- Okay, no problem.
- Great.
I'm excited now.
Are you about done?
Yeah, pretty much.
- Wanna have a smoke?
- Sure.
Now, you know I probably won't be home till about 11:00, and I left a number hanging on the refrigerator if you need me.
- I was wondering if you left me a number.
- Yeah, I sure did.
- If I need to get ahold of you.
- Yes, I did.
[Rose] So she should be going to bed in about a half an hour, usually about 8:00.
About 15 minutes before you put her to bed, just give her a few goldfish crackers and some juice, just enough to put something in her stomach.
But she should be all right.
She may cry whenever I leave.
- Just kind of expect it.
- Okay.
All you have to do is lay her down and just read her a book, and she'll get her blanket, suck her thumb and she'll be done.
All right.
That sounds great.
She's pretty easy.
[Gurgling]
Hey, sweetie, what do you have there?
[Knocking]
[Gasps] Who's here?
Who's here?
Watch out.
- Hey, come in.
- Hey, come in.
Hello.
Come here, sweetie.
Who's the man?
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.
[Jesse jabbering]
- So, this is your date?
- Yeah.
Oh.
We're going out tonight for a little bit.
And, uh, who's driving?
I am.
I borrowed a...
I borrowed a car off my friend.
Oh.
He let me take it out tonight.
I see.
Can I have a kiss?
Mommy's gonna go for a little bit.
Are you gonna be okay?
- No!
- Yes, you will.
- I want my baby!
- Okay, you get your baby.
- I guess we're gonna go and...
- Okay.
- What's that?
- It's another baby.
You can take that baby and go night-night with it.
- Love you.
- Mama, I wanna go with you.
No.
You're gonna stay here with Martha.
Yeah.
You're gonna have fun.
- Come here, sweetie.
- No!
We'll read a story.
Would you like to read a story?
- No!
- I see a really nice book.
Look!
She's got a book.
And she's gonna read to you.
- No!
- I'll be back in a little bit.
- Here, give me a kiss.
- No!
I want to go that way!
You might want to get her now.
I go that way!
[Crying]
- Come here, sweetie.
- No!
- Do you want to play with some toys?
- No!
- Well, come on.
- No!
Oh, sweetie.
Yeah, but seriously, it seems like every time I think I'm saving a little bit, getting a little bit ahead, something comes up.
- Jesse gets sick.
- Yeah.
Have you been able to save much?
A little bit.
I don't have a checking account or anything, but...
I got drawer change I've been saving.
- Drawer change, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah, he's got his own place, and then Jesse and I live together.
Yeah, he wasn't ready for our baby.
He's an artist, and he's very into his work and what's going on with him.
He doesn't have time, you know, for anybody else.
But he helps out with her.
He baby-sits while I work sometimes, if he has time, or whatever.
That's good.
At least he sticks around a little bit and sees her.
Yeah.
He makes an effort.
So did you finish high school?
No.
Actually, I had anxiety, and I ended up quitting.
What is that?
Oh, just when I got around a lot of people, you know,
I'd get a little bit nervous and sometimes I'd have a panic attack.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It was pretty bad, enough to quit.
Did you go to a doctor or anything for that?
Um...
Yeah, I did at one point, but they just kept prescribing me pills that didn't work, so I eventually just quit going and dealt with it myself, you know?
There's not much you can do about it, so...
Are you taking anything right now?
- No.
- No?
And how do you do?
Does that bother you anymore?
It's not as bad now, you know.
Usually, the places I go, there's not 400 people like school.
Yeah.
It's usually when there's a lot of people.
Lately, it's only temporary when it's bad.
Mm-hmm.
Did you finish high school?
No, I didn't finish.
What happened there?
I got rebellious in high school.
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I ran away, hitchhiked to Charleston.
- Yeah.
- How old were you then?
- Fifteen.
- Kind of dangerous, isn't it?
Yeah, a little bit.
It was fun at the time.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And look now.
- I'd like to save up and get a car.
- Oh, yeah.
- That's nice to have.
- Yeah.
So where do you live?
- I live with my mom right now.
- Oh, really?
Yeah.
It's just a matter of money, really.
Trying to save up.
It's the easiest way to do it.
Yeah, I hear you.
Is your mom home right now?
Well, actually, I don't know.
Well, would you rather just like maybe go back there where there's not so many people?
Well, I guess we could, yeah.
Okay.
Those are very pretty.
Your mom must like jewelry.
Yeah.
Look at that.
- It's pretty.
- Yeah.
Oh, we lost it.
- It's a giraffe.
- A giraffe.
Oh, okay.
It looks like a dinosaur a little bit.
- It's a giraffe-dinosaur.
- Yeah.
What's this?
A purple necklace.
- Is that a purple necklace?
- Yeah.
[Baby talk]
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mom, this is Rose.
- Hi, Rose.
What's up?
- It's nice to meet you.
Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.
What are you guys doing?
Nothing.
This is the girl that they hired at the factory the other day.
- Hi.
Kyle told me about you.
- Oh, really?
Yeah, he did.
So how do you like it there?
It's pretty good.
It's not too bad.
It's busy but, you know, it's a job.
Yeah, jobs really get that way.
You guys wanna watch this?
It's pretty good.
No.
I think we're just gonna go hang out in the bedroom for a little bit.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Okay.
- [Laughs]
- See you later.
- Bye.
This is a pretty interesting room you have.
What's that picture of?
That's a tattoo.
My friend drew it for me there.
He does tattoos and stuff.
That is crazy-looking.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I like it.
Do you have any tattoos?
Yeah, I got two tattoos on my arm here.
No kidding.
Are they exactly the same?
Yeah.
They're symmetrical.
That's cool.
Are you gonna get any more?
Yeah, I'll probably end up getting up to about here or so.
He'll probably come up with something good I can put on.
A friend of mine in Marietta did one on my back.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm not ready for another one though.
Did it hurt or anything?
No, it didn't hurt.
I'm just, I don't know what else I want that's like forever.
- Yeah.
- You know.
Oh, yeah.
It's definitely permanent.
Oh, yeah.
Do you like hanging out in tattoo shops?
Yeah.
I got a couple friends that are tattoo artists.
Yeah, it is fun.
You meet a lot of people.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's a nice watch.
Where'd you get that?
Thank you.
It was a gift from someone.
I used to clean their house.
Oh, yeah?
Kind of like a tip?
- Yeah, like a big thank-you.
- That's nice of them.
Yeah, it was very nice of them.
I see you've got a lot of High Times stuff.
Do you smoke?
Yeah, I'm a smoker.
Oh, yeah?
I figured.
Yeah, I'm a smoker.
[Laughs]
Would your mom get mad if we smoked in here?
Um, I think I can make it so she won't know.
Yeah.
I just don't want her prying in.
Right, yeah.
Yeah, I think we can get away with it.
That's cool.
Do you, uh, want a drink or anything?
You know, that would be good.
Do you have any beer?
Yeah, I got a beer.
I'll be right back.
[TV playing]
- Thank you very much.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, man.
- What?
It's starting to get kind of late.
I'm gonna have to get back to Jesse.
I told Martha we'd only be a few hours, but...
I'll just let you have this, and you can save it for another time or later, whatever.
Okay.
I'm sure I'll save it for another time.
We can hang out and drink a beer, and then we're gonna have to take off.
All right, that's cool.
So I don't think I wanna go back in there because of Martha and all.
What about Martha?
I don't know.
She gave me a weird vibe when I was in there earlier like she was mad at me or something.
For going out with me?
I don't know.
It could be anything.
She just gave me a weird vibe when I was in there earlier.
Okay, that's fine.
I did have fun with you though.
Yeah, I did too.
Definitely have to do it again.
Well, just, you know, get ahold of me.
- Yeah, all right.
- I'll see you at work Monday.
- Okay.
Talk to you later.
- Bye.
So how was your date?
Oh, it was all right.
I really wish you guys would've told me.
Told you what?
That you guys were going out together.
- Why?
- Well, you could've told...
- I felt like an idiot.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- How was Jesse?
- Jesse was great.
Was she?
Did you have a good time with her?
Yeah.
She really likes those necklaces.
Yeah, she does.
She's something.
Sure is.
She went to bed about like what you said.
Had her juice and her crackers and went up to bed.
[Knocking]
- Hey, guess what.
- Hey.
Guess what happened at my house.
- [Door closes]
- What do you want?
Uh, a little bit of money, a bag of herb... and the truth.
That's about it.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Okay, cool.
Exactly.
- What?
- All the shit that's missing from my house.
- Where the fuck is it?
- I was out.
- I wasn't at your house.
- Yeah, I noticed.
He's cute.
- He is none of your business.
- Okay, then take his money.
- Don't come in my house, in my face...
- Then don't come in my house!
I didn't go in your house and take your shit, okay?
I don't have anything of yours.
You have my car, that you like to drive around town, that you're so happy with.
- I need the damn car, okay?
- You don't think I need it?
I take Jesse around, I take her out shopping, buying her fucking Happy Meals, all that good shit.
But I can't do it without my damn money.
- I don't have your money.
- Okay...
I don't have your fucking money, Jake!
It's not here.
You can look around.
There's no money.
I have no money, and I have no weed.
- You're childish.
- You are such a fucking baby.
It's all about Jake.
What Jake wants, what Jake needs.
- I don't have your shit!
- I need my money.
- Go sell some of your shit and make some money.
- It's the stupid principle!
Principle of what?
You coming into my house, banging on my door late at night, accusing me of shit?
You need to pick my shit off the floor.
Pick it up and give me my money.
Unless you spent it all.
At least did you spend it on Jesse?
- Huh?
Did did you buy her some clothes?
- Get out of my house.
Oh, excuse me.
- Was that Jesse's daddy?
- You know what?
Martha, please, just mind your own business, okay?
Read your book.
[TV playing]
Hello, Sergeant.
Detective Taylor.
- Sgt. Davis.
- What do we got?
We got a phone call at 6:45 from a neighbor stating that a child had been crying all night long.
She couldn't get anybody to answer the door, so she called 911.
We responded, made entry.
Once inside, we found a 23-year-old female on the living room floor by the name of Rose Hilliard.
Okay.
Any sign of forced entry?
- No sign.
- Any sign of robbery?
Doesn't appear to be.
- What about a struggle?
- Appears to be a struggle, yes.
- Let's go and take a look.
- Okay.
Dad, I've got your breakfast.
Well, how nice of you.
What are we having, cereal this morning?
Yeah.
Cereal and some juice.
Well, you're right, Sarge.
There's no sign of forced entry into the apartment.
Doesn't look like a robbery.
Her valuables and her purse are still here.
She's got bruising to the neck, which is consistent with manual strangulation.
She's got petechiae hemorrhage of the eyes.
- Where's the baby?
- Baby's with the grandmother.
- So the baby's safe?
- Yes.
Ross, when you're doing the fingerprints,
I want you to process the bruising on her neck for prints.
Okay, sir.
What did we find out from the neighborhood canvass?
Officer Smeeks?
You wanna fill the detective in on what you know?
Okay.
Now, I spoke to three of the neighbors.
Hey, Mom, you didn't happen to pick up any money in my room, did you?
No, I didn't.
I haven't been in your room.
- Didn't see in your room.
- All right.
Maybe you spent more than you thought you did.
I had a little bit saved up, so I might have misplaced it or something.
I was checking if you were in there and picked it up.
No, haven't been in there.
Haven't seen it.
Was it a lot of money?
No, just a little I had saved up for an emergency.
This is a ring that my mother had given me.
When I turned 30, she said I'd be responsible enough to take care of it.
Okay, so it's pretty sentimental, huh?
Yeah, it is, and this is my grandmother's broach, and that was handed down through the family, and my mother thought she had gotten that, but I got it.
You'll never guess where this came from.
Where's that?
I found this in the park with a metal detector.
- Oh, wow.
Nice find.
- I thought that was pretty good.
Jake?
I'm Det.
Taylor from the police department.
I need to talk to you for a minute.
Can I come in?
Uh, is it necessary?
It's kind of important.
It's about Rose Hilliard.
I need to talk to you about her.
All right, man.
Come on in.
Right through this door.
- Did you do this on the walls?
- Yeah, yeah, most of it.
Very interesting.
Some would say.
How long have you known Rose?
Oh, man, I've known her for a while, like...
We were together for at least a year and a half.
Probably altogether, I guess five years, somewhere around there.
Okay.
I guess you share a child together?
- Yeah.
- What's your daughter's name?
- Jesse.
- Okay.
So when was the last time you saw Rose?
Oh, man.
Uh...
- What day is today?
- Saturday.
Uh, just last night.
- So it was last night you were over there?
- Yeah, yeah, Friday night.
Do you remember about what time that was?
Like 11 something.
It was later, man, like she was coming from a date.
Why did you go over there?
Because, man, she's ignorant, and she stole money of mine.
- Did you get to talk to her?
- Yeah, I talked to her.
Was there anybody else there at the house when you were there?
Uh, I remember she had some chick on the couch.
Do you know who that person was?
No, not a clue.
Okay.
What did she look like?
Uh, looked like a person on a couch, man.
I don't know.
- So you didn't pay much attention to her?
- No, man.
Okay.
Did you confront Rose about her taking money from you?
- Hell yeah.
- Did you get into an argument?
Uh...
I don't know.
That's just kind of how we talk nowadays.
- Just tell me...
- Yeah, yeah, man!
She took my money.
I wanted my money back.
Okay.
She wasn't about to give it to me, or just even give me satisfaction of admitting she did it.
Did you guys get into a screaming match?
No, man.
The kid was sleeping upstairs.
So what happened?
Uh...
We...
I went in and asked her, "Where's my money?"
Like usual, she told me, "I don't have it.
I didn't take it."
She said, "Get the hell out of my house," and I left.
Do you have any idea why I'm here?
No, man.
Rose was murdered.
Whoa.
Okay.
Do you have any knowledge about who did that?
No, not me.
I know that much.
From looking around your apartment, I can tell you're a very passionate individual.
- Artistic and passionate.
- [Laughs]
Not passionate to beat her ass or anything, otherwise you probably would've heard of me a long time ago.
You've never been physical with her in the past?
No, man, not really.
So when you left, she was alive and everything was fine?
Well, I wouldn't say everything was fine, but she seemed to breathe and speak and move about.
So while you were there, you didn't get into any kind of physical altercation with her.
No, man!
So you're...
She's dead?
She's dead.
Wow, man.
Wow.
I need...
I need to call some people, man.
I need to see my daughter.
The darker the water, the darker the bait, which doesn't make any sense at all, but if the water you're going to be fishing in is real clear, you'll want the lighter colors.
...for the spinner rates, and they lock down.
And then there's little boxes that you can put whatever you please.
Hey, that is nice.
And how much does this run?
$18.95.
[Knocking]
- Kyle?
- Yeah.
I think you better come out here.
- Somebody wants to see you.
- All right.
It's a cop.
How long have you known Rose?
Oh, probably about a week now.
Okay, and what's your relationship with her?
Well, we worked together, and we were friends.
Uh, you know, we just met, so...
- When was the last time you saw Rose?
- I was with her last night.
Okay.
What did you guys do?
We went out for a couple beers, and we came back here for a little bit, then I took her home.
Was anybody else with you last night?
- No.
- Okay.
About what time did you drop her off home last night?
It was probably around 11:00.
Okay.
During the time that you were together, did she express any concerns that someone might want to hurt her?
[Kyle's mother] Something happen to her?
Yeah.
She was murdered last night.
- What?
- She was murdered.
- Where?
- At her home.
Do you know of anybody that would want to hurt her?
No.
She didn't say anything.
When you say you picked her...
What time did you pick her up last night?
Um, it was probably about 7:00. 6:00 or 7:00.
Did you go into her house when you stopped to pick her up?
Yeah, I went in.
Was there anybody else there?
Yeah.
Martha was there.
She was babysitting for her.
Who's Martha?
She's another girl I work with.
Does she have red hair?
Yeah.
[Martha] And then I also sew some doll clothes.
You do what?
I sew doll clothes in the evenings for the dolls.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It's a lot of fun.
You do that with anybody or just by yourself?
Just by myself.
My dad's at home, and that way I just spend some time with him.
He usually watches TV while I sew.
[Chuckles]
- Hi.
- Hi.
Is Kyle here?
- Yeah.
- Care if I come in?
- Come on in.
- How you doing?
I'm okay.
How are you doing?
Terrific.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Okay.
That's nice.
Hang on.
I'll get Kyle.
Kyle, Martha's here.
- Oh.
- I don't know.
- Hi.
What are you doing?
- Hey, Martha.
- I've been trying to get ahold of you.
- I've been out all day.
I went to the beauty parlor and went and bought a couple things.
- Has anybody talked to you yet?
- About what?
About Rose.
What about Rose?
She was killed last night.
She was murdered last night.
She was strangled.
- No.
- Yes.
- Last night?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
[Mother] There was a detective here today.
[Martha] You have got to be kidding me.
Yeah.
He just came in today and told us.
He asked me a bunch of questions.
And this happened last night.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, they were asking me because they thought I was the last one that seen her.
- Then I told him you were...
- Well, you brought her home when I was there.
Yeah.
You are not gonna believe this.
When I was there last night after you dropped her off, this guy started beating on the door, and she goes to the door and she opens it up, and he comes in.
He came in screaming and yelling.
She was okay when you left.
I mean, she was by herself.
She was fine, yeah.
When I left, she was fine.
But if he was waiting out there when you dropped her off, he was probably waiting on me to leave.
- Yeah.
- And he went back in there.
Oh, my God.
I can't even imagine.
I know.
It happened too fast.
I know.
Well, I got these for you.
Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you, Martha.
You're quite welcome.
Yeah, definitely, you have to call this detective too.
Oh, I will.
You'll have to give me the number.
[Police scanner]
- Hi.
How you doin'?
- Hello, Martha.
I'm Det.
Taylor from the police department.
I need to talk to you about Rose Hilliard.
Can I come in?
Oh, sure.
Come on in.
I heard from Kyle today, and he was telling me that something horrible had happened to Rose, that she'd been murdered.
- Can I come in and have a seat?
- Sure.
This is my father.
Sir, I'm from the police department.
I was just here to talk to your daughter.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
I mean, at first I thought she was a really sweet girl.
And then the longer you get to know her, the pushier she gets and the more favors she asks for.
I mean, it was just one favor right after the other one.
Did you feel like she took advantage of you?
A little bit, yeah.
Did she do that to other people?
I'm not really sure.
It seemed like she picked on me a lot.
She didn't really buddy up with the other employees.
She'd only been there a week.
Well, in talking with the witnesses in the area, they indicate that you were the last one that was seen leaving the residence.
[Martha] Well, I-I know that...
Well, I-I don't know.
I probably was.
I left after he did.
And that fact that, as far as the investigation is concerned, you were the last one that we know that saw her alive.
Okay.
At some point, I would like to get fingerprints from you to be able to compare to evidence that we collected at the scene.
Well, you know my fingerprints are gonna be there.
I was there.
Right, but there's other evidence that we have
- that would only be the killer's.
- Okay.
Would you be willing to come to the police department tonight and give me a set of fingerprints?
Okay.
I would have to get someone to take care of my dad.
And about how long will that take?
Shouldn't take more than 15, 20 minutes
- to get the fingerprints.
- Okay.
If you'd be able to do it tonight, it'd really help with the investigation.
I'll do anything I can to help.
- Hello, Martha.
- Detective.
Thanks for meeting with me again.
I just got a few more questions that we need to talk about,
- if that's okay.
- Okay.
Do you care if I record our conversation?
- No.
- Okay.
I'll just go ahead and start the tape.
What I like for you to do is go over the events again with me of Friday night.
Do you remember about what time Kyle came to the house?
No, I don't.
Okay.
Did Kyle come inside?
Yes, he did.
And did he stay very long?
No.
They, uh...
They talked a little bit, and, um...
They weren't there very long.
- Do you know where they went?
- No, I don't.
Okay, so when they left, it was just you and the small child.
- Yes.
- And what did you do that evening?
The child and I just played, and then I watched some TV and read some books and gave her some juice, and she went right to sleep.
Rose had told me that it wouldn't take her very long, and she was very good.
Okay.
Nothing unusual happened then?
- No.
- What time did Rose come home?
It was close to 11:00.
Okay, and did you immediately leave or...
No.
When she came in, we sat down and she asked me how Jesse was, and I asked her about her date.
And, uh...
Then, of course, that man came to the door.
Yeah, you told me that an individual came.
- Yes.
- It was her ex-boyfriend?
Right.
He had been...
I guess he had been sitting outside waiting on her.
- And did they argue?
- Yes, they sure did.
You told me that they had gotten into an argument.
Again, tell me what that was about.
He had said that she had stole some things from the apartment and some money.
How did it end with them?
Did it turn physical?
Well, there was a lot of yelling and...
I'm not sure whether he shoved her, but I know she had grabbed ahold of him to try to get him out the door.
Was she able to get him out of the house?
It took awhile.
Okay.
But he did ultimately leave the apartment.
Yes.
Yes, he did.
Did you see him any more that night?
No.
I didn't...
I just got in my car and left.
Okay, and where did you go when you left?
- I went straight home.
- Okay.
And I spoke to your dad the night that we talked, and he said you came home about the same time that you're saying.
Um...
Is there anything else that you can tell me at this point?
Well, the thing that, you know, really bothers me is that he was waiting outside on her to get home.
Uh-huh.
So what if he was still there after I left?
Okay.
Do you remember when we talked at your house and you indicated to me that you'd do anything you could to help with this investigation?
Yes, I did.
Well, what you need to do is start telling me the truth about what happened.
So I am.
We have got the physical evidence back from the lab, and it implicates you in the death of Rose Hilliard.
I don't see how.
How?
Your fingerprints were lifted off the bruises around her neck.
I don't understand it.
Now, Martha, this is the opportunity for you to help yourself here.
Now, either you are a cold-blooded killer,
- which I don't think is the case...
- No.
Or something happened in that apartment that caused you to do this.
There is no doubt that you did this.
None.
But only you can explain to me what happened, and I want you to do that.
I can't.
I just...
I don't know.
Is there any way that you can explain your fingerprints around her neck?
No, sir.
No, sir.
And the neighbors saw you leave the apartment.
You were the last one to leave the apartment.
The evidence is there.
You will be convicted of this.
You need to tell me the truth about what happened.
I don't know.
I-I don't know.
Well, the jury's not going to believe that.
I want you to look at these photographs.
That what she looks like.
That's what you did you her.
A jury's not gonna have sympathy for you if you don't show some kind of remorse.
Now, it can be explained how this happened.
Maybe you got into an argument with her, maybe things got out of hand.
But only you know that.
She can't tell us.
- I couldn't have done this.
- Well, you did.
No, sir.
No.
No.
Mr. Hightower, I wanted to come over and talk to you and let you know what's going on.
Okay.
I was wondering about it.
I just finished talking with Martha, and based upon my interview with her and evidence that we recovered from the scene, she's been arrested for the murder of Rose Hilliard.
Is that right?
And I wanted to come over and make you aware of what's going on because you are her family.
Yes.
She's currently at the jail and that's where she'll be until there's a hearing date.
What the hell.
Sorry to hear it.
Do you have any questions for me?
Do you know when her hearing will be?
It'll be fairly soon.
And they will give her an attorney.
Hey, Martha.
Hi, Kyle.
I'm really glad you came.
It's horrible in here.
Yeah?
So what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't understand.
I don't even know why I'm here, really.
And they think I killed her.
Kyle, you know me.
You know I could not have done that.
I think...
I really...
I think it's Jesse's dad.
And I can't...
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
You got to help me, Kyle.
You know that I would never do anything like this.
Yeah.
I-I don't understand.
And it seemed like the detective...
They think that I did this, and I don't see how.
I don't see how that can be right.
I don't know, Martha.
I don't understand it.
I don't know.
I don't know what, you know, what I did.
I know that I had a really, really, really bad headache, and when he started yelling, I just wanted to go home.
And I didn't know who he was, and when I tried to ask her who he was, she told me to mind my own business.
And that kind of made me feel bad because, I thought, you know, I thought I could talk to her like a daughter.
I mean, after all, she left me with, you know, her most prized possession:
Her baby.
Yeah.
And she's asked me for all kinds of favors, and I just didn't think it was too much to ask who he was.
And she was really mad and didn't want to talk about it.
I don't know, Martha.
You got to help me, Kyle.
You got to.
I mean, I don't what I can do, but...
I...
I don't know how this happened.
We have to figure this out.
We have to.
I didn't do it, Kyle.
You know I wouldn't do anything like that.
Yeah.
I don't know, Martha.
- I just...
I don't understand.
- I don't either.
[TV playing]
[Man] Good morning, everyone.
We've obviously gone through a very tragic set of events.
It is, um...
But we need move on, and because of that, we have gone out and we have hired Kyle's mom, Helen, with the idea that...
She can't take the two ladies' place because they are, you know...
We had a longtime employee and we had a short-time employee who was doing very well, but we feel like with, um...
Even though Kyle's mom doesn't have a lot experience, that you guys can work with her, get her up to speed just as soon as possible.
Hi.
You show me what to do.
I'll do the best I can.
Help you out.
Oh, my God.
This is a restricted area.
No filming here.
Show me an order, please.
It's enough that I say so.
-No, it isn't.
I said stop filming!
Hey, watch it.
Hands off, please.
Sir!
A bus.
Make them stop, then come to the bus.
Stay alert.
You're pissing me off.
Whatever.
Come on, everybody off.
Quickly, we don't have all day.
Everybody get in two lines.
All the men, pull your shirts up slowly.
You can't film here.
-Really?
Says who?
It's not up to me, you heard the officer.
I'm sorry, you can't just censor us like this.
Whatever.
I don't care.
Next.
Good.
Next.
I said slowly, so I can see.
Next.
You with the belly, show me what you have there.
I don't understand.
What does he want?
Let him see your belly.
Don't you understand?
Do as he says.
Good.
Fuck them.
-Stay calm, Jihad.
Now take out your ID's and move on.
Help us, please!
Her water broke, she needs help.
Please.
Call an ambulance!
Tell her I'm a medic, I can help.
He's like a doctor.
Don't be scared.
Send an ambulance.
There's a woman in labor here.
She can't breathe!
Relax.
-Where's the ambulance?
The ambulance is coming.
Don't be afraid.
Reassure her.
-I did.
Ask her where it hurts.
Where does it hurt?
The pain is terrible!
What is he doing?
Where is the doctor?
Stop it, you're scaring her.
How long for the ambulance?
The doctor's here.
What's going on?
-She's in labor.
Hello, I'm the doctor.
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
The baby's coming legs first.
Push, push, help me!
Push.
Push!
-Help me.
Harder.
Harder.
One more push and he's out.
-One more, one more.
He's out!
Something is wrong.
Where is my son?
.
She wants the baby.
-Give him CPR.
Pulse?
.
-No.
OK, starting CPR.
I'm sorry.
He has no pulse.
There is nothing we can do.
You killed that baby!
You killed him!
Have you no shame?
.
Enough of that, Jihad.
-Stay out of it.
Don't you even care?
.
Everybody back in line.
Nothing happened here.
Back in line.
Get your IDs ready, come on.
"The Third Ear"
Excuse me?
.
Excuse me?
.
Do you have the new Britney compilation?
.
Who's that?
.
It's called "My Prerogative".
And the DVD too.
-What's a "Prerogative"?
.
It's her new video.
She's got blond hair.
Don't know it.
How about the new Rolling Stones set?
.
Open your ears a bit.
Yeah, right.
Let's get out of here.
Bad time there?
.
Yes?
.
I like the atmosphere here.
No uniforms, chilled-out waiters, I think I'll fit in perfect.
I've been here a few times.
Sometimes it takes half an hour to get a table, but it's worth it.
The sweet potato pancakes and the rice pilaf!
I know the owners are girls, so all the waiters are boys...
But that's so over.
Why pass on a girl like me?
.
I ran a bar in Netanya, but I don't mind starting from the bottom.
In two months I'll be running the place.
But I run the place.
-We'll run it together.
No problem.
Or I can open a branch at the Azrieli Mall.
I was there yesterday.
They don't have one.
We're not a franchise.
There's only this branch.
So think big!
Golan is here now!
The last one wasn't bad.
That small-town boy?
.
You can't be serious.
He's so not our type.
Maybe it's time to change our type.
Don't all our waiters look like brothers?
.
That's a thought.
Yali, if you like him, then date him.
But don't lecture us, OK?
.
What's up?
.
-Our soldier's back.
It's him?
.
-Yeah.
I need a few minutes.
-Take your time.
I'm here.
So, what's new here?
.
What about your new guy?
.
-What about him?
.
No progress.
I haven't even seen him yet.
Why should it progress?
.
Has the world progressed?
.
It actually has.
-No, it hasn't.
All guys want the moming after is to run.
They don't want any baggage or commitment.
The only way to avoid that is to take it slow.
So when the male instinct whispers..
"Run, she's clinging!"
He'll remember those walks on the beach, and the movies we saw and maybe he'll reconsider and stick around.
How long have you been holding out?
.
-Three weeks.
Isn't three weeks taking it a bit too slow?
.
I don't know why Sharon has this effect on you,
Miss "Israeli Carrie Bradshaw".
But if you want to keep him, it's time to give it up.
Really?
.
And the guys on your reserve duty?
.
Nothing to tell.
-No one?
.
No sexy suicide bombers?
.
Don't start.
I won't go back, I swear.
Hi, Sharon...
Busy?
.
An editorial meeting?
.
Nothing special.
Why don't you come over tonight?
.
Yes, my place.
You've been wanting to, right?
.
Maybe we could rent a DVD.
No, I don't really feel like going out.
Why?
.
Oh, my roommates?
.
Going to Sinai.
They're going to Sinai.
Israeli Pop Idol
I can't believe you're watching that crap.
Don't exaggerate.
We're not really going.
Call my mother, tell her you like the food.
She brought it just for you.
You look great!
Time to go!
In a second.
-You can't stay.
Just to see Mr. Editor.
Noam is dying to.
No.
I found your ID.
I thought you might need it.
I didn't notice, thank you.
Come in.
My roommates,
Yali, Lulu.
This is...
I'm Ashraf.
Ashraf was with me on duty.
I mean, that's where we met.
What's up?
.
Is this a bad time?
.
We're just the roommates.
I'm Yali.
This is Noam.
And that's Ashraf.
Ashraf?
.
Nice to meet you all.
Weren't you in a hurry, boys?
.
You might miss your bus.
Yali, we're going for cash first.
Meet us by the Eilat platform.
I'll just be a second...
I forgot my snorkel.
Tel Aviv, Ashraf.
Ashraf, Tel Aviv.
The sea is over there, but you can't see it.
The European idiots who built the city in the 1920s didn't know much about the Mediterranean.
They put its back to the sea.
Streets run parallel to the sea and block the breeze.
Then the tall hotels blocked everything.
That's why there's no air.
Are you sweating?
.
I'm sweating.
I'm really sweating.
Maybe Yali packed those towels he stole from the gym.
So that's how Jews kiss.
Don't you like it?
.
Sure I do.
But I thought we could...
Take it farther?
.
Yeah, take it farther.
Golan?
.
Great shirt.
Yes, I know.
So many fags.
-Problem?
.
I hate them.
I'm gay.
I'm not a girl.
We're all free.
They like being feminine.
Are you joking?
.
Who wants to be a biter?
.
A biter?
.
Pillow biter...
Never heard that?
.
So you're a fudge packer?
.
Just joking.
Don't be so touchy.
So naive.
What are these?
.
-I designed them.
They're nice.
-Just T-shirts for my friends.
But I'm actually serious about fashion design.
I'm thinking of studying in New York next year.
New York is the best.
-So I've heard.
Maybe I'll go to Paris.
Albert Elbaz started in NY, got famous, and then moved to Paris to become the designer for Lanvin.
But he's some kind of genius, isn't he?
.
And you think I'm not?
.
Of course you are.
I'm sure you can make it.
There are so many talented people in Tel Aviv.
All you need is to get out into the world, and make a name for yourself.
What's wrong?
.
Nothing.
So why do you look scared?
.
What are you afraid of?
.
-You, kind of.
You're scared of me?
.
Never mind, forget it.
Forget it?
.
forget it.
So, that's how Arabs do it.
Don't you like it?
.
Sure I do.
I just thought maybe we could take it farther.
It was awful.
Us?
.
Didn't you...
Not us.
That woman at the checkpoint.
Lots of stories like that.
Jihad, the guy near me at the checkpoint...
He's engaged to my sister.
His father had a heart attack.
His ambulance was stopped at checkpoint.
They searched it.
They held it for an hour.
He died at the hospital entrance.
If they hadn't stopped him...
You know why they have checkpoints?
.
They weren't always there.
Don't start your propaganda.
Forget politics.
You thought I said we were awful?
.
-Maybe.
We were explosive!
Explosive?
.
Don't you know that word?
.
I know it.
When you explode something, like a bomb.
It can mean cool, too.
Explosive, explosion, explode.
Good sex is explosive.
Explosive.
No Sharon for breakfast?
.
-He went spinning before work.
Morning spinning.
What a catch!
Delicious!
People forget how sexy a simple sliced tomato can taste.
My battery's out.
Can I use your phone?
.
Sure.
Thanks.
Is he staying?
.
Where can he go?
.
He has no permit.
If he's caught, they'll arrest him and send him back.
Are we going to keep him in the closet?
.
Stop it.
Being gay isn't easy over there.
I don't want to stay.
I won't marry Jihad's cousin.
Why are they pushing me?
.
Take it easy.
Where are you now?
.
In Jerusalem, at a friend's house.
They'll kill me if they find out.
What?
.
Who will kill you?
.
Are you mad?
.
Who is she anyway?
.
Do I know her?
.
She's a Christian... and a divorcée
Does she have kids?
.
-Kids?
.
No, no.
So how are you doing?
.
I miss you.
-I miss you too.
Don't worry, we'll see each other soon.
I took my last exam today.
I'm leaving Jordan in a few days.
Are you sure about him?
.
He's become so extreme.
He could cause trouble for us.
Listen, he's the man I love.
Jihad is a sensible guy.
He promised to stop soon.
After the wedding, we'll be far from all that, here in Jordan.
What are you doing?
.
I'm reminding you:
"The roommates agree to uphold a strict guest policy.
"A hook-up lasting more than one week...
"Hoping there wouldn't be such a case...
"This would require the approval of all roommates.
"Maximum stay is two weeks.
"14 nights, then he must go."
Yali, all we ever do is talk.
How many times did we promise my mom we'd go to Checkpoint-Watch?
.
This is a chance to do something important.
Is this a political affair?
.
Stop it!
We can help someone.
OK!
I won't be accused of killing the Israeli left.
I surrender!
Good.
What do you think awaits a gay suicide bomber in heaven?
.
Seventy virgin twinks or seventy muscle hunks?
.
Think he can choose?
.
Golan, I'm really sorry,
Orna owes this guy a favor.
I know what I said yesterday.
I'm really sorry.
Someone leaves every month.
You're next on the list.
No, I just said hi to the security guard.
"Orna Ella"
Another date?
.
Let's talk later.
Do you have the Pop Idol CD?
.
Of course.
How could we not?
.
There, on the right.
See what 24 hours on Sheinkin St can do?
.
You're a new man!
Probably got some last night...
Does it show?
.
-Good for you, man.
Can I help you?
.
-Not right now, thanks.
Hey, what's up?
.
Still in the editorial meeting?
.
OK, later.
No problem.
This color is so Arabic.
Smells Arabic too.
Excuse me, what's in this soap?
.
Don't you like it?
.
Sorry, I don't.
Our policy is only great-smelling soaps.
Customers aren't allowed to criticize our soaps.
I don't like your tone.
That soap smells better than you do.
How dare you!
Who do you think you are?
.
I apologize She didn't mean that.
Let's get out of here.
I need some fresh air.
-Take your time, chill.
Hey sweetie!
Hi.
Chiki's in the house, wipe off the sour face.
I have to get out of there.
I'm wasting time.
That job isn't forever.
Never mind.
The bastard is screening my calls!
-What?
.
Nothing, forget it.
Look at the cool stickers we made.
Can I stick one here?
.
-No, crazy!
Outside, or they'll think I did it.
"Rave Against the Occupation"
Cool, it's better with the sleeves rolled up.
Are you sure?
.
Do these colors work?
.
He has to dress right to work at the café
Orna and Ella don't know the truth.
He needs a belt.
He also needs a new name and a whole new biography.
Wow, this belt looks great.
Don't move.
I always had fantasies about George Michael.
I had fantasies about the entire wall.
You liked George Michael?
.
Who did you fantasize about at 15?
.
River Phoenix, Morrissey,
Chris Lowe from the Pet Shop Boys...
There were a lot.
Him and that sad little indie world of those suffering singers!
Jerk!
You love what I play.
And the minute you leave he puts on "Take That".
Jason Orange!
Jason Orange, the sweet hard-ons of high school.
Jason, the sweet dancer, I was so in love with him.
When they broke up I wanted to go to London and find him.
Wait a minute, who did you like in "Take That"?
.
Robbie, of course.
And you?
.
You're such an awful snob!
Actually we're missing a picture of Michel Foucault, to replace Stephen from Boyzone.
-Shut up.
What's wrong?
.
A little culture, some tradition...
We're all one people that way, at least.
I can't wear that.
That's much better.
My clothes work best on him.
But there's not much to choose from.
Ashraf, follow me.
My dear, I sense your mood is not fabulous, but I can make it better.
Allow me to interest you in my new script.
It's a fascinating story.
-I'd be delighted.
I know you are writing the part just for me.
No other actress in town could play such a role.
Waiter!
One second.
Stick close to me, and repeat everything I say.
Good evening.
No, no...
That's exactly what we don't do.
Be casual.
Thank you very much, you're sweet.
What's your name?
.
Oh, what should we call him?
.
He needs a Hebrew name.
I worked for an Israeli contractor.
He gave us all Hebrew names.
He called me Shimi.
Shimi, like Shimon, right?
.
Or short for Samson.
"Let my soul die with the Philistines."
History's first suicide bomber.
-Stop it.
Why not?
.
I am Shimi.
Want some Kebab, Hummus, Tehina?
.
How come you don't have an accent?
.
No problem, if you want I bring it right back.
I take your bicture?
.
We no habe work, no habe money, we just want the beace, really.
I didn't mean that, you know.
It's OK.
It's really unusual.
When I was young I worked at my uncle's souvenir shop in Jerusalem.
We had Jewish customers, so I leamed.
I thought it might be useful.
My uncle used to joke: "This one talks like a Jew, that's no good."
You must try our famous sweet potato pancakes.
Here are the shirts.
Alright people, let's sit down.
We have a lot to discuss.
Be careful with the chairs.
I promised we'd leave this place in good shape.
The slave labor arrives at 5 AM to clean up anyway.
Don't start arguing.
Yes, let's save the arguments for another time.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Plan.
We leave Tel Aviv in a convoy of cars.
We'll drive up toward Tel-Baruch Beach.
And make our way to the rave location!
Question.
What about the police?
.
-I don't think we'll have any trouble.
The police only look for raves in the desert.
They came last time, they could come again.
If they show up this time, we must fight back.
-Fight back!
Hold on.
Now my idea for the poster.
"Rave Against the Occupation"
I want everybody naked, wearing only fig leaves.
I used the colors of the Palestinian and Israeli flags.
Maybe we can do without those colors, to draw a bigger crowd.
We could always use the flags of Denmark and Sweden.
They're pretty and they don't piss anybody off.
Don't be so cynical.
All I'm saying is, the poster doesn't need the old politics.
It can be more subtle:
we're young and against war.
Where?
.
In New Zealand?
.
Maybe we should invite some Palestinians.
We never have any.
We haven't succeeded.
Anyone know any young Palestinians who can come to our meetings?
.
Yeah, right.
This is bullshit!
How could they come?
.
They can't get permits!
You're all so disconnected!
You're living in denial.
Go to the checkpoints!
Ever been to the West Bank?
.
And you?
.
I just spent a month on reserve duty at a checkpoint.
You didn't refuse?
.
Hey, we're here for the poster.
Talk politics later.
Bye, Lulu.
Want one?
.
There are lots left.
The shirts are great.
You're really talented.
Thanks.
So where are you going now?
.
For a drink with the boys.
OK, so I'll see you.
Cool place, right?
.
Golan's coming.
Don't mention Shimi works at the café.
He'll kill me.
What's this?
.
It's a new production of "Bent".
-"Bent?"'
Yeah, it's a famous play.
A love story about two men in a concentration camp.
It's with Lior Ashkenazi.
Yummy!
We've got to go!
Do you like theater?
.
I do.
But I've never seen a play in Hebrew.
What's up, bro?
.
Meet my friends, Lulu, Noam.
I told you about them.
And this is Shimi, Noam's friend.
Is your friend Palestinian?
.
Your shorts look a bit Palestinian.
Sorry about Golan.
He got out of the army two years ago, but he still has the mentality of a Golani trooper.
And proud of it!
Golan, a Golani trooper forever!
Maybe his trooper friends should know what he does at night.
Sister, my friends know exactly what I do.
I came out like a man and they took it like men.
These are my brothers, sweetheart.
We busted our asses together, fought terrorists in the Hebron Casbah.
Believe me...
In the trenches, any minute some dog might shoot you from behind...
You learn it doesn't matter.
As long as he's protecting you, who cares if he's straight or gay?
.
I need a drink.
Anyone coming along?
.
No, we'll stay.
We hate Arabs too.
Did I say something wrong?
.
Your friends don't like army talk?
.
What can I get you?
.
I'm leaving.
-What happened?
.
"14-Year-Old Boy Killed in Jenin by Occupation Forces"
What are you doing?
.
Just reading news from home.
What's going on there?
.
-The usual stuff.
Come on, pound me!
Pound me?
.
Pound me!
Problem?
.
I don't know...
-Consummate sound better?
.
Sexual intercourse?
.
Then just nail me from behind!
You're so drunk.
It's not from the wine!
Not in the hallway, bro.
Who's that woman?
.
My mother.
Where does she live?
.
She doesn't.
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
-It's OK.
We used to live in Jerusalem.
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
I want to be your whore.
Yes!
Yes, Mama!
Yes!
Fuck me.
Yes, Mama!
Yes!
Fuck me, Mama, fuck me!
Mama...
Fuck me.
-I want to be your whore.
Perverts.
Mama!
Mama!
I'll ask his army friends to pound you.
Bring them on, I'm getting hot.
Please.
Good morning Sheinkin Street!
We would like to invite you to the best party in town.
A rave against the occupation.
A rave for peace.
You are all welcome to come to the rave on October 23.
We don't need the territories, we need to dance!
Rave against the occupation!
A party for peace!
We all want peace, right?
.
We all want the same thing.
Dance!
Dance!
Dance!
A rave for peace, let's all show up.
Let's dance instead of shoot!
Let's all show up.
Don't you ever learn?
.
Don't you ever change?
.
The new generation wants peace.
-What do you know?
.
Ever had an 8-year-old's leg fall on your face after a bombing?
.
Make them stop pushing me.
They're hitting me.
They're crazy.
Animals!
I could punch them!
Morons.
Are you OK?
.
-Better now.
I'm on the verge of losing it.
What are you talking about?
.
-I'm sick of everything.
"Time Out Tel Aviv"
Come on.
Lulu?
.!
What's up with her?
.
Lulu.
Where's Sharon?
.
-End of the hall, to the right.
Is he expecting you?
.
-He should be.
Hey, how are you?
.
Fuck you.
That's how I am.
What kind of talk is that?
.
Fuck you, loser.
Who do you think you are?
.
Take it easy.
Shut up.
You think you're "50 Cent" and I'm your bitch?
.
Why did you chase me for a month?
.
Just to get laid, run off and avoid my calls?
.
What kind of behavior is that?
.
I came here to tell you about a porn site.
It's for the world's smallest dicks.
They'll pay a fortune for yours.
Let's go.
They call it the "bubble", because nothing here is real.
Look around.
These people have no connection to reality.
Kibbutz life is a bubble, too.
West Bank settlements are bubbles.
Who can say anymore what's real and what's a bubble?
.
Maybe...
You're new here?
.
-Yes.
So this is for you.
-Thank you.
What's your name?
.
-Shimi.
Shimi.
A pretty name for a pretty boy.
Everything cool?
.
-Look at the tip I got.
She pulls that trick on every new waiter.
Once she finds out you're gay, she'll go back to being cheap.
Someone's here for you.
Hello.
-Hey.
You're new here?
.
That lady just pulled that on me.
At least she left me a nice tip.
Tips are nice.
But I've got something better.
Tonight, after the photo shoot for Lulu's poster,
I'm taking you to the theater.
Listen, do you...
What?
.
Miss it?
.
What?
.
You know.
Yes.
-We don't have to.
What?
.
Miss it.
We're here together.
We don't have to miss it.
We can't look at each other.
We can't touch.
We can feel...
-Feel what?
.
Each other.
Without looking.
Without touching.
I can feel you right now.
Next to me.
Can you feel me?
.
Maybe.
Don't worry.
He won't hear us.
Feel me.
No.
-I'm touching you.
It's burning.
-I'm kissing you.
Burning
-Kissing your lips.
Hot.
-Kissing your eyes.
Yes.
-Inside your mouth.
Yes.
-Neck.
Yes.
-Down.
Yes.
-Down.
Yes.
-Do you feel my mouth?
.
Do you feel my cock?
.
Do you know what I am doing?
.
Can you taste what I am doing?
.
-Yes.
Together.
-Together.
Do you feel me?
.
-I want you inside me.
Feel.
-I have you inside me.
Inside.
-Strong.
I'm going to...
-Strong.
Do you feel...
I'm going to...
-Strong.
Strong.
-Yes.
Strong.
-Yes.
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Did you?
.
Yes.
You?
.
-Yes.
You're a good lay.
-So are you.
Max?
.
-What?
.
We did it.
How about that.
Fucking guards, fucking camp, we did it.
We were real.
We made love.
They're not going to kill us.
I like that thing they did, running a finger over their eyebrow, instead of saying "l love you."
Luckily we don't need that.
Maybe in Tel Aviv you don't.
Where are you from in Jerusalem?
.
-French Hill.
Really?
.
You know I used to live in lssawiya.
Really?
.
How come you never told me?
.
I was very young when we left, I don't remember much.
Maybe we were neighbors.
-Yeah, something like that.
My father was born there, all his family is from Jerusalem.
So you have an Israeli ID?
.
-I used to.
We used to live at my grandparents' house.
When my younger sister was born, it got crowded.
So my father started building us a new house.
He borrowed money, opened his savings account.
Built the house himself, with family and friends.
It was coming along great.
My sister and I used to run around, deciding who would get which room.
And then we got a demolition warrant.
And what happened?
.
-What happened?
....
One day a tractor came and tore it all down.
My mom stood outside screaming, but nothing helped.
Within an hour, it was gone.
What did you do?
.
-I was just a kid, what could I do?
.
I threw rocks at the tractor.
But my father stopped me.
That evening he told us we were moving to a place that was our own.
We left.
Returned our IDs and moved to Nablus.
My mother argued with him.
She said Israeli IDs would be good to have.
But my father refused.
He couldn't take it.
You scared me.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
.
I didn't think there was anything to see.
So, how was the play?
.
Interesting, lots of food for thought.
You should go.
Yeah, as I said pretty clearly at the Breakfast Club,
I really want to see it.
Oh...
-Never mind, it's no big deal.
Yali, I'm so sorry, I totally forgot.
Forget it.
Focus on yourself.
You do that so well.
What's that mean?
.
It means what it means.
-Do you want to talk about it?
.
I don't have anything to say.
-OK.
I just think that something isn't right.
It's not right that I'm happy?
.
-Of course you're happy...
If he's not straight, or in a relationship, or a tourist, at least let him be...
Never mind, let's change the subject.
Come on, say it.
How should I put it?
.
We've always tried to keep away from politics.
We don't go to checkpoints with Lulu's mom.
We try to just live and...
Don't you get it?
.
Sorry to rain on your parade, but...
He's really sweet and I watch over him at the café, but...
Somehow it doesn't feel real.
So what do you suggest?
.
I don't know, Noam.
Just more food for thought.
I'll talk to him about the nudity.
Don't you trust me?
.
Leave it to me.
OK, he's here.
Bye.
What's up?
.
-How are you?
.
For me, a double espresso, thanks.
-I'll have a Corona.
No problem.
So, what is this about?
.
Alright.
As I told you, it's our Spring Special.
Every celebrity we choose gets a two-page spread, and recommends the hottest things of the hour.
And you get the cover.
-Who's in it?
.
Artists.
Celebs.
People of the hour.
You, with your new play, "Bent."
Camilla, the winner from "Big Brother".
Mali Levi, with her new jeans campaign, you know.
What concept did you have in mind?
.
-It'll be a huge production.
You, in the center, naked.
Around you, fifteen naked girls...
Did you even see the play?
.
-Of course I did.
Quality stuff.
But hey.
The play is one thing and the Spring Special is another.
Face it.
The Holocaust is not sexy.
And my cover has to be sexy.
Yeah, I guess the Holocaust isn't that sexy.
There you go.
-Thanks.
How are you?
.
-Excuse me?
.
Don't you remember me?
.
-Remind me.
You remember, we met at Lulu's apartment, and then at Time Out.
You must remember that.
Maybe you're confusing me with someone else.
Don't be scared.
I wanted to talk to you about doing a story.
"Tel Aviv through the eyes of a Palestinian."
Excuse me a moment.
Yali, I'm sorry, I have to...
Where did he go?
.
I hope I didn't scare him.
What did you say to him?
.
Just that I want to do a story about him.
A story about him?
.
You got any more Palestinians working here?
.
We could do a group piece.
-What?
.
They're all legal, right?
.
-What do you mean?
.
He's gone.
OK...
Maybe we'll talk about it some other time.
Why didn't you tell us, silly?
.
Open the window,
My darling one
Let the wind blow in Mix the outside with the inside...
My God, it stinks in here.
You need air.
Your crotch smell is all over town.
The neighbors are asking if there's a corpse in here.
Look, sweetie, hop into the shower.
Take a walk, then go back to bed.
Diet-wise, it's great.
Like a double Yom Kippur.
Cleans the blood wonderfully.
I'll give you some onion pills to totally clean your system.
It's your mom.
Yes, mom.
I timed mine off for a sec.
No, Ashraf isn't here.
He went back to Nablus, why?
Today in Nablus Air Force Apache helicopters fired missiles at a car driven by Riyad Bek, leader of the military arm of Hamas.
Security officials claim that Bek was part of an attempt to launch local cells of AI-Qaeda.
Hamas vowed to avenge...
No answer.
I keep sending him messages.
I don't know what to do.
What do we do about him?
Tell me...
Do you think I can pass for a TV reporter going to the territories?
Someone like Christiane Amanpour?
Have you gone crazy too?
I have an idea.
I have a great idea.
"Rave against the occupation"
Shaul.
Shaul.
I wanted to bring you one, but I thought it would be cooler if you saw them already up.
They look good.
-Good?
They looks great.
Thanks to you.
You're the best.
Thanks.
Listen, I would love to stay and help, but I have to run.
Anything happen?
Actually, a lot's happened.
I'll tell you some other time.
Promise?
-Promise.
Sharon?
The trouble girl is on her way to your office.
It's OK, she's here.
I'll take care of it.
What do you want?
Don't make me call the police.
Chill, you have a chance to help me and get a cease-fire.
Help you with what?
-I need press cards.
Press cards?
-Yes, temporary cards.
Like the ones you got us for the rock gig.
You can cut out these pictures.
We need to get through checkpoints.
We're going to Nablus.
-Nablus?
Yes.
To do a story.
About what?
About how Palestinian men act the morning after.
Don't start that again.
Yali did a great job with the car.
I'm telling you, he could be an art director in movies.
He said to put this up in front.
-He put a lot of work into this.
But he bailed out on the trip.
It's impossible to get him out of Tel-Aviv.
We should switch to English.
We can't use Hebrew there.
Sounds bad.
They'll know immediately you're Israeli.
Do a French accent.
No one will know.
You're crazy, I can't talk like that.
There's the checkpoint.
I hope no one recognizes me.
Next in line.
Move on.
Put down the suitcase.
Open the suitcase.
Take it out.
Give it to me.
Sorry.
What's that?
It's Henna, for the wedding.
Give it to me.
Let me see.
You sure it's Henna?
Henna.
Check if it's Henna.
It is.
-You can pack.
Close the door.
What are you doing here?
You want them to kill me?
I was worried about you.
I'm sorry, I wanted to call back.
You don't know what it's like here.
I'm sorry.
You're really crazy.
Jihad!
Wait.
You can't tell anyone.
I never thought you were one of those.
Promise me you won't tell!
I won't ruin the most beautiful week of your sister's life.
Did you invite them?
No.
They'll leave.
-Now!
Make them leave!
-Promise me.
T.ill the wedding.
After that, only Allah knows.
My cousin Samira will be at the wedding.
You must marry her.
If you do, maybe I won't say anything.
Why do this?
-It's that way.
I missed you.
Welcome.
Are you OK?
Are you sure?
I was so scared.
Let me speak to him.
Don't you see he's a wreck?
You must come to the rave.
Know where it is?
He misses you terribly.
She's right.
I really do.
Why didn't you invite Golan?
He doesn't fit in.
-Why not?
But I'll find someone.
Plenty to choose from.
What a relief.
And you, Mr. Depression?
-What about me?
Have some MDMA.
What for?
For fun, dummy.
You did it!
-What do you mean?
Fashionably late Comrade Ashraf.
What an entrance.
You're getting bitchy!
I'm only kidding.
Aren't jokes allowed anymore?
I'm so happy you came.
-I didn't think I would make it.
The checkpoints took hours, then getting into Israel, hitchhiking through the mountains, And then... you don't need the details.
I'm really happy you're here.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Is this a private party?
Got a strict door policy?
No, I'm glad you came but...
Because it's a rave?
I'm into causes, too.
I'm totally left-wing, bro.
See you.
I saved us some.
I thought you might come.
I'm so happy you came.
Open wide.
Say ah!
You're such a sucker.
That's the first trick in Golan's book.
I dance with someone else...
You get jealous and come crawling.
What do you want?
Stop being so heavy.
Dance with me, man!
Did it kick in?
What?
Yeah, I guess it did.
Go get her...
She's not waiting for me.
You know, I love you.
-Really?
Really.
And I want us to make love.
And then get married, and have lots of children.
Are you rolling on X?
No, it's real.
It's not because I'm high.
I really feel it.
OK.
I'll decide later if I join you or let you do it alone.
Remember the playground between French Hill and lssawiya?
Yeah, the Jews' playground.
We never went there.
At first, all the kids played there, until we were about 6 years old.
Maybe we even played there together.
I don't think so, I would have spotted you.
I'm joking.
My father was our neighborhood committee president.
There were complaints about Arab kids scaring the other kids.
So he got an order preventing the lssawiya kids from playing there.
My mother had a terrible fight with him.
She invited all the mothers and kids from lssawiya to come to a reconciliation party at the playground.
My father laughed at her "attempt at World Peace."
He said no one would come.
And on the day of the party, no one did.
Not even the Israeli mothers.
Later we found out they were scared off.
We sat there drinking juice and eating cake.
She pushed me high on the swings.
Back home, my father and brother were watching soccer on TV.
Later, in the bath, I noticed my Mom had tears in her eyes.
She was trying to wipe them away, so I pretended I didn't see them.
I know it sounds crazy, but I think that was the day the illness began in her body.
Somehow, I'm sure of that.
I just love the city on Saturday mornings.
Tel Aviv has such beautiful moments.
Yeah, like now, when everything is quiet and calm.
I really love Tel Aviv.
It's a shame it's surrounded by such crap.
If we could only make all the politics disappear.
Why didn't you invite Shaul?
- What for?
We saw you two.
It seemed so nice and romantic.
And what about Golan?
Don't change the subject, we're talking about Shaul.
He was high on X.
-High on you!
What's the matter?
He's sexy.
-He was wasted.
"l swear it's not because I'm rolling.
"I'm in love with you, you're beautiful and I really wanna fuck you.
"Is anal an option?"'
Can you really play?
-Sure.
I wanted to be a rock star.
Really?
In high school, we even had a band, "The Sirens."
We used to cover classics.
Do you know Tim Buckley?
No.
During the army I quit music and never really came back to it.
And now it's too late.
It's not too late.
We're still young.
You can do anything you want.
At my age?
-"At my age?"'
Very funny.
Come on, sing something.
I want to hear you sing.
Come on.
-Really?
Yeah?
This is a song my mother loved, she always wanted me to play it for her.
You don't have to.
I want to.
Wait a second.
What was her name?
-Whose name?
Your mother's.
Sarah.
Her name was Sarah.
I wanted to say ""my love"" in Arabic, but you never taught me how.
Anyway, I'm off to work.
Have a nice trip back.
Have fun at the wedding.
And say ""Mazal Tov"" to your sister.
Maybe you shouldn't say it's from me.
But come back to me soon.
Very soon.
How did you sleep?
-Like a rock.
You?
Me too.
Excuse me, is this lemon or lemongrass?
I can't really tell from here but it says on the label.
What's up?
Remember what I told you last night?
I was totally wasted, I don't remember much.
I said I wanted us to get married, have kids.
You said I was just high.
Don't you remember?
Sort of.
Well, it's true.
I want us to be together.
What?
Right now?
From this very second?
Yes.
OK.
But do we really have to get married?
I'm not up for the whole religious thing.
No way.
You're the boss.
It's OK.
You're not bothering me, I'm just smelling soap.
Stop, not here.
I'm going to "Erez" for bread.
I'll come back later.
Go on, it's very sweet.
Alright.
Come on.
Put down the bags.
Come on.
Come on.
Open the bags so the soldier can see what's in there.
Come on, let's see.
Have your IDs ready.
Excuse me, soldier, these people are guests coming to my sister's wedding.
Maybe you could please...
-What are they to you?
They're guests for my sister's wedding.
Where are you from?
Nablus.
Hello, Ashraf.
Welcome.
Sorry for the delay.
Don't worry, they'll let you through in a minute.
You'll be on time, God willing.
What does he want?
I don't know.
Ashraf Sirtawi from Nablus.
Stay out of this.
Get in line with the others.
-Hey, I was just explaining...
You understand Hebrew, right?
Get in line before I have you detained.
They're my sister's guests...
Stand aside!
Am I clear?
How are you, gorgeous?
Thank God you're here!
What's up?
Jihad hasn't arrived yet.
Stop worrying.
He'll be here soon.
Jihad's mother was here and she started talking about naming our baby after Jihad's father.
What baby?
I have so much to do before that.
I need to find work, finish my studies, make sure we have everything...
Then we'll see.
Forget it, it's just talk.
You just think about the wedding.
You think so?
-Yes.
What's happening with you?
You've become fashionable.
-Don't like it?
-It's very nice.
Where are the clothes from?
From her?
Who is she?
I don't care if she's divorced, tell me!
Remember the news team that was here when you arrived?
That beautiful French girl?
You're my sister, eventually you'll have to know.
Don't make it sound like a Jordanian soap opera!
Is that French girl Jewish?
Not an Israeli!
-No, it's not her...
The guy that was with her.
Noam, from Tel Aviv.
What about him?
He's very nice, really.
I don't understand.
What about him?
No, you do understand.
I love him and...
I don't understand and neither do you!
You're just confused.
Where did you get these ideas?
First she's French, then a Christian divorcée, and now it's a guy?
Where does this nonsense come from?
It's those American movies you watch.
Why are you like this?
-Me?
Why are you like this?
Have you gone mad?
This conversation is over.
I have to do my makeup.
We'll talk later.
Please, if you love me, you must understand me.
No, you understand me!
That's enough.
We'll talk after the wedding.
Surprising choice... think it will work?
I get goose bumps when I sing it...
Who was that?
-Golan.
I'm not in the mood.
Why are you so mean to him?
He was so sweet at the rave, I saw everything.
I'm not into him.
-Does he know?
No.
-So tell him.
He'll figure it out.
-Why is an asshole?
Can't you tell him?
He won't cut his wrists.
Men are such stupid animals.
Please, no Judith Butler now.
It's the semi-finals!
No lectures.
-I can't understand why men, after all the revolutions, are still so emotionally crippled.
And you gays are the worst.
Call him now.
Meet him, and tell him.
Now!
OK.
Hey, sweetie.
Just getting ready for the "Pop Idol semi-finals.
Never mind.
You feel like having coffee?
No, not at "Orna and Ella", let's go to Café Bialy.
Eight o'clock?
OK.
Bye.
Congratulations.
What's happening?
-Everything's according to plan.
Go up to Samira.
She's waiting.
Go to her.
Hello.
-Hi.
How are you?
-Good.
And you?
The truth?
So so.
Uptight about your sister's wedding?
-Yes, a little.
What are you doing these days?
I'm studying here, in college.
You know how it is here, the level isn't too high.
I want to study architecture abroad.
-Really?
I want to go to London, I've got relatives there.
London.
Not bad.
They've got great music.
They have it all.
Maybe you should come too.
You'll be better off there.
Things will never get better here.
And you'll escape Jihad and his stupid friends.
I want to go dance a little.
I'll be back later.
-OK.
Dropped him off in Tel Aviv?
I can't hear.
You're breaking up.
Dropped him off in Tel Aviv?
Great.
Great.
May Allah bless you.
I'll wait to hear it on the radio.
Goodbye.
A bomb!
-Are you sure?
.
And not far away.
I'll see what happened.
Lulu, did you hear?
.
-Good, it's you.
It was really big.
The whole house shook.
I thought something would break.
Something broke?
.
No, nothing, I think.
Where's Yali?
.
He went out for coffee, a date with Golan.
Hold on, I have a call.
Noam, that was Golan.
He was late.
The bomb was at Café Bialik.
What?
.
You're here!
I mean alive.
You're alive.
We were worried sick.
We thought the worst.
You are OK, right?
.
-Yes, our sweet Yali is fine.
Don't get emotional on me.
I don't need drama queens.
I've been declared "moderately wounded".
It doesn't even hurt.
I just can't feel my legs.
They say it's the injections.
You'll be fine, I'm sure.
We're Yali's roommates.
I'm Lulu, this is Noam.
Good thing you got here fast.
We were waiting.
We panicked.
When we called the hospital, the line was busy.
I was scared to come directly here.
My mother called a doctor friend.
That's how we knew.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
I realized I forgot my wallet.
That's why I was late.
I got there a few seconds after the explosion.
I brought you purple flowers, your favorite color.
Is that him?
.
Answer him.
He must be worried.
It's alright.
I'll talk to him later.
Answer already.
Noam, where are you?
.
Answer me.
That bomb was near your house.
Is everybody OK?
.
You, not answering, worries me.
I have to talk to you.
I told my sister.
I "came out", as you guys say.
Call me as soon as you hear this.
No matter what time.
My phone is on.
Bye, "Hubi".
That's "My Love" in Arabic.
Nice of you to fix it like the café.
Don't talk, eat.
Tell me...
-Not with your mouth full.
Seriously.
How come you and I never got together?
.
What?
.
You heard me.
What didn't you understand?
.
Isn't it obvious?
.
-No.
The moment I met you I knew you'd be the best guy I'd ever know.
I decided not to ruin it with a one night stand or a short affair.
You and me, it's forever.
Soul mates till we die.
Well, I guess I won't be dying this time.
But good answer, very good answer.
You always knew how to say the right thing at the right time.
Good morning.
-Good morning.
A wonderful morning.
A wonderful morning to the newlyweds.
Tank you.
-I hope you are happy.
I am.
You looked gorgeous last night, like a bride on TV.
Thanks.
I was so nervous yesterday, I didn't pay attention to anyone.
I couldn't even sleep.
A bride doesn't sleep on her wedding night!
You'll have time for sleep later...
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Hold your fire!
Come on, let's get 'em!
Don't be scared, my love.
Don't be scared.
Rana, talk to me!
I was going to bring it to you in bed.
You make coffee as well?
.
Nice.
Don't you want coffee?
.
Never mind, I'm a bit screwed up.
When someone's nice to me, I think something must be wrong.
Hi, Mom, what's up?
.
What happened?
.
There'll be orphans in every house!
.
In every street!
Are you sure?
.
OK Mom, I'll call you later.
Noam!
Violent rioting has struck Nablus.
The entire city has been put under curfew.
Disturbances began at the funeral of Rana Sirtawi, daughter to one of the cities respected families.
She was accidentally killed during military activity.
Official sources say it was during pursuit of terrorists associated with the bombing at Café Bialik last night...
I can't believe it.
Sirtawi was accidentally caught in the line of fire and hurt.
Hamas officials say they will avenge the killing of Sirtawi, who recently married a local Hamas leader.
Ashraf, answer me.
Call me, please call me.
I'm sorry I couldn't answer before.
Yali was hurt in the bombing.
I was at the hospital.
I wanted to call you sooner.
Now I just saw on TV...
I hope...
Call me.
May you know no more sorrow.
Allah will revenge her.
We'll kill a hundred, a thousand of them.
They have to be taught a lesson.
So they'll go away from here.
May you know no more sorrow.
T.ill they all leave.
All the Jews.
Father...
Do you want something to drink?
.
Something to eat?
.
My friend, hear me well...
Your daughter is a martyr.
We will avenge her death.
Good thing she didn't see this before she died.
I won't threaten you.
Don't be scared.
Samira is beautiful and she loves you.
Get married and make your father happy with a grandchild.
It's time for me to go.
A bit more.
-Is this good?
.
A little more.
That's it.
Can you see Rana?
.
-Yes.
Begin.
Are you sure you want to carry out this mission yourself?
.
Yes.
Begin.
I, the living martyr, Jihad Nasser El-Din, son of Izz a-Din al-Qassam...
What are you doing here?
.
I came to take your place.
What do you think he'd like today?
.
Tomato soup.
Two portions, one for Lulu...
And panacotta.
That's his favorite.
Some coffee while you wait?
.
A double, thanks.
How is he?
.
-Alright.
But he doesn't know he won't walk again.
We're afraid.
The doctors say we can wait to tell him.
That's tough.
Ashraf?
.
What happened?
.
I had this weird sensation.
Like an electric shock.
Something's wrong.
Everything's fine, silly.
Panacotta is on the way.
You'll eat to your heart's content.
Sources at the site say a bigger tragedy was avoided when the suicide bomber suddenly turned around and blew himself up in the middle of the empty street.
Hubi, my love...
Let's fly away.
Maybe beyond the smoke and the fighting, there's a better place.
Maybe there really is a paradise where we can just love each other.
I don't know...
I wonder if we ever really had a chance?
.
If, even for a moment, we had a chance...
Lulu and Yali will probably give the papers a photo of the two of us.
Maybe the one from the rave, where we look all high and happy.
Maybe people will see how beautiful we look, and understand how stupid these wars are.
No, they probably never will.
This is a restricted area.
No filming here.
Show me an order, please.
It's enough that I say so.
-No, it isn't.
I said stop filming!
Hey, watch it.
Hands off, please.
Sir, sir!
A bus.
Make them stop, then come to the bus.
Stay alert.
You're pissing me off.
Whatever.
Come on, everybody off.
Quickly, we don't have all day.
Everybody get in two lines.
All the men, pull your shirts up slowly.
You can't film here.
-Really?
Says who?
It's not up to me, you heard the officer.
I'm sorry, you can't just censor us like this.
Whatever. I don't care.
Next.
Good.
Next.
I said slowly, so I can see.
Next.
You with the belly, show me what you have there.
I don't understand.
What does he want?
Let him see your belly.
Don't you understand?
Do as he says.
Good.
-Fuck them.
Stay calm, Jihad.
Now take out your id's and move on.
Help us, please!
Her water broke, she needs help.
Please.
Call an ambulance!
Tell her I'm a medic, I can help.
He's like a doctor.
Don't be scared.
Send an ambulance.
There's a woman in labor here.
She can't breathe!
Relax.
-Where's the ambulance?
The ambulance is coming.
Don't be afraid.
Reassure her.
-l did.
She's giving birth!
Ask her where it hurts.
Where does it hurt?
The pain is terrible!
What is he doing?
Where is the doctor?
Stop it, you're scaring her.
How long for the ambulance?
The doctor's here.
What's going on?
-She's in labor.
Hello, I'm the doctor.
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.
The baby's coming legs first.
Push, push, help me!
Push.
Push!
-Help me.
Harder.
Harder.
One more push and he's out.
-One more, one more.
He's out!
Something is wrong.
Where is my son?
She wants the baby.
-Give him CPR.
Pulse?
-No.
OK, starting CPR.
I'm sorry.
He has no pulse.
Where is my son?
There is nothing we can do.
You killed that baby!
You killed him!
Have you no shame?
Enough of that, Jihad.
-Stay out of it.
Don't you even care?
Everybody back in line.
Nothing happened here.
Back in line.
Get your ids ready, come on.

A film by Eytan Fox
The Bubble
"The Third Ear"
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
Do you have the new Britney compilation?
Who's that?
It's called "My Prerogative".
And the DVD too.
What's a "Prerogative"?
It's her new video.
She's got blond hair.
Don't know it.
How about the new Rolling Stones set?
Open your ears a bit.
Yeah, right.
Let's get out of here.
Bad time there?
Yes?
I like the atmosphere here.
No uniforms, chilled-out waiters, I think I'll fit in perfect.
I've been here a few times.
Sometimes it takes half an hour to get a table, but it's worth it.
The sweet potato pancakes and the rice pilaf!
I know the owners are girls, so all the waiters are boys...
But that's so over.
Why pass on a girl like me?
I ran a bar in Netanya, but I don't mind starting from the bottom.
In two months I'll be running the place.
But I run the place.
-We'll run it together.
No problem.
Or I can open a branch at the Azrieli Mall.
I was there yesterday.
They don't have one.
We're not a franchise.
There's only this branch.
So think big!
Golan is here now!
The last one wasn't bad.
That small-town boy?
You can't be serious.
He's so not our type.
Maybe it's time to change our type.
Don't all our waiters look like brothers?
That's a thought.
Yali, if you like him, then date him.
But don't lecture us, OK?
What's up?
-Our soldier's back.
It's him?
-Yeah.
I need a few minutes.
-Take your time. I'm here.
So, what's new here?
What about your new guy?
-What about him?
No progress.
I haven't even seen him yet.
Why should it progress?
Has the world progressed?
It actually has.
-No, it hasn't.
All guys want the morning after is to run.
They don't want any baggage or commitment.
The only way to avoid that is to take it slow.
So when the male instinct whispers:
"Run, she's clinging!"
He'll remember those walks on the beach and the movies we saw, and maybe he'll reconsider and stick around.
How long have you been holding out?
-Three weeks.
Isn't three weeks taking it a bit too slow?
I don't know why Sharon has this effect on you,
Miss "Israeli Carrie Bradshaw".
But if you want to keep him, it's time to give it up.
Really?
And the guys on your reserve duty?
Nothing to tell.
-No one?
No sexy suicide bombers?
Don't start.
I won't go back, I swear.
Hi, Sharon...
Busy?
An editorial meeting?
Nothing special.
Why don't you come over tonight?
Yes, my place.
You've been wanting to, right?
Maybe we could rent a DVD.
No, I don't really feel like going out.
Why?
Oh, my roommates?
Going to Sinai.
They're going to Sinai.
israeli Pop idol
I can't believe you're watching that crap.
Don't exaggerate.
We're not really going.
Call my mother, tell her you like the food.
She brought it just for you.
You look great!
Time to go!
-ln a second.
-You can't stay.
Just to see Mr. Editor.
Noam is dying to.
No.
I found your id.
I thought you might need it.
I didn't notice, thank you.
Come in.
My roommates,
Yali, Lulu.
This is... I'm Ashraf.
Ashraf was with me on duty.
I mean, that's where we met.
What's up?
is this a bad time?
We're just the roommates.
I'm Yali.
This is Noam.
And that's Ashraf.
Ashraf?
Nice to meet you all.
Weren't you in a hurry, boys?
You might miss your bus.
Yali, we're going for cash first.
Meet us by the Eilat platform.
I'll just be a second...
I forgot my snorkel.
Tel Aviv, Ashraf.
Ashraf, Tel Aviv.
The sea is over there, but you can't see it.
The European idiots who built the city in the 1 920s didn't know much about the Mediterranean.
They put its back to the sea.
Streets run parallel to the sea and block the breeze.
Then the tall hotels blocked everything.
That's why there's no air.
Are you sweating?
I'm sweating.
I'm really sweating.
Maybe Yali packed those towels he stole from the gym.
So that's how Jews kiss.
Don't you like it?
Sure I do.
But I thought we could...
Take it farther?
Yeah, take it farther.
Golan?
Great shirt.
Yes, I know.
So many fags.
-Problem?
I hate them.
I'm gay. I'm not a girl.
We're all free.
They like being feminine.
Are you joking?
Who wants to be a biter?
A biter?
Pillow biter...
Never heard that?
So you're a fudge packer?
Just joking.
Don't be so touchy.
So naive.
What are these?
-l designed them.
They're nice.
-Just T-shirts for my friends.
But I'm actually serious about fashion design.
I'm thinking of studying in New York next year.
New York is the best.
-So I've heard.
Maybe I'll go to Paris.
Albert Elbaz started in NY, got famous, and then moved to Paris to become the designer for Lanvin.
But he's some kind of genius, isn't he?
And you think I'm not?
Of course you are.
I'm sure you can make it.
There are so many talented people in Tel Aviv.
All you need is to get out into the world, and make a name for yourself.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
So why do you look scared?
What are you afraid of?
-You, kind of.
You're scared of me?
Never mind, forget it.
Forget it?
Forget it.
So, that's how Arabs do it.
Don't you like it?
Sure I do.
I just thought maybe we could take it farther.
It was awful.
Us?
Didn't you...
Not us.
That woman at the checkpoint.
Lots of stories like that.
Jihad, the guy near me at the checkpoint...
He's engaged to my sister.
His father had a heart attack.
His ambulance was stopped at checkpoint.
They searched it.
They held it for an hour.
He died at the hospital entrance.
If they hadn't stopped him...
You know why they have checkpoints?
They weren't always there.
Don't start your propaganda.
Forget politics.
You thought I said we were awful?
-Maybe.
We were explosive!
Explosive?
Don't you know that word?
I know it.
When you explode something, like a bomb.
It can mean cool, too.
Explosive, explosion, explode.
Good sex is explosive.
Explosive.
No Sharon for breakfast?
-He went spinning before work.
Morning spinning.
What a catch!
Delicious!
People forget how sexy a simple sliced tomato can taste.
My battery's out.
Can I use your phone?
Sure.
Thanks.
is he staying?
Where can he go?
He has no permit.
If he's caught, they'll arrest him and send him back.
Are we going to keep him in the closet?
Stop it.
Being gay isn't easy over there.
I don't want to stay.
I won't marry Jihad's cousin.
Why are they pushing me?
Take it easy.
Where are you now?
In Jerusalem, at a friend's house.
They'll kill me if they find out.
What?
Who will kill you?
Are you mad?
Who is she anyway?
Do I know her?
She's a Christian... and a divorcee.
Does she have kids?
Kids?
No, no.
So how are you doing?
I miss you.
I miss you too.
Don't worry, we'll see each other soon.
I took my last exam today.
I'm leaving Jordan in a few days.
Are you sure about him?
He's become so extreme.
He could cause trouble for us.
Listen, he's the man I love.
Jihad is a sensible guy.
He promised to stop soon.
After the wedding, we'll be far from all that, here in Jordan.
What are you doing?
I'm reminding you:
"The roommates agree to uphold a strict guest policy.
"A hook-up lasting more than one week...
"Hoping there wouldn't be such a case...
"This would require the approval of all roommates.
"Maximum stay is two weeks.
"1 4 nights, then he must go."
Yali, all we ever do is talk.
How many times did we promise my mom we'd go to Checkpoint-Watch?
This is a chance to do something important.
is this a political affair?
Stop it!
We can help someone.
OK!
I won't be accused of killing the Israeli left.
I surrender!
Good.
What do you think awaits a gay suicide bomber in heaven?
Seventy virgin twinks or seventy muscle hunks?
Think he can choose?
Golan, I'm really sorry,
Orna owes this guy a favor.
I know what I said yesterday.
I'm really sorry.
Someone leaves every month.
You're next on the list.
No, I just said hi to the security guard.
"Orna Ella"
Another date?
Let's talk later.
Do you have the Pop Idol CD?
Of course.
How could we not?
There, on the right.
See what 24 hours on Sheinkin St can do?
You're a new man!
Probably got some last night...
Does it show?
-Good for you, man.
Can I help you?
-Not right now, thanks.
Hey, what's up?
Still in the editorial meeting?
OK, later.
No problem.
This color is so Arabic.
Smells Arabic too.
Excuse me, what's in this soap?
Don't you like it?
Sorry, I don't.
Our policy is only great-smelling soaps.
Customers aren't allowed to criticize our soaps.
I don't like your tone.
That soap smells better than you do.
How dare you!
Who do you think you are?
I apologize.
She didn't mean it.
Let's get out of here.
I need some fresh air.
-Take your time, chill.
Hey sweetie!
Hi.
Chiki's in the house, wipe off the sour face.
I have to get out of there.
I'm wasting time.
That job isn't forever.
Never mind.
The bastard is screening my calls!
-What?
Nothing, forget it.
Look at the cool stickers we made.
Can I stick one here?
-No, crazy!
Outside, or they'll think I did it.
"Rave Against the Occupation"
Cool, it's better with the sleeves rolled up.
Are you sure?
Do these colors work?
He has to dress right to work at the cafe.
Orna and Ella don't know the truth.
He needs a belt.
He also needs a new name and a whole new biography.
Wow, this belt looks great.
Don't move.
I always had fantasies about George Michael.
I had fantasies about the entire wall.
You liked George Michael?
Who did you fantasize about at 1 5?
River Phoenix, Morrissey,
Chris Lowe from the Pet Shop Boys...
There were a lot.
Him and that sad little indie world of those suffering singers!
Jerk!
You love what I play.
And the minute you leave he puts on "Take That".
Jason Orange!
Jason Orange, the sweet hard-ons of high school.
Jason, the sweet dancer, I was so in love with him.
When they broke up I wanted to go to London and find him.
Wait a minute, who did you like in "Take That"?
Robbie, of course.
And you?
You're such an awful snob!
Actually we're missing a picture of Michel Foucault, to replace Stephen from Boyzone.
-Shut up.
What's wrong?
A little culture, some tradition...
We're all one people that way, at least.
I can't wear that.
That's much better.
My clothes work best on him.
But there's not much to choose from.
Ashraf, follow me.
My dear, I sense your mood is not fabulous, but I can make it better.
Allow me to interest you in my new script.
It's a fascinating story.
-l'd be delighted.
I know you are writing the part just for me.
No other actress in town could play such a role.
Waiter!
One second.
Stick close to me, and repeat everything I say.
Good evening.
No, no...
That's exactly what we don't do.
Be casual.
Thank you very much, you're sweet.
What's your name?
Oh, what should we call him?
He needs a Hebrew name.
I worked for an Israeli contractor.
He gave us all Hebrew names.
He called me Shimi.
Shimi, like Shimon, right?
Or short for Samson.
"Let my soul die with the Philistines".
History's first suicide bomber.
Stop it.
Why not?
I am Shimi.
Want some Kebab, Hummus, Tehina?
How come you don't have an accent?
No broblem, if you want I bring it right back.
I take your bicture?
We no habe work, no habe money, we just want the beace, really.
I didn't mean that, you know.
It's OK. lt's really unusual.
When I was young I worked at my uncle's souvenir shop in Jerusalem.
We had Jewish customers, so I learned.
I thought it might be useful.
My uncle used to joke: "this one talks like a Jew, that's no good".
You must try our famous sweet potato pancakes.
Here are the shirts.
Alright people, let's sit down.
We have a lot to discuss.
Be careful with the chairs.
I promised we'd leave this place in good shape.
The slave labor arrives at 5 AM to clean up anyway.
Don't start arguing.
Yes, let's save the arguments for another time.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Plan.
We leave Tel Aviv in a convoy of cars.
We'll drive up toward Tel-Baruch Beach.
And make our way to the rave location!
Question.
What about the police?
-l don't think we'll have any trouble.
The police only look for raves in the desert.
They came last time, they could come again.
If they show up this time, we must fight back.
-Fight back!
Hold on.
Now my idea for the poster.
"Rave Against the Occupation"
I want everybody naked, wearing only fig leaves.
I used the colors of the Palestinian and Israeli flags.
Maybe we can do without those colors, to draw a bigger crowd.
We could always use the flags of Denmark and Sweden.
They're pretty and they don't piss anybody off.
Don't be so cynical.
All I'm saying is, the poster doesn't need the old politics.
It can be more subtle:
we're young and against war.
Where?
In New Zealand?
Maybe we should invite some Palestinians.
We never have any.
We haven't succeeded.
Anyone know any young Palestinians who can come to our meetings?
Yeah, right.
This is bullshit!
How could they come?
They can't get permits!
You're all so disconnected!
You're living in denial.
Go to the checkpoints!
Ever been to the West Bank?
And you?
I just spent a month on reserve duty at a checkpoint.
You didn't refuse?
Hey, we're here for the poster.
Talk politics later.
Bye, Lulu.
Want one?
There are lots left.
The shirts are great.
You're really talented.
Thanks.
So where are you going now?
For a drink with the boys.
OK, so I'll see you.
Cool place, right?
Golan's coming.
Don't mention Shimi works at the cafe.
He'll kill me.
What's this?
It's a new production of "Bent." -"Bent?"
Yeah, it's a famous play.
A love story about two men in a concentration camp.
It's with Lior Ashkenazi.
Yummy!
We've got to go!
Do you like theater?
I do.
But I've never seen a play in Hebrew.
What's up, bro?
Meet my friends, Lulu, Noam.
I told you about them.
And this is Shimi, Noam's friend.
is your friend Palestinian?
Your shorts look a bit Palestinian.
Sorry about Golan.
He got out of the army two years ago, but he still has the mentality of a Golani trooper.
And proud of it!
Golan, a Golani trooper forever!
Maybe his trooper friends should know what he does at night.
Sister, my friends know exactly what I do.
I came out like a man and they took it like men.
These are my brothers, sweetheart.
We busted our asses together, fought terrorists in the Hebron Casbah.
Believe me... ln the trenches, any minute some dog might shoot you from behind...
You learn it doesn't matter.
As long as he's protecting you, who cares if he's straight or gay?
I need a drink.
Anyone coming along?
No, we'll stay.
We hate Arabs too.
Did I say something wrong?
Your friends don't like army talk?
What can I get you?
I'm leaving.
-What happened?
"1 4-Year-Old Boy Killed in Jenin by Occupation Forces"
What are you doing?
Just reading news from home.
What's going on there?
-The usual stuff.
Come on, pound me!
Pound me?
Pound me!
Problem?
I don't know...
-Consummate sound better?
Sexual intercourse?
Then just nail me from behind!
You're so drunk.
It's not from the wine!
Not in the hallway, bro.
Who's that woman?
My mother.
Where does she live?
She doesn't.
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
-lt's OK.
We used to live in Jerusalem.
Fuck me!
Fuck me!
I want to be your whore.
Yes!
Yes, Mama!
Yes!
Fuck me.
Yes, Mama!
Yes!
Fuck me, Mama, fuck me!
Mama...
Fuck me.
-l want to be your whore.
Perverts.
Mama!
Mama!
I'll ask his army friends to pound you.
Bring them on, I'm getting hot.
Please.
Good morning Sheinkin Street!
We would like to invite you to the best party in town.
A rave against the occupation.
A rave for peace.
You are all welcome to come to the rave on October 23.
We don't need the territories, we need to dance!
Rave against the occupation!
A party for peace!
We all want peace, right?
We all want the same thing.
Dance!
Dance!
Dance!
A rave for peace, let's all show up.
Let's dance instead of shoot!
Let's all show up.
Don't you ever learn?
Don't you ever change?
The new generation wants peace.
-What do you know?
Ever had an 8-year-old's leg fall on your face after a bombing?
Make them stop pushing me.
They're hitting me.
They're crazy.
Animals!
I could punch them!
Morons.
Are you OK?
-Better now.
I'm on the verge of losing it.
What are you talking about?
-l'm sick of everything.
"Time Out Tel Aviv"
Come on.
Lulu?
!
What's up with her?
Lulu.
Where's Sharon?
-End of the hall, to the right.
is he expecting you?
-He should be.
Hey, how are you?
Fuck you.
That's how I am.
What kind of talk is that?
Fuck you, loser.
Who do you think you are?
Take it easy.
Shut up.
You think you're "50 Cent" and I'm your bitch?
Why did you chase me for a month?
Just to get laid, run off and avoid my calls?
What kind of behavior is that?
I came here to tell you about a porn site.
It's for the world's smallest dicks.
They'll pay a fortune for yours.
Let's go.
They call it the "bubble", because nothing here is real.
Look around.
These people have no connection to reality.
Kibbutz life is a bubble, too.
West Bank settlements are bubbles.
Who can say anymore what's real and what's a bubble?
Maybe...
You're new here?
-Yes.
So this is for you.
-Thank you.
What's your name?
-Shimi.
Shimi.
A pretty name for a pretty boy.
Everything cool?
-Look at the tip I got.
She pulls that trick on every new waiter.
Once she finds out you're gay, she'll go back to being cheap.
Someone's here for you.
Hello.
-Hey.
You're new here?
That lady just pulled that on me.
At least she left me a nice tip.
Tips are nice.
But I've got something better.
Tonight, after the photo shoot for Lulu's poster, I'm taking you to the theater.
Listen, do you...
What?
Miss it?
What?
You know.
Yes.
-We don't have to.
What?
Miss it.
We're here together.
We don't have to miss it.
We can't look at each other.
We can't touch.
We can feel...
-Feel what?
Each other.
Without looking.
Without touching.
I can feel you right now.
Next to me.
Can you feel me?
Maybe.
Don't worry.
He won't hear us.
Feel me.
No.
-l'm touching you.
It's burning.
-l'm kissing you.
Burning
-Kissing your lips.
Hot.
-Kissing your eyes.
Yes.
-Inside your mouth.
Yes.
-Neck.
Yes.
-Down.
Yes.
-Down.
Yes.
-Do you feel my mouth?
Do you feel my cock?
-Yes.
Do you know what I am doing?
-Yes.
Can you taste what I am doing?
-Yes.
Together.
-Together.
Do you feel me?
-l want you inside me.
Feel.
-l have you inside me.
Inside.
-Strong.
I'm going to...
-Strong.
Do you feel...
I'm going to...
-Strong.
Strong.
-Yes.
Strong.
-Yes.
Oh, my God!
Oh...
Did you?
Yes.
You?
-Yes.
You're a good lay.
-So are you.
Max?
-What?
We did it.
How about that.
Fucking guards, fucking camp, we did it.
We were real.
We made love.
They're not going to kill us.
I like that thing they did, running a finger over their eyebrow, instead of saying "l love you."
Luckily we don't need that.
Maybe in Tel Aviv you don't.
Where are you from in Jerusalem?
-French Hill.
Really?
You know I used to live in lssawiya.
Really?
How come you never told me?
I was very young when we left, I don't remember much.
Maybe we were neighbors.
-Yeah, something like that.
My father was born there, all his family is from Jerusalem.
So you have an Israeli id?
-l used to.
We used to live at my grandparents' house.
When my younger sister was born, it got crowded.
So my father started building us a new house.
He borrowed money, opened his savings account.
Built the house himself, with family and friends.
It was coming along great.
My sister and I used to run around, deciding who would get which room.
And then we got a demolition warrant.
And what happened?
-What happened?
...
One day a tractor came and tore it all down.
My mom stood outside screaming, but nothing helped.
Within an hour, it was gone.
What did you do?
-l was just a kid, what could I do?
I threw rocks at the tractor.
But my father stopped me.
That evening he told us we were moving to a place that was our own.
We left.
Returned our ids and moved to Nablus.
My mother argued with him.
She said Israeli ids would be good to have.
But my father refused.
He couldn't take it.
You scared me.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
I didn't think there was anything to see.
So, how was the play?
Interesting, lots of food for thought.
You should go.
Yeah, as I said pretty clearly at the Breakfast Club, I really want to see it.
Oh...
-Never mind, it's no big deal.
Yali, I'm so sorry, I totally forgot.
Forget it.
Focus on yourself.
You do that so well.
What's that mean?
It means what it means.
-Do you want to talk about it?
I don't have anything to say.
-OK.
I just think that something isn't right.
It's not right that I'm happy?
-Of course you're happy... lf he's not straight, or in a relationship, or a tourist, at least let him be...
Never mind, let's change the subject.
Come on, say it.
How should I put it?
We've always tried to keep away from politics.
We don't go to checkpoints with Lulu's mom.
We try to just live and...
Don't you get it?
Sorry to rain on your parade, but...
He's really sweet and I watch over him at the cafe but...
Somehow it doesn't feel real.
So what do you suggest?
I don't know, Noam.
Just more food for thought.
I'll talk to him about the nudity, it'll be fine.
Don't you trust me?
Leave it to me.
OK, he's here.
Bye.
What's up?
-How are you?
There you go.
-For me, a double espresso, thanks.
I'll have a Corona.
No problem.
So, what is this about?
Alright.
As I told you, it's our Spring Special.
Every celebrity we choose gets a two-page spread, and recommends the hottest things of the hour.
And you get the cover.
-Who's in it?
Artists.
Celebs.
People of the hour.
You, with your new play, "Bent."
Camilla, the winner from "Big Brother".
Mali Levi, with her new jeans campaign, you know.
What concept did you have in mind?
-lt'll be a huge production.
You, in the center, naked.
Around you, fifteen naked girls...
Did you even see the play?
-Of course I did.
Quality stuff.
But hey.
The play is one thing and the Spring Special is another.
Face it.
The Holocaust is not sexy.
And my cover has to be sexy.
Yeah, I guess the Holocaust isn't that sexy.
There you go.
-Thanks.
How are you?
-Excuse me?
Don't you remember me?
-Remind me.
You remember, we met at Lulu's apartment, and then at Time Out.
You must remember that.
Maybe you're confusing me with someone else.
Don't be scared.
I wanted to talk to you about doing a story.
"Tel Aviv through the eyes of a Palestinian."
Excuse me a moment.
Yali, I'm sorry, I have to...
Where did he go?
I hope I didn't scare him.
What did you say to him?
Just that I want to do a story about him.
A story about him?
You got any more Palestinians working here?
We could do a group piece.
-What?
They're all legal, right?
-What do you mean?
He's gone.
OK...
Maybe we'll talk about it some other time.
Why didn't you tell us, silly?
Open the window,
My darling one
Let the wind blow in Mix the outside with the inside...
My God, it stinks in here.
You need air.
Your crotch smell is all over town.
The neighbors are asking if there's a corpse in here.
Look, sweetie, hop into the shower.
Take a walk, then go back to bed.
Diet-wise, it's great.
Like a double Yom Kippur.
Cleans the blood wonderfully.
I'll give you some onion pills to totally clean your system.
It's your mom.
Yes, mom.
I turned mine off for a sec.
No, Ashraf isn't here.
He went back to Nablus, why?
Today in NabIus Air Force Apache helicopters fired missiles at a car driven by RiyaI Bek,
leader of the military arm of Hamas.
Security officials claim that Bek was part of an attempt to launch local cells of AI-Qaeda.
Hamas vowed to avenge...
No answer.
I keep sending him messages.
I don't know what to do.
What do we do about him?
Tell me...
Do you think I can pass for a TV reporter going to the territories?
Someone like Christiane Amanpour?
Have you gone crazy too?
I have an idea.
I have a great idea.
"Rave against the occupation"
Shaul.
Shaul.
I wanted to bring you one, but I thought it would be cooler if you saw them already up.
They look good.
-Good?
They looks great.
Thanks to you.
You're the best.
Thanks.
Listen, I would love to stay and help, but I have to run.
Anything happen?
Actually, a lot's happened.
I'll tell you some other time.
Promise?
-Promise.
Sharon?
The trouble girl is on her way to your office.
It's OK, she's here.
I'll take care of it.
What do you want?
Don't make me call the police.
Chill, you have a chance to help me and get a cease-fire.
Help you with what?
-l need press cards.
Press cards?
-Yes, temporary cards.
Like the ones you got us for the rock gig.
You can cut out these pictures.
We need to get through checkpoints.
We're going to Nablus.
-Nablus?
Yes.
To do a story.
About what?
About how Palestinian men act the morning after.
Don't start that again.
Yali did a great job with the car.
I'm telling you, he could be an art director in movies.
He said to put this up in front.
-He put a lot of work into this.
But he bailed out on the trip.
It's impossible to get him out of Tel-Aviv.
We should switch to English.
We can't use Hebrew there.
Sounds bad.
They'll know immediately you're Israeli.
Do a French accent.
No one will know.
You're crazy, I can't talk like that.
There's the checkpoint.
I hope no one recognizes me.
Next in line.
Move on.
Put down the suitcase.
Open the suitcase.
Take it out.
Give it to me.
Sorry.
What's that?
It's Henna, for the wedding.
Give it to me.
Let me see.
You sure it's Henna?
Henna.
Check if it's Henna.
It is.
-You can pack.
Close the door.
What are you doing here?
You want them to kill me?
I was worried about you.
I'm sorry, I wanted to call back.
You don't know what it's like here.
I'm sorry.
You're really crazy.
Jihad!
Wait.
You can't tell anyone.
I never thought you were one of those.
Promise me you won't tell!
I won't ruin the most beautiful week of your sister's life.
Did you invite them?
No.
They'll leave.
-Now!
Make them leave!
-Promise me.
Till the wedding.
After that, only Allah knows.
My cousin Samira will be at the wedding.
You must marry her.
If you do, maybe I won't say anything.
Why do this?
-lt's that way.
Welcome.
I missed you.
Welcome.
Are you OK?
Are you sure?
I was so scared.
Let me speak to him.
Don't you see he's a wreck?
You must come to the rave.
Know where it is?
He misses you terribly.
She's right. I really do.
Why didn't you invite Golan?
He doesn't fit in.
-Why not?
But I'll find someone.
Plenty to choose from.
What a relief.
And you, Mr. Depression?
-What about me?
Have some MDMA.
What for?
For fun, dummy.
You did it!
-What do you mean?
Fashionably late Comrade Ashraf.
What an entrance.
You're getting bitchy!
I'm only kidding.
Aren't jokes allowed anymore?
I'm so happy you came.
-l didn't think I would make it.
The checkpoints took hours, then getting into Israel, hitchhiking through the mountains, and then... you don't need the details.
I'm really happy you're here.
Hey, what are you doing here?
is this a private party?
Got a strict door policy?
No, I'm glad you came but...
Because it's a rave?
I'm into causes, too.
I'm totally left-wing, bro.
See you.
I saved us some.
I thought you might come.
I'm so happy you came.
Open wide.
Say ah!
You're such a sucker.
That's the first trick in Golan's book.
I dance with someone else...
You get jealous and come crawling.
What do you want?
Stop being so heavy.
Dance with me, man!
Did it kick in?
What?
Yeah, I guess it did.
Go get her...
She's not waiting for me.
You know, I love you.
-Really?
Really.
And I want us to make love.
And then get married, and have lots of children.
Are you rolling on X?
No, it's real.
It's not because I'm high.
I really feel it.
OK.
I'll decide later if I join you or let you do it alone.
Remember the playground between French Hill and lssawiya?
Yeah, the Jews' playground.
We never went there.
At first, all the kids played there, until we were about 6 years old.
Maybe we even played there together.
I don't think so, I would have spotted you.
I'm joking.
My father was our neighborhood committee president.
There were complaints about Arab kids scaring the other kids.
So he got an order preventing the lssawiya kids from playing there.
My mother had a terrible fight with him.
She invited all the mothers and kids from lssawiya to come to a reconciliation party at the playground.
My father laughed at her "attempt at World Peace."
He said no one would come.
And on the day of the party, no one did.
Not even the Israeli mothers.
Later we found out they were scared off.
We sat there drinking juice and eating cake.
She pushed me high on the swings.
Back home, my father and brother were watching soccer on TV.
Later, in the bath, I noticed my Mom had tears in her eyes.
She was trying to wipe them away, so I pretended I didn't see them.
I know it sounds crazy, but I think that was the day the illness began in her body.
Somehow, I'm sure of that.
I just love the city on Saturday mornings.
Tel Aviv has such beautiful moments.
Yeah, like now, when everything is quiet and calm.
I really love Tel Aviv.
It's a shame it's surrounded by such crap.
If we could only make all the politics disappear.
Why didn't you invite Shaul?
-What for?
We saw you two.
It seemed so nice and romantic.
And what about Golan?
Don't change the subject, we're talking about Shaul.
He was high on X.
-High on you!
What's the matter?
He's sexy.
-He was wasted.
"l swear it's not because I'm rolling.
"l'm in love with you, you're beautiful and I really wanna fuck you.
"ls anal an option?"
Can you really play?
-Sure.
I wanted to be a rock star.
Really?
In high school, we even had a band, "The Sirens."
We used to cover classics.
Do you know Tim Buckley?
No.
During the army I quit music and never really came back to it.
And now it's too late.
It's not too late.
We're still young.
You can do anything you want.
At my age?
-"At my age?"
Very funny.
Come on, sing something.
I want to hear you sing.
Come on.
-Really?
Yeah?
This is a song my mother loved, she always wanted me to play it for her.
You don't have to.
I want to.
Wait a second.
What was her name?
-Whose name?
Your mother's.
Sarah.
Her name was Sarah.
I wanted to say "my love" in Arabic, but you never taught me how.
Anyway, I'm off to work.
Have a nice trip back.
Have fun at the wedding.
And say "MazaI Tov" to your sister.
Maybe you shouldn't say it's from me.
But come back to me soon.
Very soon.
How did you sleep?
-Like a rock.
You?
Me too.
Excuse me, is this lemon or lemongrass?
I can't really tell from here but it says on the label.
What's up?
Remember what I told you last night?
I was totally wasted, I don't remember much.
I said I wanted us to get married, have kids.
You said I was just high.
Don't you remember?
Sort of.
Well, it's true.
I want us to be together.
What?
Right now?
From this very second?
Yes.
OK.
But do we really have to get married?
I'm not up for the whole religious thing.
No way.
You're the boss.
It's OK.
Your not bothering me, I'm just smelling soap.
Stop, not here.
I'm going to "Erez" for bread.
I'll come back later.
Go on, it's very sweet.
Alright.
Come on.
Put down the bags.
Come on.
Come on.
Open the bags so the soldier can see what's in there.
Come on, let's see.
Have your ids ready.
Excuse me, soldier, these people are guests coming to my sister's wedding.
Maybe you could please...
-What are they to you?
They're guests for my sister's wedding.
Where are you from?
Nablus.
Hello, Ashraf.
Welcome.
Sorry for the delay.
Don't worry, they'll let you through in a minute.
You'll be on time, God willing.
What does he want?
I don't know.
Ashraf Sirtawi from Nablus.
Stay out of this.
Get in line with the others.
-Hey, I was just explaining...
You understand Hebrew, right?
Get in line before I have you detained.
They're my sister's guests...
Stand aside!
Am I clear?
How are you, gorgeous?
Thank God you're here!
What's up?
Jihad hasn't arrived yet.
Stop worrying.
He'll be here soon.
Jihad's mother was here and she started talking about naming our baby after Jihad's father.
What baby?
I have so much to do before that.
I need to find work, finish my studies, make sure we have everything...
Then we'll see.
Forget it, it's just talk.
You just think about the wedding.
You think so?
-Yes.
What's happening with you?
You've become fashionable.
-Don't like it?
-lt's very nice.
Where are the clothes from?
From her?
Who is she?
I don't care if she's divorced, tell me!
Remember the news team that was here when you arrived?
That beautiful French girl?
You're my sister, eventually you'll have to know.
Don't make it sound like a Jordanian soap opera!
is that French girl Jewish?
Not an Israeli!
-No, it's not her...
The guy that was with her.
Noam, from Tel Aviv.
What about him?
He's very nice, really.
I don't understand.
What about him?
No, you do understand.
I love him and... I don't understand and neither do you!
You're just confused.
Where did you get these ideas?
First she's French, then a Christian divorcee, and now it's a guy?
Where does this nonsense come from?
It's those American movies you watch.
Why are you like this?
-Me?
Why are you like this?
Have you gone mad?
This conversation is over.
I have to do my makeup.
We'll talk later.
Please, if you love me, you must understand me.
No, you understand me!
That's enough.
We'll talk after the wedding.
Surprising choice... think it will work?
I get goose bumps when I sing it...
Who was that?
-Golan. I'm not in the mood.
Why are you so mean to him?
He was so sweet at the rave, I saw everything.
I'm not into him.
-Does he know?
No.
-So tell him.
He'll figure it out.
-Why be an asshole?
Can't you tell him?
He won't cut his wrists.
Men are such stupid animals.
Please, no Judith Butler now.
It's the semi-finals!
No lectures.
-l can't understand why men, after all the revolutions, are still so emotionally crippled.
And you gays are the worst.
Call him now.
Meet him, and tell him.
Now!
OK.
Hey, sweetie.
Just getting ready for the "Pop Idol" semi-finals.
Never mind.
You feel like having coffee?
No, not at "Orna and Ella", let's go to Cafe Bialik.
Eight o'clock?
OK.
Bye.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
What's happening?
-Everything's according to plan.
Go up to Samira.
She's waiting.
Go to her.
Hello.
-Hi.
How are you?
-Good.
And you?
The truth?
So so.
Uptight about your sister's wedding?
Yes, a little.
What are you doing these days?
I'm studying here, in college.
You know how it is here, the level isn't too high.
I want to study architecture abroad.
-Really?
I want to go to London, I've got relatives there.
London.
Not bad.
They've got great music.
They have it all.
Maybe you should come too.
You'll be better off there.
Things will never get better here.
And you'll escape Jihad and his stupid friends.
I want to go dance a little.
I'll be back later.
OK.
Congratulations, Ashraf.
Dance, dance.
Yes...
Dropped him off in Tel Aviv?
I can't hear.
You're breaking up.
Dropped him off in Tel Aviv?
Great.
Great.
May Allah bless you.
I'll wait to hear it on the radio.
Goodbye.
A bomb!
-Are you sure?
And not far away.
I'll see what happened.
Lulu, did you hear?
-Good, it's you.
It was really big.
The whole house shook.
I thought something would break.
Something broke?
No, nothing, I think.
Where's Yali?
He went out for coffee, a date with Golan.
Hold on, I have a call.
Noam, that was Golan.
He was late.
The bomb was at Cafe Bialik.
-What?
You're here!
I mean alive.
You're alive.
We were worried sick.
We thought the worst.
You are OK, right?
-Yes, our sweet Yali is fine.
Don't get emotional on me.
I don't need drama queens.
I've been declared "moderately wounded".
It doesn't even hurt.
I just can't feel my legs.
They say it's the injections.
You'll be fine, I'm sure.
We're Yali's roommates.
I'm Lulu, this is Noam.
Good thing you got here fast.
We were waiting.
We panicked.
When we called the hospital, the line was busy.
I was scared to come directly here.
My mother called a doctor friend.
That's how we knew.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
I realized I forgot my wallet.
I had to go back.
That's why I was late.
Just a little late.
I got there a few seconds after the explosion.
I brought you purple flowers, your favorite color.
is that him?
Answer him.
He must be worried.
It's alright.
I'll talk to him later.
Answer already.
Noam, where are you?
Answer me.
That bomb was near your house.
is everybody OK?
You, not answering, worries me.
I have to talk to you.
I told my sister.
I "came out", as you guys say.
Call me as soon as you hear this.
No matter what time.
My phone is on.
Bye, "Hubi".
That's "My Love" in Arabic.
Nice of you to fix it like the cafe.
Don't talk, eat.
Tell me...
-Not with your mouth full.
Seriously.
How come you and I never got together?
What?
You heard me.
What didn't you understand?
Isn't it obvious?
-No.
The moment I met you I knew you'd be the best guy I'd ever know.
I decided not to ruin it with a one night stand or a short affair.
You and me, it's forever.
Soul mates till we die.
Well, I guess I won't be dying this time.
But good answer, very good answer.
You always knew how to say the right thing at the right time.
Good morning.
-Good morning.
A wonderful morning.
-A wonderful morning to the newlyweds.
Thank you.
-l hope you are happy.
I am.
You looked gorgeous last night, like a bride on TV.
Thanks.
I was so nervous yesterday, I didn't pay attention to anyone.
I couldn't even sleep.
A bride doesn't sleep on her wedding night!
You'll have time for sleep later...
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Hold your fire!
Come on, let's get 'em!
Don't be scared, my love.
Don't be scared.
Rana, talk to me!
Wait a moment.
I was going to bring it to you in bed.
You make coffee as well?
Nice.
Don't you want coffee?
Never mind, I'm a bit screwed up.
When someone's nice to me, I think something must be wrong.
Hi, Mom, what's up?
What happened?
There'll be orphans in every house!
In every street!
Are you sure?
OK Mom, I'll call you later.
Noam!
violent rioting has struck NabIus.
The entire city has been put under curfew.
Disturbances began at the funeral of Rana Sirtawi, daughter to one of the city's respected families.
She was accidentally killed during military activity.
official sources say it was during pursuit of terrorists associated with the bombing at Cafe BiaIik last night... I can't believe it.
Sirtawi was accidentally caught in the line of fire and hurt.
Hamas officials say they will avenge the killing of Sirtawi, who recently married a local Hamas leader.
Ashraf, answer me.
Call me, please call me.
I'm sorry I couldn't answer before.
Yali was hurt in the bombing.
I was at the hospital.
I wanted to call you sooner.
Now I just saw on TV... I hope...
Call me.
May you know no more sorrow.
Allah will revenge her.
We'll kill a hundred, a thousand of them.
They have to be taught a lesson.
So they'll go away from here.
May you know no more sorrow.
Till they all leave.
All the Jews.
Father...
Do you want something to drink?
Something to eat?
My friend, hear me well...
Your daughter is a martyr.
We will avenge her death.
Good thing she didn't see this before she died.
I won't threaten you.
Don't be scared.
Samira is beautiful and she loves you.
Get married and make your father happy with a grandchild.
It's time for me to go.
A bit more.
is this good?
A little more.
That's it.
Can you see Rana?
-Yes.
Begin.
Are you sure you want to carry out this mission yourself?
Yes.
Begin.
I, the living martyr, Jihad Nasser El-Din, son of Izz a-Din al-Qassam...
What are you doing here?
I came to take your place.
What do you think he'd like today?
Tomato soup.
Two portions, one for Lulu...
And panacotta.
That's his favorite.
Some coffee while you wait?
A double, thanks.
How is he?
-Alright.
But he doesn't know he won't walk again.
We're afraid.
The doctors say we can wait to tell him.
That's tough.
Ashraf?
What happened?
I had this weird sensation.
Like an electric shock.
Something's wrong.
Everything's fine, silly.
Panacotta is on the way.
You'll eat to your heart's content.
Sources at the site say a bigger tragedy was avoided when the suicide bomber suddenly turned around and blew himself up in the middle of the empty street.
Hubi, my love...
Let's fly away.
Maybe beyond the smoke and the fighting, there's a better place.
Maybe there really is a paradise where we can just love each other.
I don't know... I wonder if we ever really had a chance?
If, even for a moment, we had a chance...
Lulu and Yali will probably give the papers a photo of the two of us.
Maybe the one from the rave, where we look all high and happy.
Maybe people will see how beautiful we look, and understand how stupid these wars are.
No, they probably never will.

We got paper from the ME.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2006/11/21
Natural causes?
What did you do, a drive-by intake?
He was outdoors three or four weeks, exposed to the elements.
He was hanged.
After his ribs were broken.
How do you miss that?
Did you even look at him?
We should come back.
Yeah, I looked at him.
See?
What does this mean, "WNL.
WNL."
WNL.
I found body disposition and protocols within normal limits.
No.
WNL, we never looked.
I checked with Missing persons.
That's about all you checked.
You're fired.
That may come back to haunt you, Rodgers.
What galls me...
"Skater" Stevens was murdered.
If he wasn't a celeb, nobody would even know.
Yeah.
Celeb?
Do you believe this?
Logan swears he's never heard of him.
Two of us.
Alvin "Skater" stevens?
From the sitcom "goofing around"?
It ran for years.
So, uh, this thing was a junkie?
Had been.
Pretty much clean the last six months.
Before that, living hard.
How bad?
If the dentist hadn't confirmed he was 30,
I'd have put him at 50.
How bad was the beating?
Short but merciless.
Even for a child star, this kid fell far.
Skater's mom is on her way in.
Maybe we can spare her some of the details.
I get the feeling this isn't the first time that Skater's broken her heart.
Enjoy, Rodgers.
Yeah.
Skater, I can't go to the prom with you.
I already made plans.
With who?
Could it be Kirk?
Come on, Karen.
Kirk.
Oh, no, not again!
That was Skater's Skater noise.
Yeah?
I gave it to him.
I said, "honey, to be a star, you have to have a signature, a hook."
Wheeler, Logan, this is Mrs. Stevens.
Skater's mom, Lucinda.
He was such a beautiful boy.
We're sorry for your loss.
I don't understand how "Skater" Stevens ended up in a pauper's grave.
There was no missing persons report.
No, not formally.
Then you weren't in close touch.
The last few years, I told him it was his responsibility to keep up.
Did he?
A postcard in June.
Said he was going back to stand-up, had a job.
Any idea where?
His friends might know.
There's a memorial for him tonight.
They passed the hat, flew me in.
Why did you change your mind?
A week ago, you called the studio and asked them to help find him?
Wonder street films produced "goofing around."
They made a fortune off Skater.
So you just called him out of the blue?
I mean, was there any particular reason?
Well, they just announced "goofing around" as coming out on DVD.
My Skater, he was terrible with money.
Oh.
So you thought if there was a check coming from the DVD, you'd hold onto it.
Those checks, if they even got to Skater, they just slipped through his fingers.
Officer.
Some mother.
She didn't love Skater, just saw her son as a meal ticket.
If anybody had cared about him, he wouldn't have ended up in potter's field.
Least he didn't stay there.
You guys pulled him out.
And even now,
I can't believe that Skater's not gonna come down those stairs and say, come on.
I gave him that.
He played my best pal for five years.
He'll never stop being that.
Thank you.
Oh, no, no.
Thank you, thank you very much.
So Skater's whole career was playing a doormat to Kirk?
More like he worshipped Kirk.
Everybody did.
You had to be there.
Oh, I see.
Hello.
Thank you for coming.
So you must be from TV guide for the interview.
Not quite.
Different interview.
You got a minute?
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were...
Yeah, sure, sure.
Look, we're trying to get a handle on the last few months of Skater's life.
Oh, well, good luck.
I thought you were his best pal.
We both had our childhoods taken from us.
That's a bond.
Kirkster, could you sign this, please?
How about lately?
Well, doing okay.
No acting, but I'm still keeping a hand in the business.
Production side.
We were talking about Skater.
Had you been in touch with him lately?
Long after everyone else gave up on him.
Know where he lived?
Where he worked?
Hand-to-mouth.
I mean, last I saw him, he'd just lost a fast food job.
Slipped him a few 20s.
Told him it was an advance on our residuals.
Oh, there's my interview.
Have you got a recent photo of Skater on that thing?
Oh, sure.
Here you go.
You're kidding.
An ice cream window boy for Sweet Swirl?
On the show, his after-school job, soft serve vendor.
Orange shirt, brown pants.
Say again what your guy wore.
Brown shirt, orange pants.
- Fooled me.
- Fools a lot of people.
Must be 30 trademark infringer operators out there.
These people, they're vultures.
Substandard ice cream treat, inferior melody.
Here's the McCoy.
Catchy.
Can't improve on that.
So no home address 'cause our guy was never your employee.
You don't keep track of these vultures?
We don't.
Unless we get their bills.
Three weeks ago, we got a call from the city impound lot.
They wanted us to pick up one of our trucks.
Thing was, it wasn't our truck.
Three weeks ago.
Do you remember which impound lot it was?
Major case.
Let me get the lock.
It might be tricky.
Looks like a tough one.
Maybe we should call the FBI.
This is a real rathole.
Yeah, but it's Skater's truck, all right.
It's his wall of fame.
It looks like he spent all his time in here.
Smells like it too.
Stale.
Sleep and sweat.
Birdbaths in the sink.
Looks like he was living here.
Could be a stalker.
Look at the way he hides this girl.
That's one photo, Delgado.
One photo he hid.
She might be special to him.
He didn't want his customers seeing her.
Customers?
He wasn't selling ice cream out of this truck.
It's a rusted piece of crap.
He didn't even have a refrigerator in here.
I wonder what he was selling.
Wouldn't be the first time a child star went from using to dealing.
Where'd you say they towed this from?
McCarren park, down by the handball courts.
We have a child sitcom star dealing drugs to children out of an ice cream truck in the park.
Heartwarming.
Do we have anything else?
This girl's picture was in his truck.
So that's a no.
Okay.
Put together a snew team, put the truck back in the park, see who shows up.
A snew team?
Captain, it's a straight buy and bust.
We can handle that.
It's a piece of cake.
Two hours in that truck with that song on.
How you holding out, Wheeler?
Well, it's funny how this whole time only three kids have come up to an ice cream truck.
Well, kids wise up fast.
Oh, there's kid number four.
Copy.
I'll lose him.
Sorry.
We're, um, waiting for ice.
We're closed.
Damn, Wheeler.
That black guy on your right, he just made you.
Okay.
She's closed.
Police!
Put down the weapons!
Let that kid go!
Hey, let him go!
Don't move.
What the hell was that?
Yeah.
Why are we still alive?
Bullets went through both sides of the truck.
Cheap metal.
No.
Nasty guns.
A Czech scorpion, a pray and spray.
And a .9-millimeter
Gyurza and I think a Polish P-64.
So, extrapolating, you'd agree with Logan, you two shouldn't be alive.
These guys were blasters.
Count inside the car, there were four of them.
They used the kid as a shield.
We were outnumbered, outgunned, then all of a sudden they put their guns away
- and split.
- Just like that.
No backup coming, no sirens scaring them off?
Nope.
What do we know about the target?
How does that guy connect to Skater Stevens?
So far we know his name's Chibueze.
He's Nigerian, and he's legal, a licensed peddler, and the bullet just grazed him.
So you all got lucky.
Not lucky.
They let us off the hook.
Our victim won't go in the ambulance.
He's afraid the blasters are gonna take him out at the ER.
Did you offer him an escort?
No sale.
Just wants to go.
The kid, the one who fronted for the Nigerian, where's he?
He took off when the car backed down the road.
I see.
You saved his life, so you thought he'd stay put.
Well, there was a lot going on.
He dropped his lunchbox.
No lunch, but there are some baseball cards and a Harry Potter DVD.
Great.
That should make him easy to trace.
I got a favor to call in.
Do I hold Chibueze?
On what charge?
He let the kid get caught in the crossfire.
So did you.
How much you wanna bet this Chibueze guy doesn't have health insurance?
Let's offer him some free medical.
There you go.
Your construction wound should be fine.
He's all yours.
There he is, Mr. Ace bandage.
Logan.
No more favors.
Rodgers fix you up?
Where is my shirt?
That's in shirt heaven.
I got you a new one.
- Here.
- I have to go to work.
Back out there?
Someone's got it in for you.
Any idea who?
I just wanted ice cream.
So you sent the kid up ahead of you to check out the flavors?
You could have gotten him killed.
He was pleased with the way I paid him.
Whoa.
Hey, Chibueze.
Chibueze, hold on a second.
Listen.
I could book you for endangering that kid, take away your peddler's license.
I don't want to play those games with you.
And what game is this, scare the African?
You're alive.
Your friend Skater, by the time he got here...
They killed Skater?
That's right.
Wanna see the photos?
So who's "they?"
You saw them.
- Not my tribe.
- No.
But two hours after Skater's truck arrived, so did they, and so did you.
What kinda drugs were you and Skater selling out of that truck?
I don't sell drugs.
I sell tube socks and irregular underwear, uptown, Spanish Harlem.
Then what were you doing in Brooklyn?
I thought Skater was back.
But Skater always warned me not to let the girl see me.
What girl is this?
The Albanian girl.
Now I don't use that word again.
This girl, does she have a name?
She wouldn't say her name to me.
Can you describe her?
Cold.
Like this room.
Her picture... he taped it on the wall of his truck.
He kept it covered.
So she was all his.
How much time do you think before I'm back in this room?
I heard you ran into some bad dude Albanians.
This is a good dude Albanian.
Detective Zim Flamur from organized crime control.
Zim says that our shell casings read Albanian mob.
OCC?
You put away that Albanian gang that was making a bid to become the sixth mob family.
Yeah, nice work on that.
See, cops know.
TV, the press.
It's all still Italian mobsters.
They're stuck in the '70s.
And we're stuck in the '80s.
The truck they shot up belonged to a former TV star, "Skater" Stevens.
The "ackackack" guy?
My kids loved him.
Any of these guys look familiar?
This blaster we met.
Ditmir Minojilj.
One son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
In my home country, he shot out a rival gang with an RPG-25.
An antitank weapon?
If he's such a tough guy, why didn't he take out my detectives?
'Cause they're not in blood with him.
If they were, they'd be dead with the Nigerian.
"In blood" like a vendetta?
Older.
From the 15th century Code of Lek.
You're not up on that, Wheeler?
Goren would have known.
An offense to it demands blood.
But it can't be enforced if there's a child, a woman, or a stranger in the picture.
The lunchbox kid, Wheeler, and Logan.
That's why they left.
But yesterday's target, the Nigerian, he's still in blood.
Is he in protective custody?
Wouldn't take it.
Better pick him up before they do.
Yeah.
It's okay.
Well, I guess this is what Ditmir means by "in blood."
No drug stash.
Just disks and recorders.
Skater and Chibueze were counterfeiting DVDs.
Imagine getting killed over a Harry Potter DVD.
Oh, god.
What?
I missed it.
That dvd.
The kid had the same one.
That's not out yet.
That's worth a fortune for about three more weeks.
Then why did the Albanians leave him behind?
There were con ed guys on the street.
They heard Chibueze's screams, called 911.
The killers hit and ran.
Well, at any rate, this is Skater's operation.
Copied the DVDs here, and Chibueze sold for him, and somehow they both ended up in blood.
I never heard of this one either.
None of these movies are out yet.
Skater was sitting on a gold mine.
And living in a truck.
Let's get these back to the squad and see if they're real.
And this one?
"Skater stands up!"
- Hey, you stink!
- Come on!
Come on, get them up.
None of you guys are jealous that I starred in "goofing around"?
- None?
- No way!
/ Right.
He's bombing.
Five years, 110 episodes in 120 countries?
You suck!
I should be rich, right?
All right, well, guess what this is.
It's my latest royalty check from Wonder street films.
Guess how much?
Drumroll, please!
$49.37.
Hi-oh!
Not funny, pal.
You're right.
It's not funny.
I got screwed by Wonder street, as in, uh...
I wonder where they're hiding my money.
Raging against the studio.
That's his act?
It may not have been an act.
He was obsessed.
Except for the Harry Potter, all the unreleased DVDs were from the same studio.
Wonder which one.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
That was the head of the studio at Wonder street.
They're in deep mourning.
Over Skater?
Over the counterfeit DVDs.
Turns out that every title Skater had in his cave is from their holiday list.
Early cuts, all limited distribution, eyes only.
Did you tell them we're sorry for their loss?
They're ballistic.
If Skater weren't dead, they'd kill him.
Do they have any idea how he got hold of these copies?
They're positive the leaks aren't in-house.
Still, a lot of their work is outsourced.
Trailers, dubbing, special effects.
They're faxing us a list of everyone who had access to early cuts.
Let's hit the pavement.
You got your gumshoes on?
Two down, nine to go.
Translation films.
What's that?
It's a foreign language dubbing house.
Oh.
Apres vous.
Slow, slow.
Look.
That's the dream girl from Skater's wall.
Girl dresses like that up front usually means she has a big daddy in the back.
Skater's old friend Kirk.
Oh, no.
Gonna be all right, Wheeler?
Shut up.
Well, well, well.
Willie "Kirk" Tunis.
Is there someplace we could talk?
Uh, actually, I'm in the middle of a session.
Is that what you call it?
It's about your friend Skater.
Seems he got caught up with some DVD bootleggers.
He got killed for that?
Um, Mira, could you pour the detectives some coffees?
Nice walk.
Actress working temp?
No, no.
We met through friends.
And I really am in a session.
Yeah, well, uh, we were just wondering, seeing as this is a dubbing house, if your friend Skater had access to new releases.
Here?
You crazy?
The studios, they'd shut us down.
Every disk is locked up tight.
It's like a bank.
Two people have to be there when it's unsealed.
- I'll be right down, okay?
- Okay.
Two people, like you and Skater?
You said he was your best pal.
Well, was.
- But, uh...
- Thanks.
Other than our past, we didn't have anything in common.
I've got a name to protect, a reputation.
I would never jeopardize that.
That sounds a little rehearsed.
- Did it?
- Yeah.
That does happen a lot 'cause I was on TV, and my voice, my cadence, is so familiar that people can't believe it's just me talking.
They think it's a performance.
It's weird.
That must be it.
Willie?
They're waiting.
You're busy now.
Is there a chance you can come downtown later today, take a look at some mug shots of bootleggers?
Sure, sure.
3 o'clock okay?
- Oh, that'll be perfect.
- Great.
Appreciate it.
I thought that Willie said that he and Skater didn't have much in common.
I heard the cops came by today.
For a second.
Why not tell me, huh?
Maybe I can't trust you.
Maybe I need to have a talk with Willie.
Small scare.
Willie was fine with them.
There's no need to hurt Willie.
Yet.
No?
Why hurt the golden goose?
Why?
We just mess his beautiful golden goosey hair, hmm?
Yeah?
Walk with me.
I want you to meet a guy I brought in from special frauds.
He's turned something up.
Ira, this is my partner Logan.
Hey.
Tell him about the darknet.
Look at him.
"darknet." He's thinking,
"this guy's too old to be playing dungeons."
No, we're grateful for any help.
Okay.
Every one of these unreleased movie titles that got your guy Skater toasted were all, all posted weeks ago on the darknet.
So that would be like the underground internet where they download stolen movies?
Darknet, internet.
It's a pretty inaccessible area, but there are undercover net cops busting people.
Originally, it was just a few college kid movie fans file sharing and swapping bad prints.
The ones where they tape the films in the theater and their camcorders, and you got people talking and walking in front of the screen.
Right.
But the stuff Skater had.
Primo.
Straight from Wonder street.
Figure by now half the cities in Asia have copies of it out on the street.
Thanks for the info.
It's 3:30.
Kirk was supposed to be here by now.
So the studio screwed Skater,
Skater screwed the studio.
So why would the Albanians care?
They can't be working for Wonder street.
Oh, they can't?
Well, maybe they thought they had the exclusive with Skater.
There's no answer at reception.
Let's go there.
Please!
I didn't tell them anything.
Please.
Tell me, whose turn, you or Stephen?
I, I go.
You think we don't know.
We know what you're doing.
You told the police.
No!
No!
No!
Come on!
Mira, where's Willie?
Over there in the storage room.
Oh, my bad.
Police!
Hands up, hands up!
Against the wall!
You got him?
Okay, yeah.
Good.
- Call for a bus!
- Got it!
Willie.
Willie!
Is he gonna make it?
Another minute, he'd never have come back.
You saved his life.
Shouldn't you be interviewing him?
I tried.
If he was grateful, he kept it to himself.
I told your partner I don't know a Ditmir.
I don't know these guys.
You didn't run a DVD piracy scam with Skater, but somehow Skater had access to your studio cuts?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wish I knew more.
I can't believe I once had a crush on this guy.
Yeah.
We were all young and naive once.
Let him go.
The Albanians will tail him.
We should too.
Private charter jet.
Next stop, Costa Rica.
When they start to board, move.
Okay.
Again.
Keep shining.
Hi.
Uh, Willie Tunis.
Police!
Nice and easy, Ditmir.
Willie.
Come on, let's go.
Come on!
Nice shine.
It's gonna have to last you 60 years.
We've got Mira, Willie, and Ditmir in separate rooms.
Runners at every base.
Who do we pick off first?
Mira.
She's a survivor.
Let me take a pass at her while Willie watches.
We don't keep a cot here, so you might be more comfortable in a chair.
What if I stand, hmm?
Is that better for you?
That's much, much better.
Hey, what?
What the hell's going on?
I'd say Mira's about to feed you to my partner.
You can feed first, but tick-tock.
What do you want to know?
How does a girl like you end up with a Skater or a Willie?
Not pretty enough for TV stars?
Sure, you are.
One of those guys didn't even have a shower.
Skater.
He came to me to shower.
Sometimes, we shower three, four times a day.
- That's a lot of showers.
- I like to shower.
Do you?
Oh, I, uh, I love to shower.
In fact, you and I should, uh, talk about that sometime later.
Meanwhile, think you could help me out?
My boss, he, uh, needs some answers about how you met Skater.
Blind date.
Ditmir fixed me up.
Oh, they were friends.
Skater was selling DVDs from his truck.
First-class copies.
Ditmir saw them, he asks me to make friends with Skater.
Oh, so maybe he wanted to know who Skater's source was.
Final seconds.
Look, look, okay.
I duped some cuts, but it was just to help out Skater.
It was like he, he'd hit the bottomless bottom.
You and Skater hook up.
How long before you and Willie have a shower?
I work fast.
Willie, he shows me his setup, gives me personal tour.
I bet.
But you've had Willie and his studio cuts,
I mean, I guess that Skater's just deadweight.
I know nothing about that.
Nothing.
Put her in a holding cell.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait.
What about our shower?
I don't care for Skater or Willie!
I'll be with you.
I want to break away from these people.
Lady, you are these people.
Well...
That was a bold move.
Might've worked in Albania.
Don't tell me you still think that she's on your side.
She's scared.
She's afraid of Ditmir.
We were running away from all this.
Willie, this isn't a sitcom.
How do you think Ditmir ended up at the airport this morning, telepathy?
You heard her.
Ditmir pimped her out, first to Skater and then to you.
If you hadn't taken the bait, your buddy'd still be alive today.
That's not what happened!
Well, what did happen?
Off the record?
For now.
Okay.
Skater blew it.
He betrayed me and them.
I got Ditmir to hand him a grand a week finder's fee just to stay out of their way.
And there's Skater, he's selling from his stupid truck, side-dealing to Chibueze.
He should have just gone to ball games.
So that's why they killed him.
They tolerated him until a month ago when he posted all of my Christmas releases on some chat board.
Darknet.
The Albanians lost their exclusive, and Skater lost his life.
Betrayal.
It's a blood offense.
Skater never listened!
He never learned.
He never outgrew his part.
By going on the darknet, he got back at Ditmir, the studio, and at you.
What do you think could make a little nerd like Skater mad enough to get even with everyone?
Could it be that you took away his girlfriend?
She wanted to be with me.
What was it about Skater's girlfriend that you had to have?
On the show, if Skater liked a girl, she'd end up with Kirk.
What was the line?
"What's yours is mine, Skatinsky!"
You never outgrew your part either.
She loved me.
Hey, look, I'm Kirk.
He's Skater.
I, I took care of him.
I got him cash.
I get the girl.
I get the girl!
When Skater posted on the darknet, that was his death wish.
You killed him, not Ditmir.
I...
Look, I tried to look after him.
I did.
But these guys...
I didn't even know about it until Ditmir showed me Skater's noose.
These guys, we're gonna need you to testify against them.
No, no.
I said it was off the record.
Hey, Willie.
They killed your buddy.
You gotta do the right thing.
Against Ditmir?
But where am I gonna hide?
Witness protection.
Witness protection?
Do, do you get the extent of my fame?
I, I have over 129,000 google references!
You counted?
What am I gonna do, run the small-town framing shop?
I mean, this face does not blend in.
They're doing amazing, amazing things with plastic surgery today.
No!
No!
I am Kirk!
The Kirkster!
I get to walk down the street and have people shout at me,
"hey, you used to be Kirk!"
And I shout right back at them,
"that's right, baby.
I still am!"
"24/7!"
You wouldn't understand.
I get it.
You never know when someone's gonna push a napkin at you to autograph or ask you to scream, "give me el breako!"
Yeah.
Yeah, like that.
You ever wonder what it'd be like to let that all go, no Kirk to lug around?
Okay, make yourself beautiful.
You're going into a lineup.
I've been before, but for some reason, no one ever picks me.
He, he knows I'm in here.
It's one-way, Willie, like on TV.
We'll take care of you.
He'll never find you.
It's number two.
He told me he killed Skater.
He showed me the noose he used.
Ditmir.
Stick around.
Tough luck, huh?
For you too.
Why?
Am I in blood now?
That's right.
You did the right thing, Willie.
Oh, Willie...
Willie's gone.
So's Kirk.
And how do you feel?
I've never felt more relieved in my whole life.
Previously, on Stargate SG-1...
The Rand Protectorate and the Caledonian Federation have been locked in a state of cold war for decades.
- This is insane
- Soren's forces are moving in on this facility.
I can get you to the Stargate, but we have to go now.
I'm not blind Leda.
I know that you and Daniel have grown close during his convalescence.
Jared, it's not what you think.
I've seen entire planets wiped out because they refused to follow the Ori.
If a Prior visits your world... leave.
- What's up?
- Incoming wormhole from Tegalus.
A Jared Kane is requesting to be let through.
Says he needs to speak to you, and it's urgent.
On radio.
Jared, this is Daniel.
What's wrong?
Dr. Jackson, I have very little time.
I've gained access to the Stargate without my government's authorization.
Please allow me to come through.
I am alone and unarmed.
Open the iris.
Okay, Jared, it's safe to come through.
Stand down.
- Dr. Jackson...
- Jared, this is Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell.
Tegalus... post-apocalyptic warring superpowers with deep-seated political difference, that Jared Kane.
It's nice to meet you.
Your government stopped responding to our communiques months ago.
We'd assumed that you...
Completely destroyed each other?
Not quite yet.
I was going to say no longer wanted our help, but that'll do.
No, the Rand Protectorate is still struggling to rebuild and defend itself from the Caledonian Federation.
Okay, what's so urgent?
Five months ago, a man came through the Stargate.
- He called himself a Prior of the Ori.
- Here we go.
Yes, we're aware of the Priors and what they're preaching.
The Prior wasn't just offering us religion.
He offered us power.
In exchange for our embracing the Ori, he gave our government designs for a weapon that could be launched into orbit, a satellite capable of giving us total domination over the Caledonians.
Okay, assuming your people intend on building this weapon, how long before it's completed?
24 hours ago, a Caledonian military outpost was completely vaporized in a demonstration.
The weapon is already operational.
Season 9
- Episode 15 Ethon
How long until your government makes its next move?
Our President has given their leader, Minister Chaska, a deadline of five days.
After that, if the Caledonians don't surrender to Rand occupation, they'll be destroyed.
And the Prior instructed you to do this?
Rand has been in disarray since the missile attacks last year.
Intelligence reports were filtering in that said the Caledonians were preparing a full-scale ground assault.
They were going to invade and attempt to topple what was left of Rand once and for all.
Caledonia wasn't interested in hearing from this Prior?
The Prior asked our leaders if he could spread his word to the Caledonians as well.
Of course they would never accept anything that Rand was already embracing.
President Nadal explained that to the Prior.
He said anyone who didn't accept Origin must be destroyed.
Man, these guys got a bottomless bag of tricks, don't they?
I'm guessing it was also the Prior that convinced your people that having a relationship with us was no longer necessary.
It was already clear your government wasn't going to offer us the type of weapons and technology this Prior was offering us.
You see... we weren't just on the verge of suffering defeat at the hands of the Caledonians.
We were on the verge of collapsing as a nation, but now, after what you've told me of these Ori and the Priors,
I fear that may have been a better way to go.
We appreciate your situation, but
- what exactly do you want from us?
- These are the earliest schematics for the weapon.
Unfortunately, they're not complete.
The Prior gave us step-by-step instructions in stages.
Making sure he kept you under his thumb.
He said it was so he could make sure each stage was completed properly before we moved on to the next.
It's the best I could do under the circumstances.
Access became restricted soon after some of us in government voiced our disapproval about building the weapon.
You wish us to destroy the weapon.
It's the only chance we have to stop things before they go too far.
Just to be clear... you're doing this to save Caledonians?
You don't hate them for bombing your country and killing so many of your people?
I do, but I refuse to see any more lives, be they Rand or Caledonian, senselessly lost due to archaic prejudices or religious extremism.
- This has to stop.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?
- What are we doing?
- Talking privately.
I'm sure general Landry won't mind.
You want the big chair?
Not me.
I'll sit here.
Sam, he's in Washington.
Yeah.
Right.
Let me just start this by saying a lot of this is actually our fault.
There wouldn't have been a war on Tegalus if we hadn't gone there in the first place.
General O'Neill probably said it best.
"The minute we step through the Gates, we're sticking our collective noses where they don't belong".
We did offer to help them rebuild.
- An offer they eventually declined.
- Because they were being influenced by a Prior.
And this satellite thing takes it to a whole new level.
The Ori are now arming their followers.
Who says they won't eventually help them build ships capable of attacking other planets?
We need to nip this trend squarely in the bud.
So, what, we just fly in there and blow it up?
Yeah.
Unless you have a better idea.
All Tegalans, both Rand and Caledonian alike, deserve to know the truth.
If we tell them what we know, who the Ori really are, they might be convinced to dismantle this weapon themselves.
You think they'll listen?
Let's just propose it to Kane, and see if Rand will hear us out.
So can we can use these plans to build ourselves a satellite weapon?
Hey, you've got to ask.
These plans are incomplete.
I mean, it's not even clear what's powering the weapon.
- Kane did say they were early schematics.
- So, not useful?
Well, enough to see that it's not very efficient.
For example... these capacitors take several minutes to store enough power to fire the weapon and then again before it can repeat.
Wow, you'd think an...
Ori weapon would be more advanced.
The Ori may have designed it for them, but Rand still had to build it using the resources and technology at their disposal.
Now, remember that it wouldn't take much by our standards to give Rand vast military superiority over Caledonia.
Then it can be easily destroyed.
If these plans are an accurate indication.
Right.
So we'll take Prometheus for this.
Shouldn't be a problem.
The satellite appears to be a predominantly offensive weapon.
- No defenses?
- Well, it stands to reason.
Rand knows that Caledonia has nothing even close to capable of reaching orbit.
Although, there do appear to be sensors built into the targeting system, so our approach may be detected.
The Prometheus is protected by Asgard shield technology.
Exactly.
Now, as I said, even if they do see us coming, the weapon will take a few minutes to charge up.
We should be able to emerge from hyperspace and take a shot at it before it can respond.
If, for any reason, it doesn't go well, we jump back into hyperspace.
Anything yet?
Give them some time.
They seemed shocked that you were here.
I'm sure they were.
You don't think they'll listen to us?
Our people suffered greatly after the war.
They needed to believe there was a reason for what was happening to them.
And the Prior provided that.
He said our suffering was a test to see who was worthy.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, your planet's not alone.
Kane, I have to ask.
Leda?
Five months ago, while Rand was deciding whether to accept Origin or not, a disease swept through the country.
Thousands became deathly ill.
The Prior said those who believed and embraced the Ori would be cured.
That's when people everywhere began accepting them as gods.
We watched... so many barter away their beliefs in exchange for their lives.
But, Leda... she... she refused to accept it.
I am sorry.
Dr. Jackson.
We just received a communique from the Rand government.
They want to talk.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.
What happens if your people don't hear from us?
I told them to proceed with destroying the weapon.
President Nadal.
Senator Kane.
This is Dr. Daniel Jackson.
I know who he is.
I'm here representing Earth on a diplomatic mission.
I am here to officially inform you, Jared Kane, you are under arrest for treason.
Excuse me?
You allowed us to come here under false pretenses?
Dr. Daniel Jackson, your government has knowingly harbored a felon.
As well, it seems they are in possession of top-secret documents vital to the security of this country.
As of now, you are both considered enemies of the state and will be detained until trial can be set.
Approaching the planet, Sir.
Prepare to lock on Dr. Jackson's locator beacon the moment we drop out of hyperspace.
Yes, Sir.
I guess I can assume that any kind of trial will be rigged?
Honestly, we'll be lucky to get that far.
President Nadal has been paranoid about Caledonian spies for some time now.
Because I betrayed him this way, he... may assume I'm also part of that network.
Great.
I don't suppose your country has any laws against torture?
No.
- I applaud your courage, Kane.
- Commander Pernaux,
- Dr. Jackson.
Dr. Jackson...
- Yeah, I got it.
What I don't understand is why you came back.
Dr. Jackson and I thought there were some things the Rand people needed to know.
The only thing I need to know are the names of those among us who are working for the Caledonians.
Just because I went to Earth for help doesn't mean I've also given information to the Caledonians or know who might have.
Earth is responsible for our current state of affairs.
Turning to them is an act of a desperate man, Kane.
Kane turned to us in the hopes of preventing you from making a catastrophic mistake.
The Priors are not telling you everything about the Ori.
You need to hear me out before you use that weapon to wipe out the Caledonians.
So you admit, you sympathize with Caledonia?
That's not what he's saying.
How the next few days unfold is entirely up to you.
But until I find out who else is working with you,
I guarantee neither of you will know a moment's peace.
- I have a signal from Dr. Jackson's locator beacon.
- Beam him directly onto the bridge.
I take it this means things aren't going so well.
Coupled with the fact that we haven't heard from him since he left two days ago...
- We have located the satellite.
- Lock on target.
This will be perceived as an act of aggression against Rand.
We could be risking any chance of negotiating for Daniel's safe return.
Commander.
Mr. President.
The satellite's sensors have detected a ship closing on its position.
- Target has been acquired, Sir.
- We've got the satellite dead to rights.
We can hail them and ask for Dr. Jackson in exchange.
That would not accomplish the goal of this mission.
Jackson knew it might come to this.
He told us to proceed no matter what.
He wouldn't want us to trade his life for thousands, possibly millions of Caledonians.
Well, it's your call, colonels.
All I'm asking is that you make up your mind quickly.
Sir, we're detecting a power buildup from within the satellite.
Its attitude is changing.
- We're being targeted.
- Sound general quarters.
Full power to forward shield generators and maintain course and speed.
- Do it.
- Fire!
Firing missiles.
Missiles detonated prior to impact.
Target remains intact, Sir.
It looks like it's being protected by a shield.
Defensive capabilities must have been added.
Okay... now what?
Shields are holding.
Recommend firing a warning shot.
We have been attacked, Commander.
We must respond in kind.
Target the ship.
The Earth vessel has been targeted.
Weapon's primed and ready.
Fire.
Evasive maneuvers, full military thrust.
- Return fire with forward rail guns.
- Sub light engines aren't responding.
Weapons are down!
We've lost hull integrity and life support on decks 3 through 7.
Seal them off!
- That blast cut through our shields at full strength.
- I know, I don't understand how.
- Sensors detect that the weapon is recharging!
- We've only got minutes.
- Hyperdrive status?
- Hyperdrive is offline.
Hull integrity is too unstable.
Medical teams reporting four casualties, eight crew members still unaccounted for.
That thing can only fire at one target at a time.
Go.
Scramble Blue Squadron.
We'll see if we can do some damage in close.
Go, go!
Tracking multiple smaller ships attacking the satellite.
The shield is holding.
By the grace of the gods.
Thirty seconds till weapon is primed and ready.
Target the large vessel again.
It's no use, Blue Leader.
We're not getting through.
Keep at it, boys.
Lieutenant, I need sublight engines now.
I'm trying, Sir.
Auxiliary systems aren't kicking in.
- They can't.
The two main power relays have been damaged.
- Can it be repaired?
We need to re-route power through the bypass conduits.
Here.
We should get limited sublight capability back.
Marks, you're with colonel Carter.
Go.
We need to get up two levels.
Captain!
The elevator's not safe!
Right... sorry...
I don't know what I was thinking.
Shields?
Forward shields at 40%.
Divert all shield power to forward generators.
Sir, sensors indicate that the weapon is reaching maximum power.
All hands, brace for impact!
This damn thing's shield is not weakening.
I got you.
- Are you alright?
- My arm...
Bridge, this is Carter.
Can you beam us up to auxiliary control room two?
Negative, Colonel, control room no longer has life support.
The large vessel appears to be disabled.
Shall I broadcast a call for surrender?
The book of Origin tells us that enemies of the Ori show no mercy in their attempts to draw us away from the path.
We must face this attack with all the strength we have been given.
Finish them.
Prometheus, this is Blue Leader.
Request status report.
Not too good right now, Blue Leader.
Can we assist?
Negative, Blue Leader, negative.
Docking bays are too unstable for safe return.
Stand by for orders.
Roger that.
Bridge, this is Carter.
We need deck 15 unsealed.
Unseal it, if you can.
If the aft power control panel is still intact, we should be able to rig the naquadah generator and re-route power to sublight propulsion.
You've got about two minutes, Colonel.
It's not enough time, Sir.
- Open a channel, broadcast on all frequencies.
- Yes, Sir.
This is Colonel Lionel Pendergast of the Earth Vessel Prometheus calling the Rand Protectorate.
Your attack on our vessel has severely damaged our engines and rendered our weapons systems inoperable.
We are willing negotiate the terms of our surrender.
Rand Protectorate, this is the Earth vessel Prometheus.
We wish to negotiate our surrender.
Repeat, we wish to negotiate our surrender.
- Okay, fire it up.
- Don't we need to test the power flow?
- No time.
- But...
I know!
Do it.
Alright, this is useless.
Blue Squadron, this is Blue Leader.
Break off the attack and scramble formation between the Prometheus and the weapon.
Maybe one of us will get lucky and take a portion of the next shot.
I would not consider that lucky, Colonel Mitchell.
Well, it could be for anybody aboard Prometheus.
This is President Nadal of the Rand Protectorate addressing the Earth vessel.
Please explain your brazen act of aggression against our nation.
Our actions have been misconstrued as hostile.
We are here to investigate why an emissary we sent to your planet,
Dr. Daniel Jackson, has ceased all communications with us.
And yet your first act upon entering our planet's space was to fire on our defense satellite.
But we detected that your satellite was powering up and aiming at us, which we took to be the first act of aggression.
We merely responded in kind.
Now... we are no longer a threat to you.
I have people aboard this vessel who are in need of medical attention, and I am venting atmosphere.
Please, consider our request for surrender.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Your planet sent this ship to attack us.
I have no desire to take more lives.
You tell us what we want to know,
I will accept their surrender.
Who else was involved in this attack?
What other actions are the Caledonians planning?
We're not spies.
I came here to convince your people to dismantle this weapon yourselves before any of this became necessary.
Why would we do that?
I have tried to explain.
Who helped you gain access to the Stargate?
I acted alone.
You are lying.
You are part of a spy network helping to supply the Caledonians with classified information.
Did you ever think that maybe the Caledonians are being leaked information
- because not everyone in your country agrees with what you're doing?
- The weapon is charged.
Wait!
Please.
Just listen to me before you go murdering defenseless people.
We are the ones defending ourselves.
Your ship attacked us.
Sensors detect the weapon is fully charged.
- Colonel Carter, I need good news now.
- A couple of more minutes.
We don't have it, Sam.
I'm sorry.
It's over.
Give me as much power as you can.
Re-route it from the shields and get me all functioning internal Asgard beam sensors back online.
- Sir?
- We're abandoning ship.
Begin the evacuation orders.
I want all personnel to beam down to the planet's surface.
Find me a nice open field anywhere in Caledonia.
Yes, Sir.
And broadcast the locations of all the active sensor sites.
This is the Prometheus to all F-302's.
We have begun our evacuation.
I advise you to get clear of the ship and meet us at the rendezvous coordinates on the planet.
Affirmative, Prometheus.
I'll handle the final transport commands.
Everyone else is to report to the nearest beam-out site.
Let's go, people!
That's an order.
Move!
- Sir, I...
- Get out of here.
Get out of here!
Go.
If I don't finish tying this in, we'll run out of power before everyone can be beamed off.
Go.
We must not fail the gods.
We must embrace our destiny.
- Fire the weapon.
- Wait!
- No!
Ah hell...
The Earth vessel has been destroyed.
The loss of your people is regrettable, but your planet and the Caledonians must know our resolve.
You know full well the Caledonians would rather sacrifice themselves than submit.
You'll be forced to commit genocide and destroy them.
A year ago, they launched a first strike against us.
They obviously had no problem with doing the same.
When does it stop?
When do we stop killing each other over wars started by our fathers and their fathers before them?
This is no longer about Rand or Caledonia.
It is.
We need to set aside our differences and fight the threat of the Ori together.
Goran, how long have we known each other?
Please... believe what Dr. Jackson has told you about them.
With my own eyes,
I saw the Prior bring the satellite to life merely by touching it with his staff.
Neither Rand nor Caledonia have the technology capable of resisting such power.
What choice do we have?
Look...
I can't make you any promises, but we have already developed a machine that neutralizes the Priors' powers.
Now, as far as we know, they've only been able to travel within our galaxy by use of the Stargate, and you can either bury your Gate, or we can teach you to build an iris system like ours.
Nadal has lost all sense of reason.
The book of Origin is just one big lie meant to seduce us into meaningless worship.
The Ori just want to use us, and killing in their name is not self-defense.
It's murder.
We were monitoring the entire exchange.
To our knowledge, 76 crew were recovered in Caledonian territory.
There were over 115 people aboard that ship.
Do you have any sort of a manifest, a list of names we can compare to those recovered?
Not on me, no.
So where are our people?
The transport arrived moments ago.
Teal'c, Cameron.
Sam!
You are a sight for sore eyes.
It is good to see you alive, Colonel Carter.
We feared the worst.
Where's Pendergast?
He wasn't with us.
Our security forces did extensive sweeps of the area where you appeared.
No other survivors were found.
This is Minister Chaska, leader of the Caledonian Federation.
I am thankful you survived such a tragic event, Colonel.
I hope we can offer you and your crew some comfort here.
She's pretty much up to speed on what's going on.
We were, of course, praying for your success, but with the destruction of your vessel, I fear that any hope for a peaceful solution to this crisis has been lost.
And you will not surrender?
Our people would rather die than live under Rand rule.
We will retaliate against any attack with the full forces at our disposal.
Any word?
Nothing.
The Rand government continues to deny any knowledge of Daniel Jackson's existence.
Our contacts tell us he was seen alive in the Rand command bunker during the exchange with your ship.
He has not been seen since.
Any progress here?
Well, these satellite schematics are far more detailed than the ones Kane provided.
As we saw firsthand, shields were added late in the design process.
I'm still not sure what's powering it or how it was able to penetrate our Asgard design shields, but there is one bit of good news.
According to this, all commands for the satellite originate from Rand's main control facility, and maintaining a shield around the satellite is a huge power drain, so it's only activated when a threat is detected.
Are you saying the Prometheus was destroyed because we hesitated to fire when we dropped out of hyperspace?
We hesitated out of concern for the safe return of Daniel Jackson.
We also hesitated to leave once our weapons were ineffective.
However, it seems that you are saying if we were to destroy the Rand control facility, the weapon itself would become vulnerable to attack.
Then we could take a 302 back up there and finish the job.
No, the Rand facility is part of an underground bunker complex that was strong enough to survive our last missile attack.
Since then, Rand has developed an early-warning radar system and anti-missile defenses.
Wait up.
What about sabotage?
You said you had people on the inside.
Our agents have already made several attempts.
Security is too tight for them to mount any sort of effective strike.
Actually, we don't have to hit the bunker itself to knock out satellite control.
If we can sever the link between the facility and the weapon, even temporarily...
You're talking about an E.M. Pulse.
Even a small one detonated in the atmosphere above the facility should interfere with their ability to control the satellite.
E.M. Pulse?
It would disable their electronic devices.
They'd be totally blind.
For a short time.
You possess such technology?
You wouldn't have suggested it if you didn't have something in mind.
Well, like most discoveries, it was a bit of an accident.
After the battle with Anubis' fleet over Antarctica, small random E.M. fields were detected by Prometheus during the cleanup.
It took us a while to figure out.
Are you going to tell me that an F-302 gives off an E.M. Pulse when it blows up?
It was one of the things I was working on at area 51.
We think it has something to do with a concussive force interfering with the artificial gravity field generated by the inertial dampeners.
So how do we remote-fly a 302 over there and blow it up?
We don't have to.
All we have to do is harvest the inertial dampener and rig it to one of the Caledonian missiles.
What about their anti-missile defenses?
We can use that same 302's radar-jamming technology to make your missile invisible to Rand.
Still, if this does not work as you are planning, it will be seen as an offensive against Rand.
President Nadal will surely respond by stepping up the deadline for our surrender, and he'll use the satellite weapon against us.
This will work.
I don't know what to say... how to take it all back.
I shouldn't have come to you.
Look, right now, I just have to believe there are survivors.
You think that's really possible?
The Prometheus has beaming technology.
Had... beaming technology, whatever that is.
Look, the bottom line is, we can't lose focus of why we came back here in the first place.
There has to be a way out of this and
I got the feeling Pernaux was listening to us.
Daniel...
I know the history between Caledonia and Rand makes things seem impossible, but sometimes, an outside perspective helps.
In the past, I've found the key to these types of disputes is to... to get both parties on equal footing, just to get the process of talking with each other going again.
Do you ever give up?
Not until I'm dead.
And sometimes, not even then.
Intelligence is reporting visual confirmation of a missile launch from Caledonia.
Early-warning systems detect no missile entering our airspace.
- One missile?
- So it seems.
Possibly a test, then?
They are not going to surrender.
They are preparing to launch a preemptive first strike given the Earth attack on the satellite has failed.
You don't know that.
They still have two days until the deadline.
Get me Minister Chaska.
President Nadal is on line for you, Ma'am.
Doesn't look like they've employed countermeasures.
The radar jamming is working.
The timing is too coincidental.
I suspect he has spies who witnessed the launch.
You need to stall, or else they'll activate the satellite shield out of sheer paranoia.
Patch him through.
President Nadal, this is Minister Chaska.
Mr. President, if you are calling about the recent missile launch, please forgive me.
I should have called you immediately.
The launch was entirely accidental.
It seems there was some confusion when new launch protocol codes were distributed recently.
Obviously, the payload was detonated as soon as we realized what had happened.
Needless to say, everyone here is a little on edge as of late, but, thankfully, we have ample precautions in place to prevent such an occurrence from being a serious threat.
Indeed.
Minister Chaska, while your military's incompetence does concern me, the reason I am calling is to discuss the impending deadline.
I see.
Our government is still in the process of debating its options.
As promised, we will give you an answer by the designated deadline.
I am sorry the decision has not been easier for you.
We shall talk again soon.
Air command, this is Blue Leader.
We are wheels up.
Roger that.
Package is on its way.
We are 30 seconds from detonation over target.
Nice job.
He didn't believe a word of it.
We're getting a report from coastal monitoring base four.
May be visual of an incoming missile.
Why isn't it showing up on our radar?
Sir, satellite sensors are detecting a single small ship on approach.
Possibly one of the Earth fighters that landed in Caledonia.
Activate the missile shields.
What just happened?
I don't know.
We've lost power.
All systems are down.
Backup power is supposed to be isolated.
The systems that activate it are down.
We can't control the satellite.
Get it back!
Get me a radio and a phone in here that works.
Blue Leader, this is base.
The package has been delivered.
Window of opportunity is now open.
Roger that.
We have cleared the atmosphere.
Two minutes from weapons range.
The blast did no apparent damage beyond the power outage, which seems to be limited to the area immediately around the command facility.
To our knowledge, the Caledonians do not possess the level of technology required to do this.
Such a weapon could only have been given to them by your people.
I hope so.
How do we undo this?
You tell me now, or I'll have you executed!
Based on its speed and trajectory, the Earth ship will reach the satellite in less than one minute.
Do you think if the Ori were true gods, they would allow the Caledonians to do this?
Look, I understand your fear of the Prior and why you feel you have no choice, but there is another way out of this.
What would you have me do?
Let me use the radio.
I can contact the ship that's about to destroy the satellite and get them to call it off.
Why would you do this?
Because I still believe a peaceful compromise can be reached out of all this.
I'm listening.
This is Daniel Jackson.
Come in, please.
Whoever's flying the 302, if you can hear me, please respond.
This is Daniel Jackson.
Come in, please.
Jackson, go ahead.
Mitchell?
Yeah.
You okay?
For the moment.
You?
Well, all things considered...
Listen, me and Teal'c are getting ready to bag ourselves an evil Ori satellite.
Yeah, so glad I caught you.
Listen, the Rand want to offer the Caledonians a deal.
Really?
May I?
Please.
Daniel, this is Sam.
Hey, Sam, good to hear your voice.
Yours too.
I'm here with Minister Chaska of the Caledonian Federation.
We'd like to know what Rand is offering.
In exchange for leaving the satellite intact,
Rand is offering Caledonia the Stargate.
Rand is offering the Gate and a limited cease-fire, so all those from Caledonia who do not want to follow Origin and wish to seek refuge on another planet may do so.
They want us to leave our home... our planet.
Jackson, are you sure about this?
I've got a clean shot at this thing, and I am in favor of taking it.
Listen, the Rand built that satellite in less than a year, and I can tell you their resolve is... pretty steady.
If we blow this one up, they're just going to build another, and as far as the Caledonians go, well...
Sam, you'll just have to explain to them that the Priors may not give them much choice, regardless of what Rand decides to do.
I've seen the Priors wipe out entire planets for refusing to follow the Ori.
You will not fight them with us?
Well, we would try, but, honestly, there's only so much we can do.
Will the Prior not follow us wherever we go?
Maybe, but for now...
Look, this offer's not going to be on the table long, and
I realize there's a lot to be worked out, but at least it's a start.
At the very least, the Rand now believe that you have the ability to disable the satellite whenever you want.
Which they will surely counter in time.
Tell colonel Mitchell to call it off.
Blue Leader, this is Carter.
Minister Chaska is requesting that you stand down.
Alright, Jackson, but you folks had better be damn sure about this.
Backup power is online.
Satellite control has been re-established.
Sensors detect the Earth ship is veering away from the target.
Activate the shields.
The ship is no longer a threat.
Power the weapon.
What?
Target the Caledonian capital building.
Sir, perhaps we should take a moment...
You will abide by my authority.
- Power the weapon now!
- Powering the weapon.
Our sensors detect the weapon's shields have become active.
Jackson, what's going on down there?
The satellite is powering up its weapon and targeting the planet.
We had a deal.
President Nadal, explain your actions immediately.
President Nadal!
You gave your word!
I gave my soul to the Ori who offered us all salvation.
Anyone who rejects that is a fool!
They are all Caledonians, for God's sake!
They all deserved to die long before the Prior showed us the path to enlightenment.
Shut down the satellite.
Don't listen to him.
Now!
Arrest the commander.
Stand down!
I won't let you do this, Nadal.
Do as I say!
Put your weapons down!
Now!
Get a medical unit in here.
Go!
Go!
Shut down the satellite.
He's dead.
You heard him the President is dead.
Commander Pernaux is next in command.
- He's also the one who killed the President.
- The President violated an international treaty.
You want to be the one responsible for destroying a city full of people when this goes to tribunal?
Shut it down now!
Hang on.
Help is coming.
The deal... will stand.
Hey.
Haven't seen you since the memorial service.
Yeah.
It was a rough day.
So, where have you been?
I... hand-delivered Landry's letter to colonel Pendergast's wife and kids.
They need to know that he died saving his crew... that his death mattered.
Well, 76 people survived.
That's a testament to his leadership.
And yours.
We never would've got off that planet if you hadn't brokered the deal.
So, I take it, then, you haven't heard.
Heard what?
Soon after we left, the talks broke down.
And?
And we've been unable to make contact with them.
General Landry had the Daedalus re-route on its way back from Atlantis.
It seems the Caledonians weren't content to just leave their fair planet.
They launched an attack.
And Rand responded.
The Stargate is presumed buried in the rubble.
Rough day.
Rough day.
Previously, on Stargate SG-1...
The Rand Protectorate and the Caledonian Federation have been locked in a state of cold war for decades.
- This is insane
- Soren's forces are moving in on this facility.
I can get you to the Stargate, but we have to go now.
I'm not blind Leda.
I know that you and Daniel have grown close during his convalescence.
Jared, it's not what you think.
I've seen entire planets wiped out because they refused to follow the Ori.
If a Prior visits your world... leave.
- What's up?
- Incoming wormhole from Tegalus.
A Jared Kane is requesting to be let through.
Says he needs to speak to you, and it's urgent.
On radio.
Jared, this is Daniel.
What's wrong?
Dr. Jackson, I have very little time.
I've gained access to the Stargate without my government's authorization.
Please allow me to come through.
I am alone and unarmed.
Open the iris.
Okay, Jared, it's safe to come through.
Stand down.
- Dr. Jackson...
- Jared, this is Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell.
Tegalus... post-apocalyptic warring superpowers with deep-seated political difference, that Jared Kane.
It's nice to meet you.
Your government stopped responding to our communiques months ago.
We'd assumed that you...
Completely destroyed each other?
Not quite yet.
I was going to say no longer wanted our help, but that'll do.
No, the Rand Protectorate is still struggling to rebuild and defend itself from the Caledonian Federation.
Okay, what's so urgent?
Five months ago, a man came through the Stargate.
- He called himself a Prior of the Ori.
- Here we go.
Yes, we're aware of the Priors and what they're preaching.
The Prior wasn't just offering us religion.
He offered us power.
In exchange for our embracing the Ori, he gave our government designs for a weapon that could be launched into orbit, a satellite capable of giving us total domination over the Caledonians.
Okay, assuming your people intend on building this weapon, how long before it's completed?
24 hours ago, a Caledonian military outpost was completely vaporized in a demonstration.
The weapon is already operational.
Season 9
- Episode 15 "Ethon"
How long until your government makes its next move?
Our President has given their leader, Minister Chaska, a deadline of five days.
After that, if the Caledonians don't surrender to Rand occupation, they'll be destroyed.
And the Prior instructed you to do this?
Rand has been in disarray since the missile attacks last year.
Intelligence reports were filtering in that said the Caledonians were preparing a full-scale ground assault.
They were going to invade and attempt to topple what was left of Rand once and for all.
Caledonia wasn't interested in hearing from this Prior?
The Prior asked our leaders if he could spread his word to the Caledonians as well.
Of course they would never accept anything that Rand was already embracing.
President Nadal explained that to the Prior.
He said anyone who didn't accept Origin must be destroyed.
Man, these guys got a bottomless bag of tricks, don't they?
I'm guessing it was also the Prior that convinced your people that having a relationship with us was no longer necessary.
It was already clear your government wasn't going to offer us the type of weapons and technology this Prior was offering us.
You see... we weren't just on the verge of suffering defeat at the hands of the Caledonians.
We were on the verge of collapsing as a nation, but now, after what you've told me of these Ori and the Priors,
I fear that may have been a better way to go.
We appreciate your situation, but
- what exactly do you want from us?
- These are the earliest schematics for the weapon.
Unfortunately, they're not complete.
The Prior gave us step-by-step instructions in stages.
Making sure he kept you under his thumb.
He said it was so he could make sure each stage was completed properly before we moved on to the next.
It's the best I could do under the circumstances.
Access became restricted soon after some of us in government voiced our disapproval about building the weapon.
You wish us to destroy the weapon.
It's the only chance we have to stop things before they go too far.
Just to be clear... you're doing this to save Caledonians?
You don't hate them for bombing your country and killing so many of your people?
I do, but I refuse to see any more lives, be they Rand or Caledonian, senselessly lost due to archaic prejudices or religious extremism.
- This has to stop.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?
- What are we doing?
- Talking privately.
I'm sure general Landry won't mind.
You want the big chair?
Not me.
I'll sit here.
Sam, he's in Washington.
Yeah.
Right.
Let me just start this by saying a lot of this is actually our fault.
There wouldn't have been a war on Tegalus if we hadn't gone there in the first place.
General O'Neill probably said it best.
"The minute we step through the Gates, we're sticking our collective noses where they don't belong".
We did offer to help them rebuild.
- An offer they eventually declined.
- Because they were being influenced by a Prior.
And this satellite thing takes it to a whole new level.
The Ori are now arming their followers.
Who says they won't eventually help them build ships capable of attacking other planets?
We need to nip this trend squarely in the bud.
So, what, we just fly in there and blow it up?
Yeah.
Unless you have a better idea.
All Tegalans, both Rand and Caledonian alike, deserve to know the truth.
If we tell them what we know, who the Ori really are, they might be convinced to dismantle this weapon themselves.
You think they'll listen?
Let's just propose it to Kane, and see if Rand will hear us out.
So can we can use these plans to build ourselves a satellite weapon?
Hey, you've got to ask.
These plans are incomplete.
I mean, it's not even clear what's powering the weapon.
- Kane did say they were early schematics.
- So, not useful?
Well, enough to see that it's not very efficient.
For example... these capacitors take several minutes to store enough power to fire the weapon and then again before it can repeat.
Wow, you'd think an...
Ori weapon would be more advanced.
The Ori may have designed it for them, but Rand still had to build it using the resources and technology at their disposal.
Now, remember that it wouldn't take much by our standards to give Rand vast military superiority over Caledonia.
Then it can be easily destroyed.
If these plans are an accurate indication.
Right.
So we'll take Prometheus for this.
Shouldn't be a problem.
The satellite appears to be a predominantly offensive weapon.
- No defenses?
- Well, it stands to reason.
Rand knows that Caledonia has nothing even close to capable of reaching orbit.
Although, there do appear to be sensors built into the targeting system, so our approach may be detected.
The Prometheus is protected by Asgard shield technology.
Exactly.
Now, as I said, even if they do see us coming, the weapon will take a few minutes to charge up.
We should be able to emerge from hyperspace and take a shot at it before it can respond.
If, for any reason, it doesn't go well, we jump back into hyperspace.
Anything yet?
Give them some time.
They seemed shocked that you were here.
I'm sure they were.
You don't think they'll listen to us?
Our people suffered greatly after the war.
They needed to believe there was a reason for what was happening to them.
And the Prior provided that.
He said our suffering was a test to see who was worthy.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, your planet's not alone.
Kane, I have to ask.
Leda?
Five months ago, while Rand was deciding whether to accept Origin or not, a disease swept through the country.
Thousands became deathly ill.
The Prior said those who believed and embraced the Ori would be cured.
That's when people everywhere began accepting them as gods.
We watched... so many barter away their beliefs in exchange for their lives.
But, Leda... she... she refused to accept it.
I am sorry.
Dr. Jackson.
We just received a communique from the Rand government.
They want to talk.
.
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.
What happens if your people don't hear from us?
I told them to proceed with destroying the weapon.
President Nadal.
Senator Kane.
This is Dr. Daniel Jackson.
I know who he is.
I'm here representing Earth on a diplomatic mission.
I am here to officially inform you, Jared Kane, you are under arrest for treason.
Excuse me?
You allowed us to come here under false pretenses?
Dr. Daniel Jackson, your government has knowingly harbored a felon.
As well, it seems they are in possession of top-secret documents vital to the security of this country.
As of now, you are both considered enemies of the state and will be detained until trial can be set.
Approaching the planet, Sir.
Prepare to lock on Dr. Jackson's locator beacon the moment we drop out of hyperspace.
Yes, Sir.
I guess I can assume that any kind of trial will be rigged?
Honestly, we'll be lucky to get that far.
President Nadal has been paranoid about Caledonian spies for some time now.
Because I betrayed him this way, he... may assume I'm also part of that network.
Great.
I don't suppose your country has any laws against torture?
No.
- I applaud your courage, Kane.
- Commander Pernaux,
- Dr. Jackson.
Dr. Jackson...
- Yeah, I got it.
What I don't understand is why you came back.
Dr. Jackson and I thought there were some things the Rand people needed to know.
The only thing I need to know are the names of those among us who are working for the Caledonians.
Just because I went to Earth for help doesn't mean I've also given information to the Caledonians or know who might have.
Earth is responsible for our current state of affairs.
Turning to them is an act of a desperate man, Kane.
Kane turned to us in the hopes of preventing you from making a catastrophic mistake.
The Priors are not telling you everything about the Ori.
You need to hear me out before you use that weapon to wipe out the Caledonians.
So you admit, you sympathize with Caledonia?
That's not what he's saying.
How the next few days unfold is entirely up to you.
But until I find out who else is working with you,
I guarantee neither of you will know a moment's peace.
- I have a signal from Dr. Jackson's locator beacon.
- Beam him directly onto the bridge.
I take it this means things aren't going so well.
Coupled with the fact that we haven't heard from him since he left two days ago...
- We have located the satellite.
- Lock on target.
This will be perceived as an act of aggression against Rand.
We could be risking any chance of negotiating for Daniel's safe return.
Commander.
Mr. President.
The satellite's sensors have detected a ship closing on its position.
- Target has been acquired, Sir.
- We've got the satellite dead to rights.
We can hail them and ask for Dr. Jackson in exchange.
That would not accomplish the goal of this mission.
Jackson knew it might come to this.
He told us to proceed no matter what.
He wouldn't want us to trade his life for thousands, possibly millions of Caledonians.
Well, it's your call, colonels.
All I'm asking is that you make up your mind quickly.
Sir, we're detecting a power buildup from within the satellite.
Its attitude is changing.
- We're being targeted.
- Sound general quarters.
Full power to forward shield generators and maintain course and speed.
- Do it.
- Fire!
Firing missiles.
Missiles detonated prior to impact.
Target remains intact, Sir.
It looks like it's being protected by a shield.
Defensive capabilities must have been added.
Okay... now what?
Shields are holding.
Recommend firing a warning shot.
We have been attacked, Commander.
We must respond in kind.
Target the ship.
The Earth vessel has been targeted.
Weapon's primed and ready.
Fire.
Evasive maneuvers, full military thrust.
- Return fire with forward rail guns.
- Sub light engines aren't responding.
Weapons are down!
We've lost hull integrity and life support on decks 3 through 7.
Seal them off!
- That blast cut through our shields at full strength.
- I know, I don't understand how.
- Sensors detect that the weapon is recharging!
- We've only got minutes.
- Hyperdrive status?
- Hyperdrive is offline.
Hull integrity is too unstable.
Medical teams reporting four casualties, eight crew members still unaccounted for.
That thing can only fire at one target at a time.
Go.
Scramble Blue Squadron.
We'll see if we can do some damage in close.
Go, go!
Tracking multiple smaller ships attacking the satellite.
The shield is holding.
By the grace of the gods.
Thirty seconds till weapon is primed and ready.
Target the large vessel again.
It's no use, Blue Leader.
We're not getting through.
Keep at it, boys.
Lieutenant, I need sublight engines now.
I'm trying, Sir.
Auxiliary systems aren't kicking in.
- They can't.
The two main power relays have been damaged.
- Can it be repaired?
We need to re-route power through the bypass conduits.
Here.
We should get limited sublight capability back.
Marks, you're with colonel Carter.
Go.
We need to get up two levels.
Captain!
The elevator's not safe!
Right... sorry...
I don't know what I was thinking.
Shields?
Forward shields at 40%.
Divert all shield power to forward generators.
Sir, sensors indicate that the weapon is reaching maximum power.
All hands, brace for impact!
This damn thing's shield is not weakening.
I got you.
- Are you alright?
- My arm...
Bridge, this is Carter.
Can you beam us up to auxiliary control room two?
Negative, Colonel, control room no longer has life support.
The large vessel appears to be disabled.
Shall I broadcast a call for surrender?
The book of Origin tells us that enemies of the Ori show no mercy in their attempts to draw us away from the path.
We must face this attack with all the strength we have been given.
Finish them.
Prometheus, this is Blue Leader.
Request status report.
Not too good right now, Blue Leader.
Can we assist?
Negative, Blue Leader, negative.
Docking bays are too unstable for safe return.
Stand by for orders.
Roger that.
Bridge, this is Carter.
We need deck 15 unsealed.
Unseal it, if you can.
If the aft power control panel is still intact, we should be able to rig the naquadah generator and re-route power to sublight propulsion.
You've got about two minutes, Colonel.
It's not enough time, Sir.
- Open a channel, broadcast on all frequencies.
- Yes, Sir.
This is Colonel Lionel Pendergast of the Earth Vessel Prometheus calling the Rand Protectorate.
Your attack on our vessel has severely damaged our engines and rendered our weapons systems inoperable.
We are willing negotiate the terms of our surrender.
Rand Protectorate, this is the Earth vessel Prometheus.
We wish to negotiate our surrender.
Repeat, we wish to negotiate our surrender.
- Okay, fire it up.
- Don't we need to test the power flow?
- No time.
- But...
I know!
Do it.
Alright, this is useless.
Blue Squadron, this is Blue Leader.
Break off the attack and scramble formation between the Prometheus and the weapon.
Maybe one of us will get lucky and take a portion of the next shot.
I would not consider that lucky, Colonel Mitchell.
Well, it could be for anybody aboard Prometheus.
This is President Nadal of the Rand Protectorate addressing the Earth vessel.
Please explain your brazen act of aggression against our nation.
Our actions have been misconstrued as hostile.
We are here to investigate why an emissary we sent to your planet,
Dr. Daniel Jackson, has ceased all communications with us.
And yet your first act upon entering our planet's space was to fire on our defense satellite.
But we detected that your satellite was powering up and aiming at us, which we took to be the first act of aggression.
We merely responded in kind.
Now... we are no longer a threat to you.
I have people aboard this vessel who are in need of medical attention, and I am venting atmosphere.
Please, consider our request for surrender.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Your planet sent this ship to attack us.
I have no desire to take more lives.
You tell us what we want to know,
I will accept their surrender.
Who else was involved in this attack?
What other actions are the Caledonians planning?
We're not spies.
I came here to convince your people to dismantle this weapon yourselves before any of this became necessary.
Why would we do that?
I have tried to explain.
Who helped you gain access to the Stargate?
I acted alone.
You are lying.
You are part of a spy network helping to supply the Caledonians with classified information.
Did you ever think that maybe the Caledonians are being leaked information
- because not everyone in your country agrees with what you're doing?
- The weapon is charged.
Wait!
Please.
Just listen to me before you go murdering defenseless people.
We are the ones defending ourselves.
Your ship attacked us.
Sensors detect the weapon is fully charged.
- Colonel Carter, I need good news now.
- A couple of more minutes.
We don't have it, Sam.
I'm sorry.
It's over.
Give me as much power as you can.
Re-route it from the shields and get me all functioning internal Asgard beam sensors back online.
- Sir?
- We're abandoning ship.
Begin the evacuation orders.
I want all personnel to beam down to the planet's surface.
Find me a nice open field anywhere in Caledonia.
Yes, Sir.
And broadcast the locations of all the active sensor sites.
This is the Prometheus to all F-302's.
We have begun our evacuation.
I advise you to get clear of the ship and meet us at the rendezvous coordinates on the planet.
Affirmative, Prometheus.
I'll handle the final transport commands.
Everyone else is to report to the nearest beam-out site.
Let's go, people!
That's an order.
Move!
- Sir, I...
- Get out of here.
Get out of here!
Go.
If I don't finish tying this in, we'll run out of power before everyone can be beamed off.
Go.
We must not fail the gods.
We must embrace our destiny.
- Fire the weapon.
- Wait!
- No!
Ah hell...
The Earth vessel has been destroyed.
The loss of your people is regrettable, but your planet and the Caledonians must know our resolve.
You know full well the Caledonians would rather sacrifice themselves than submit.
You'll be forced to commit genocide and destroy them.
A year ago, they launched a first strike against us.
They obviously had no problem with doing the same.
When does it stop?
When do we stop killing each other over wars started by our fathers and their fathers before them?
This is no longer about Rand or Caledonia.
It is.
We need to set aside our differences and fight the threat of the Ori together.
Goran, how long have we known each other?
Please... believe what Dr. Jackson has told you about them.
With my own eyes,
I saw the Prior bring the satellite to life merely by touching it with his staff.
Neither Rand nor Caledonia have the technology capable of resisting such power.
What choice do we have?
Look...
I can't make you any promises, but we have already developed a machine that neutralizes the Priors' powers.
Now, as far as we know, they've only been able to travel within our galaxy by use of the Stargate, and you can either bury your Gate, or we can teach you to build an iris system like ours.
Nadal has lost all sense of reason.
The book of Origin is just one big lie meant to seduce us into meaningless worship.
The Ori just want to use us, and killing in their name is not self-defense.
It's murder.
.
We were monitoring the entire exchange.
To our knowledge, 76 crew were recovered in Caledonian territory.
There were over 115 people aboard that ship.
Do you have any sort of a manifest, a list of names we can compare to those recovered?
Not on me, no.
So where are our people?
The transport arrived moments ago.
Teal'c, Cameron.
Sam!
You are a sight for sore eyes.
It is good to see you alive, Colonel Carter.
We feared the worst.
Where's Pendergast?
He wasn't with us.
Our security forces did extensive sweeps of the area where you appeared.
No other survivors were found.
This is Minister Chaska, leader of the Caledonian Federation.
I am thankful you survived such a tragic event, Colonel.
I hope we can offer you and your crew some comfort here.
She's pretty much up to speed on what's going on.
We were, of course, praying for your success, but with the destruction of your vessel, I fear that any hope for a peaceful solution to this crisis has been lost.
And you will not surrender?
Our people would rather die than live under Rand rule.
We will retaliate against any attack with the full forces at our disposal.
Any word?
Nothing.
The Rand government continues to deny any knowledge of Daniel Jackson's existence.
Our contacts tell us he was seen alive in the Rand command bunker during the exchange with your ship.
He has not been seen since.
Any progress here?
Well, these satellite schematics are far more detailed than the ones Kane provided.
As we saw firsthand, shields were added late in the design process.
I'm still not sure what's powering it or how it was able to penetrate our Asgard design shields, but there is one bit of good news.
According to this, all commands for the satellite originate from Rand's main control facility, and maintaining a shield around the satellite is a huge power drain, so it's only activated when a threat is detected.
Are you saying the Prometheus was destroyed because we hesitated to fire when we dropped out of hyperspace?
We hesitated out of concern for the safe return of Daniel Jackson.
We also hesitated to leave once our weapons were ineffective.
However, it seems that you are saying if we were to destroy the Rand control facility, the weapon itself would become vulnerable to attack.
Then we could take a 302 back up there and finish the job.
No, the Rand facility is part of an underground bunker complex that was strong enough to survive our last missile attack.
Since then, Rand has developed an early-warning radar system and anti-missile defenses.
Wait up.
What about sabotage?
You said you had people on the inside.
Our agents have already made several attempts.
Security is too tight for them to mount any sort of effective strike.
Actually, we don't have to hit the bunker itself to knock out satellite control.
If we can sever the link between the facility and the weapon, even temporarily...
You're talking about an E.M. Pulse.
Even a small one detonated in the atmosphere above the facility should interfere with their ability to control the satellite.
E.M. Pulse?
It would disable their electronic devices.
They'd be totally blind.
For a short time.
You possess such technology?
You wouldn't have suggested it if you didn't have something in mind.
Well, like most discoveries, it was a bit of an accident.
After the battle with Anubis' fleet over Antarctica, small random E.M. fields were detected by Prometheus during the cleanup.
It took us a while to figure out.
Are you going to tell me that an F-302 gives off an E.M. Pulse when it blows up?
It was one of the things I was working on at area 51.
We think it has something to do with a concussive force interfering with the artificial gravity field generated by the inertial dampeners.
So how do we remote-fly a 302 over there and blow it up?
We don't have to.
All we have to do is harvest the inertial dampener and rig it to one of the Caledonian missiles.
What about their anti-missile defenses?
We can use that same 302's radar-jamming technology to make your missile invisible to Rand.
Still, if this does not work as you are planning, it will be seen as an offensive against Rand.
President Nadal will surely respond by stepping up the deadline for our surrender, and he'll use the satellite weapon against us.
This will work.
I don't know what to say... how to take it all back.
I shouldn't have come to you.
Look, right now, I just have to believe there are survivors.
You think that's really possible?
The Prometheus has beaming technology.
Had... beaming technology, whatever that is.
Look, the bottom line is, we can't lose focus of why we came back here in the first place.
There has to be a way out of this and
I got the feeling Pernaux was listening to us.
Daniel...
I know the history between Caledonia and Rand makes things seem impossible, but sometimes, an outside perspective helps.
In the past, I've found the key to these types of disputes is to... to get both parties on equal footing, just to get the process of talking with each other going again.
Do you ever give up?
Not until I'm dead.
And sometimes, not even then.
Intelligence is reporting visual confirmation of a missile launch from Caledonia.
Early-warning systems detect no missile entering our airspace.
- One missile?
- So it seems.
Possibly a test, then?
They are not going to surrender.
They are preparing to launch a preemptive first strike given the Earth attack on the satellite has failed.
You don't know that.
They still have two days until the deadline.
Get me Minister Chaska.
President Nadal is on line for you, Ma'am.
Doesn't look like they've employed countermeasures.
The radar jamming is working.
The timing is too coincidental.
I suspect he has spies who witnessed the launch.
You need to stall, or else they'll activate the satellite shield out of sheer paranoia.
Patch him through.
President Nadal, this is Minister Chaska.
Mr. President, if you are calling about the recent missile launch, please forgive me.
I should have called you immediately.
The launch was entirely accidental.
It seems there was some confusion when new launch protocol codes were distributed recently.
Obviously, the payload was detonated as soon as we realized what had happened.
Needless to say, everyone here is a little on edge as of late, but, thankfully, we have ample precautions in place to prevent such an occurrence from being a serious threat.
Indeed.
Minister Chaska, while your military's incompetence does concern me, the reason I am calling is to discuss the impending deadline.
I see.
Our government is still in the process of debating its options.
As promised, we will give you an answer by the designated deadline.
I am sorry the decision has not been easier for you.
We shall talk again soon.
Air command, this is Blue Leader.
We are wheels up.
Roger that.
Package is on its way.
We are 30 seconds from detonation over target.
Nice job.
He didn't believe a word of it.
We're getting a report from coastal monitoring base four.
May be visual of an incoming missile.
Why isn't it showing up on our radar?
Sir, satellite sensors are detecting a single small ship on approach.
Possibly one of the Earth fighters that landed in Caledonia.
Activate the missile shields.
What just happened?
I don't know.
We've lost power.
All systems are down.
Backup power is supposed to be isolated.
The systems that activate it are down.
We can't control the satellite.
Get it back!
Get me a radio and a phone in here that works.
Blue Leader, this is base.
The package has been delivered.
Window of opportunity is now open.
Roger that.
We have cleared the atmosphere.
Two minutes from weapons range.
The blast did no apparent damage beyond the power outage, which seems to be limited to the area immediately around the command facility.
To our knowledge, the Caledonians do not possess the level of technology required to do this.
Such a weapon could only have been given to them by your people.
I hope so.
How do we undo this?
You tell me now, or I'll have you executed!
Based on its speed and trajectory, the Earth ship will reach the satellite in less than one minute.
Do you think if the Ori were true gods, they would allow the Caledonians to do this?
Look, I understand your fear of the Prior and why you feel you have no choice, but there is another way out of this.
What would you have me do?
Let me use the radio.
I can contact the ship that's about to destroy the satellite and get them to call it off.
Why would you do this?
Because I still believe a peaceful compromise can be reached out of all this.
I'm listening.
This is Daniel Jackson.
Come in, please.
Whoever's flying the 302, if you can hear me, please respond.
This is Daniel Jackson.
Come in, please.
Jackson, go ahead.
Mitchell?
Yeah.
You okay?
For the moment.
You?
Well, all things considered...
Listen, me and Teal'c are getting ready to bag ourselves an evil Ori satellite.
Yeah, so glad I caught you.
Listen, the Rand want to offer the Caledonians a deal.
Really?
May I?
Please.
Daniel, this is Sam.
Hey, Sam, good to hear your voice.
Yours too.
I'm here with Minister Chaska of the Caledonian Federation.
We'd like to know what Rand is offering.
In exchange for leaving the satellite intact,
Rand is offering Caledonia the Stargate.
Rand is offering the Gate and a limited cease-fire, so all those from Caledonia who do not want to follow Origin and wish to seek refuge on another planet may do so.
They want us to leave our home... our planet.
Jackson, are you sure about this?
I've got a clean shot at this thing, and I am in favor of taking it.
Listen, the Rand built that satellite in less than a year, and I can tell you their resolve is... pretty steady.
If we blow this one up, they're just going to build another, and as far as the Caledonians go, well...
Sam, you'll just have to explain to them that the Priors may not give them much choice, regardless of what Rand decides to do.
I've seen the Priors wipe out entire planets for refusing to follow the Ori.
You will not fight them with us?
Well, we would try, but, honestly, there's only so much we can do.
Will the Prior not follow us wherever we go?
Maybe, but for now...
Look, this offer's not going to be on the table long, and
I realize there's a lot to be worked out, but at least it's a start.
At the very least, the Rand now believe that you have the ability to disable the satellite whenever you want.
Which they will surely counter in time.
Tell colonel Mitchell to call it off.
Blue Leader, this is Carter.
Minister Chaska is requesting that you stand down.
Alright, Jackson, but you folks had better be damn sure about this.
Backup power is online.
Satellite control has been re-established.
Sensors detect the Earth ship is veering away from the target.
Activate the shields.
The ship is no longer a threat.
Power the weapon.
What?
Target the Caledonian capital building.
Sir, perhaps we should take a moment...
You will abide by my authority.
- Power the weapon now!
- Powering the weapon.
Our sensors detect the weapon's shields have become active.
Jackson, what's going on down there?
The satellite is powering up its weapon and targeting the planet.
We had a deal.
President Nadal, explain your actions immediately.
President Nadal!
You gave your word!
I gave my soul to the Ori who offered us all salvation.
Anyone who rejects that is a fool!
They are all Caledonians, for God's sake!
They all deserved to die long before the Prior showed us the path to enlightenment.
Shut down the satellite.
Don't listen to him.
Now!
Arrest the commander.
Stand down!
I won't let you do this, Nadal.
Do as I say!
Put your weapons down!
Now!
Get a medical unit in here.
Go!
Go!
Shut down the satellite.
He's dead.
You heard him the President is dead.
Commander Pernaux is next in command.
- He's also the one who killed the President.
- The President violated an international treaty.
You want to be the one responsible for destroying a city full of people when this goes to tribunal?
Shut it down now!
Hang on.
Help is coming.
The deal... will stand.
Hey.
Haven't seen you since the memorial service.
Yeah.
It was a rough day.
So, where have you been?
I... hand-delivered Landry's letter to colonel Pendergast's wife and kids.
They need to know that he died saving his crew... that his death mattered.
Well, 76 people survived.
That's a testament to his leadership.
And yours.
We never would've got off that planet if you hadn't brokered the deal.
So, I take it, then, you haven't heard.
Heard what?
Soon after we left, the talks broke down.
And?
And we've been unable to make contact with them.
General Landry had the Daedalus re-route on its way back from Atlantis.
It seems the Caledonians weren't content to just leave their fair planet.
They launched an attack.
And Rand responded.
The Stargate is presumed buried in the rubble.
Rough day.
Rough day.
Okay.
Who the hell are you?
Call me Mr. Chips.
That's Tibbs.
Mr. Tibbs.
Jag off.
I've got the gun.
I'm whoever I want to be.
What do you want?
I have the silly idea of combining my two favorite things.
What's that?
Gay sex and suicide?
(GRUNTS)
That one hurt, huh?
No more in the face.
No, I was thinking more like kidnapping and robbery.
Yeah?
You might as well kill me now, then, because you're not going to make a dime out of me.
That's quite a bit of bravado, Mr. Deline.
But I have no intention of killing you.
That's funny, because I have every intention of killing you.
I do, however, have no problem at all killing your daughter.
Daddy!
Delinda!
You're dead.
You're dead!
No!
Daddy, help me!
It's all right, honey.
I'm here!
The death of a daughter is like a needle in the heart, ain't it?
You're gonna wish that you were never born.
Wow.
That was just like out of a movie.
Goosebumps.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
As you've now come to understand, Ed, this sandy grave was not prepared for you, but rather for your daughter.
And by the way, Delinda Deline?
Ridiculous name.
Ridiculous.
What do you want?
What do I want?
I want world peace,
I want fair elections, penis reduction.
But I'd settle for you stealing $50 million from the casino for me.
(DELINDA YELLING)
Daddy!
Let her go and I'll help you.
Rob your casino or she dies.
What do you say, Ed?
Daddy!
No!
No!
No!
It's gonna be okay, honey.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Daddy!
Daddy!
You don't have to put her in a box, do you?
Daddy!
You're a son of a bitch.
So brave.
Now, Ed, your daughter's gonna have to calm down or it's going to end very badly for her.
Honey, you're gonna have to stop fighting now.
Daddy, help me.
Honey, just do what they say, all right?
You have 12 hours to steal $50 million in nonsequential bills from the Montecito.
It's not enough time.
Well, it has to be.
See, that's the exact amount of air I'm putting in the casket for your daughter to breathe.
Daddy, please!
I know.
Nice touch, right?
Now, the money cannot be traceable.
So if any dye packs or electronic devices are detected on the money,
Delinda will die.
Understood.
For your daughter's security, and, for that matter, mine, you cannot tell anyone what you're doing.
You will be watched and monitored at all times.
What do I tell my people?
A bedtime story?
One word about any of this, and Delinda dies.
Seriously, did you choose her name, or did your wife?
Why don't you go to hell?
In time, Ed, in time.
Now, your anklet has a GPS monitor in it, and also an audio transmitter that will relay any and all conversations you have.
It's also packed with enough high-density C-4 to blow your legs clear off your body.
If at any time you fail to comply with our plans, the explosives will be detonated and your daughter killed.
Are we clear?
Yeah.
Good.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
You'll be all right, honey.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
No!
No!
No!
Daddy!
"Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
"Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
"Oh, that she may live like some green laurel
"Rooted in one dear perpetual place."
That's from Yeats.
Apropos, don't you think?
I swear on my mother, somehow, I will kill you.
(SCREAMING)
Any questions?
(DELINDA SHOUTING) When do I get my daughter back?
After I get my money, you'll be given the location of this grave and the code to disarm the explosives on the coffin.
In the coffin, you will find a key that will unlock your electronic anklet.
Okay, she's in.
DELINDA:
Please, someone help me!
Please!
(BEEPING)
Now all we need is someone to bury her.
You'd better kill us both.
Oh, I'd like to.
(FIRES)
But I need you.
Bury her.
Throw him in the trunk.
Please!
Somebody help me!
Daddy!
Nice shirt.
It was a gift.
Give it back.
You must love her very much.
Who?
Whoever bought you that shirt.
(PHONE BEEPS)
(ON ANSWERING MACHINE) Hi, it's Delinda, leave a message.
Hey, hey, Delinda, sweetie.
Where are you?
Call me.
MIKE:
Danny.
Hey.
Have you seen Delinda?
What?
Have you seen Delinda?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over that shirt.
No, seriously, it looks like a donkey and a rodeo clown and then a shotgun.
Pow!
Look, dude, Delinda gave it to me.
Yo, she got to be crazy freaky in bed.
That's just not necessary.
(LAUGHING) Sorry.
I'm a little worried about her.
I woke up this morning and she wasn't there.
She worked the late shift last night.
Maybe she went to work out.
Then she would have called.
Yeah.
She would have called.
I'll look around for her, all right?
Mr. Turner, Mr. Hammond, welcome to the Montecito.
I'm Sam, your casino host.
Call me Sid.
Sid.
Yes.
Willy Hammond.
Hi, Willy.
Millionaire.
Listen, seeing as this is your first visit to the Montecito, we just need to verify some account information with your respective banks.
It's pretty common practice.
We brought cash.
Cash?
Cash.
Two million each.
Two million?
Each.
Hi.
Okay.
We will hold that cash here at our casino cage and credit your accounts accordingly.
What type of business are you two in?
We're not in any business at all.
(LAUGHING)
No, no, no, there's no business.
We won the Pennsylvania State Lottery.
Yeah, me and Willy here split 20 bucks on some tickets and we won the whole damn thing.
Oh!
BOTH: $43.7 million!
(BOTH GUFFAWING)
(SCREAMS)
This is going to be a long weekend.
I beg your pardon?
I said, this is going to be an amazing weekend!
Yeah!
I've arranged for two of the Montecito's finest suites for your stays.
Oh, great.
We're going to need two rooms together.
Yeah, right next to each other.
Okay, well, I did...
You might want to make that happen or else we're leaving.
With our cash.
Next to each other it is.
I got to run.
Hey, Ed!
So...
You look awful.
Nice to see you, too.
What happened?
Oh, I fell down at the house.
No big deal.
I'm fine.
What do you think?
Go ahead, take your shot.
It's nice.
It's nice?
You don't think it's a little much?
What the hell do I know about shirts, you know?
Look, I got a really busy day today, so I need you to hold down the fort, okay?
Okay.
All right.
Have you seen Delinda?
She didn't come home last night and she's not answering her cell phone.
I forgot to tell you that she's...
She's with her sister.
Nessa?
Nessa.
Nessa's here in town?
Do I stutter?
Don't worry about it.
Delinda's gonna call you later, all right?
I haven't seen Nessa in forever.
I'm worried.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, do me a favor, I don't want to be bothered, okay?
Huh?
Okay.
Hey, boss, how you doing?
Hey, it's not a good time, Mary.
There never seems to be a good time to tell you what I'm thinking so I'm just gonna go for it.
Ed, I need to be more integral in the hotel's development and operations.
Great.
Now, with that in mind, I have a plan to boost the profile of the Montecito while improving our customer relations.
Okay.
Montecito needs a mascot.
Right.
You see, a popular mascot can be a source of corporate identity.
And, you know, statistics, they bear out everything that I'm saying to you.
Restaurants that introduce mascots increase food and beverage sales as much as 17%.
Sounds great.
Really?
You like my idea?
I do.
Yeah.
Just go for it.
Thank you, Ed.
Okay.
You won't be sorry.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Six, please.
You really think this place needs a mascot?
Ten hours and counting, Eddie.
Temper, temper, Eddie!
You might want to remind yourself what this is all about.
Huh?
It's a pity, isn't it?
So far you've done a good job with your security counterparts, and throwing them off the trail.
(BELL DINGS) Stay focused, Eddie.
This is me.
This'll be over soon.
Remember, Eddie, we're watching you.
Always watching.
(GRUNTING)
DANNY:
Jillian?
Hi, Danny.
Good news about Nessa, huh?
Nessa?
What are you talking about?
Ed just told me that Nessa's in town and that she's with Delinda.
Why would Ed tell you that?
So, she's not in town?
Danny, I would know if the daughter I haven't seen for two years was here.
Yeah, of course you would.
You know what, maybe I just misunderstood him.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
You haven't spoken to Delinda, have you?
No, I got her machine this morning.
Are you two fighting?
No.
No, no, not that I know of, anyway.
(LAUGHS)
I just...
She's not answering her cell phone, so...
I'm sure she just lost it again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Danny?
Honey, I'm sure she's fine, but when you talk to her, let me know, okay?
And I'll do the same.
Okay.
Dave, how much you holding here on the floor?
Give me a second.
Eighteen million.
Thanks.
Sixteen million.
Six mill.
Thanks.
Nine.
Six.
Fifteen.
This is Ed Deline at the Montecito.
Customer number 890087.
Yeah, I need an additional 25 million delivered to the casino.
Tell John it's for me and I need it rushed.
Two hours.
You're ordering more money?
We just got a delivery.
I got a couple of whales coming in, million-dollar players.
Sorry?
Yeah, thank you.
Are you sure we need that?
No, I'm not sure.
That's why I ordered it.
What is this?
Second-guess Saturday?
Okay, here's an idea for you, don't spread yourself too thin, all right, doing both our jobs.
Sorry.
Okay, I was just...
What?
Leaving?
(STAMMERING) No, Ed, I want to know why you lied to me about Nessa.
What, you're checking up on me?
I talked to Jillian.
You don't check up on me.
I am worried about Delinda, okay?
So am I.
(PHONE RINGS)
Yeah.
CHIPS:
Be very careful here, Ed.
Now, get rid of him and get me my money.
Right.
I want you on the floor.
Okay.
If you need anything, just...
I know.
I really need you to leave now.
Hey, Sam, these rooms are great.
(SAM LAUGHING)
I am so glad you like them.
Now listen, if there is anything I can do to make your stay more enjoyable, you don't hesitate to ask, all right?
Hey, now, the whole hotel is open to us?
Yeah, of course.
The high-stakes parlor is located on the main casino floor, now...
Wait.
We can't gamble, though, until the game is finished.
What game?
Hide and seek.
When you say "hide and seek," you don't mean...
Yeah.
Yeah, like the kids' game, hide and seek.
Why would you play that?
For money.
Yeah, we put up a million each.
You're playing hide and seek for $2 million?
Exactly.
And the game starts now.
We're going for 12 hours.
Right.
Synchronize watches.
Ready?
Yes.
Okay.
All right?
Yeah.
BOTH:
One, two, three.
Scissors cut paper.
(BOTH LAUGHING) You're it!
Hey, hey, hey, you guys are going to gamble, right?
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Thirty!
If you don't gamble, I can't extend the Montecito's hospitality to you.
Why are your whales running?
Because they can't swim.
They're playing hide and seek.
Right.
How much are they going to play for over the weekend?
Couple million each.
Do you have any other high rollers coming in?
No.
Just Orville and Wilbur.
Why?
Because Ed ordered an extra 25 million to accommodate a guest.
Do you know anything about that?
No, I don't know anything about that.
Okay.
Keep an eye out.
Oh, this is gonna suck.
Danny said you told him that Delinda's with Nessa.
No.
Where is Delinda, Ed?
She told me she went to that spa at Red Rock's.
I guess Danny and her had some kind of fight, and she wanted some of that, what do they call it now? "Private time."
Should I go meet her?
No, no, she'll be fine.
Why didn't she call me?
How should I know?
I mean, she told you, but she didn't tell me, and...
And why would Danny say that you said that?
Again, honey, how should I know?
And I really think that we should stay out of their personal lives.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would she...
Jillian, please.
Fine.
Having a bad day?
Yeah.
I got a lot of stuff going on.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you?
Of course I would.
Okay.
I'll see you at home tonight.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Honey?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Excuse me.
Jodie.
Excuse us for a minute, please?
Yes, Mr. Deline.
Thank you.
Tommy, listen,
I need you to pack 25 million cash for transport, all right?
25 million?
Yeah.
For what?
What do you mean, "for what"?
When do you need it?
I need it right now.
Ed, you know I can't do that.
To pull that kind of cash off the floor,
I got to close down half the casino.
Close down half the casino, okay?
We lose millions if I do that.
Listen, this isn't a freaking debate, Tommy.
Just do what I tell you, all right?
Now, listen, I want the money bound,
I want it wrapped in plastic and put on palates.
I need two signatures to make it...
I'll sign twice.
You know, I can't do it.
I'll lose my job.
Yeah, you're right, Tom.
Hey, Bill.
Yes, sir?
You just got promoted.
You're new cage manager.
Ed?
You're fired, Tommy.
Get out.
Come on, Ed.
I said, get out.
Get out!
You heard.
You understood my request?
Yes, sir. 25 million right away, Mr. Deline.
You ready?
As I'll ever be.
All right, Mike, I present to you the Montecito's new mascot.
Ta-da!
Monty Montecito.
I don't get it.
He's a prospector.
I can see that.
So?
So, what does prospecting have to do with the Montecito?
He will help you mine your fortunes from our casino.
I still don't get it.
Research has shown us that people want to see more forty-niner style prospectors in their casinos.
Research?
The man in the suit has done stints as Mayor McCheese, a Teletubby, and a brief tour as Barney Rubble.
I couldn't be more excited.
And you're sure you cleared this with Ed?
Yeah.
He told me to go for it, so I say we let Monty Montecito show people just how much fun this hotel can be.
Come on, Monty.
Everybody, this is Monty Montecito!
The Montecito has a mascot.
I see that.
I don't get the whole prospector thing.
Not so much.
Do you know that Ed just fired Tommy, the cage manager?
Tommy?
He's been with Ed forever.
He'd never do that.
He just did it.
I just talked to Tommy.
He said that he questioned him about taking 25 million bucks off the floor.
I saw a security manifest sent from the bank.
Ed just ordered an additional 25 million to be brought in.
What the hell's going on, Mike?
Like that damn mascot.
It's not making any sense.
No.
We need to find out what Ed is going to do with 50 million bucks.
Mitch, pull up surveillance footage of Ed today.
You got it.
Thanks.
Who the hell is that?
MIKE:
What's he showing him?
Zoom in.
Can't.
It's blown out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Something is seriously wrong.
Okay.
I think that this has something to do with Delinda because he told me that she's with Nessa.
Nessa?
Yeah.
But she's...
I know.
I think that it was Ed's way of tipping me off.
Mitch, video lQ the guy in the elevator, will you?
MITCH:
There's no matches.
Want me to try some other databases?
No, keep working on it.
There should be some surveillance footage of Delinda.
Delinda?
Yeah.
Look at this.
The guy keeps popping up.
See this?
Look at that.
Here.
Same guy here.
Then again right here.
Hey, show me the entrance from shift change.
She's alone.
There he is again.
Mitch, video lQ this guy, will you?
MITCH:
Here we go.
Russ DeBeers.
He's got a record for felony assault.
What the hell is she doing?
She's getting in the car.
MIKE:
He could have a gun.
No license plate.
Where the hell is she?
(DRILL WHIRRING)
Hey!
Hey!
Hi, Sam.
Hi, what the hell are you doing?
What?
I say, what the hell are you doing?
He's in the shower.
Okay, listen, I need to know when you and Willy plan on gambling.
Soon.
Real soon.
Listen, this is...
I'll pay for it.
No.
Uh-uh!
(WATER TRICKLING)
Okay, I'm sorry.
I can't...
I...
No, no, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
That...
Hey!
Come here!
(SMACKING) WILLY:
Hey!
Ow!
Can I have my shoe back?
Are you going to gamble?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
He's naked.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Which way did he go?
Thataway.
Put some clothes on.
Took you long enough.
It's been three minutes.
And why in the hell would you want to meet in here?
You know brothers can't stand the cold.
They're out there.
Who?
Whoever it is that's watching Ed.
They're tracking his movements, who he's interacting with.
He lied to me.
He tried to take 50 million bucks off the floor, and where the hell is Delinda?
Kidnappers.
So what do we do?
We help him.
Hey, he grabbed my... (BEEPING)
The money is coming in.
Everything's pretty much business as usual.
Great.
Oh, I almost forgot that problem in the casino southeast bathroom.
Yeah?
The problem was in one of the stalls, it's been fixed.
I know you wanted to check it out.
Yeah, when I get a chance.
Okay.
Okay, I'm going back to the floor.
Oh, Danny...
I just want to say thanks, kid.
No problem.
Sid, hi, we need to talk.
In a minute, okay?
So, anyway, we're at the high roller suite.
You should come up for a drink.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah.
And maybe if you had a friend, you know, you could bring her along, and who knows...
Ow!
Hey!
Wait a...
Hey!
(PEOPLE SNICKERING)
Wow.
It's pretty cold in there, huh?
How you doing?
I wish I was dead.
Yeah, I can see why.
You see the mascot I brought in?
No, and I have no desire to see the...
Tough.
Come with me.
I'm not kidding.
I really... (WOMAN LAUGHING)
It's great.
Great!
Cheese.
I don't get it.
He's a prospector.
(EXCLAIMS)
Looks like he struck something.
WOMAN:
Monty, stop that!
Hey!
(TOILET FLUSHES)
Hey, I lost my pants.
I got it.
I got it under control.
WOMAN:
He did not!
MAN:
Seven!
(ALL CHEERING)
Hey!
Yep.
Okay, I'm having a GPS tracking device put under the firewall, detectable only if the bad guys find a frequency.
The helicopter's ready to go on your order.
Okay.
Okay, good.
I want you to oversee hotel security and be the liaison between the fbi once we get Delinda back, okay?
And you are going to get her back.
You bet your ass.
Yeah?
I was asked to deliver this personally to you, Mr. Deline.
Thank you.
(DIALING)
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello, Ed, nice of you to call.
I can do without the pleasantries.
When the money arrives, you will drive it towards Henderson alone.
You will receive further instructions on this cell phone.
Any deviation from this plan will be noncompliance and your daughter dies.
Understood?
Yeah.
Understood.
Look forward to seeing you, Ed.
You have no idea.
MIKE:
Notify Mr. Deline and send guards out to the truck.
Okay.
25 million just arrived at the loading dock.
Okay.
Let's pull the other 25 million off the floor.
Let's close down half the gaming tables, the north and south slot areas and all the high roller pits.
Let's do it.
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop.
What's up, Sam?
I've had enough.
That's what's up.
Okay, you need to either gamble or I'm throwing you out.
What, why didn't you say something?
I can get my gamble on.
I did say it.
Excuse me, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
My man, 500,000 red.
500,000 red.
Place your bets.
And no more bets, please.
36 red!
(ALL EXCLAIMING) Damn!
Yes!
Credit my account.
Nice.
You see?
See you!
Yeah...
No!
Hey, you need to gamble or you're out of here.
Why didn't you just say something?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
500,000, black.
500,000, black.
13.
Winner!
Black 13!
(CROWD CHEERING)
Credit my account!
You really should have golf carts.
You should really have a heart attack.
I need you to shut down blackjack tables 18 through 51.
Does Mr. Deline know about this?
Yes.
Per his orders.
Now.
Now.
(inaudible)
Down this way.
Mr. Deline, I don't have to tell you that this is breaking security protocol.
I'll indemnify you.
Here, you got something for me to sign here?
All right, load the money in the truck, will you?
Yes, sir.
Load it up, guys.
(PEOPLE CHEERING)
Oh!
(LAUGHING)
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
Thirty!
Ah!
Touch me and I will kick your ass.
All right, thanks.
The helicopter's waiting for you on the roof.
Thanks.
Let me know when you get Delinda back and I'll make the call.
Do nothing until I tell you she's safe.
You got it.
Let's go!
(BEEPING)
Keep your distance.
Roger that.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, no, no!
Monty, you're fired.
'Cause you're drunk.
Yes.
You were also fondling guests.
We have a dozen complaints against you.
Sorry, Monty, but we're going to have to let you go.
I'm sorry.
Get up.
No, no, no, come on.
Come on.
You're embarrassing yourself.
You're out of here, pal.
You're out of here.
Come on.
Yeah.
I guess I got to whoop some foam ass.
Yeah.
(GRUNTING)
Get out of here!
And stay out, you foam low life!
Oh.
No, no, no, no, no.
Nicely handled.
You know, it's sad when a mascot loses his way.
Three more seconds and I win $1 million.
Mmm.
And then you will gamble?
Absolutely.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
Who the hell are you?
Four, three, two...
Hey, who the hell is that guy?
Let's go.
(LAUGHING)
I won a million dollars, baby!
(EXCLAIMS)
Thanks for the suit, Sam.
No problem.
Hey, credit my account.
Oh!
No!
This is a do-over.
What?
I'm not paying you.
We said nothing about costumes!
It's not the point.
I would have been a big chipmunk and you know that.
No!
You always do that!
I love to dress up!
Do-over!
It's a do-over!
You could have...
You're ridiculous!
I ain't paying you.
You're sad.
You're a million...
You cheap millionaire!
Get out of the truck.
Hands where I can see them.
Money's in the truck.
All right.
Check the money for dye packs, transmitters, number sequences on the bills.
Where is my daughter?
Patience, Ed, patience.
No patience, pal.
Right now, where is she?
Now.
Money's clean.
Okay, move to the truck.
Let's go!
Okay.
Here's your daughter.
Now, time is running out, so if I were you, I would hurry.
Come on, guys.
Let's go!
Come on!
Step it up!
Oh, hey, Chips... (GRUNTS)
Want me to kill him?
No.
No.
That'll happen soon enough.
Take the keys out of the truck.
Let's go!
Finish up!
Ed, good punch.
(GRUNTING)
Enjoy your walk.
Let's go!
Yeah?
ED:
Danny.
Danny, listen, Delinda's buried.
Did you just say Delinda's buried?
Yeah.
Where?
The coordinates are north 36-04, west, 115-09.
Okay.
Got it.
When you get there, dig up the box, but do not open it.
It's rigged with explosives.
I'll give you the combination.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
We're on our way.
(BEEPING)
My God.
Okay, we're here.
(DEVICE BEEPING)
(RAPID BEEPING)
Right here.
Right here!
Okay.
Give me the combination.
The combination is 7, 11, 12.
7, 11, 12.
Seven...
Come on.
Ed, she's not here.
Delinda's not here!
Son of a bitch.
Danny, I'm not going to make it, kid.
You got to find Delinda and bring her back.
What are you talking about?
There's no time.
Just promise me you'll find her.
Promise me!
Ed!
Ed!
Ed, listen to me!
Ed!
Listen to...
I'll see you, kid.
Ed!
Ed!
Ed, listen to me, there's a can of spray freeze and some bolt cutters under the front seat of your truck!
A can of what?
Spray freeze!
Grab it and spray it on the timer device!
Go!
Okay, now freeze the timer!
Spray the whole can, it'll give you a couple of extra seconds.
Now, cut it off!
Ed, cut it off!
(EXPLOSION)
Ed?
Ed!
Talk to me, Ed!
Ed!
Your father's dead.
To the airfield.
Put on something snappy.
ED:
Danny!
Danny!
Ed?
Ed, is that you?
What the hell?
Were you gonna just leave me out here?
You son of a bitch!
I thought you were dead.
Well, I'm not.
Get your ass over here and pick me up.
We got to go find Delinda.
Okay.
I'm coming!
Did you finally get your hide-and-seeking whales out there?
Oh, yeah.
You bet your ass.
I also got them to leave more than half their money at the craps table.
(GIGGLES)
Hey, why is half the casino still closed?
It's a computer problem at the bank.
We haven't gotten our money shipment yet.
But as soon as they fix it, we'll get everybody up and running.
This place is getting weirder and weirder.
Mike, we have a major problem.
I can't find Danny and Delinda anywhere.
Yeah, they're both not feeling well tonight.
What's the problem?
Well, that's just it.
Most of the staff, they called in sick with the flu.
Really?
Yeah.
And I had to send the ones who wanted work home so they don't get the guests sick.
But the worst part is that we have a high-profile critic coming in from Hotel Traveler Magazine to do a feature on the Montecito with no staff.
First the mascot thing, now this.
Basically, I'm screwed.
And everybody's gonna blame me.
Nobody's gonna blame you.
Of course they'll blame me.
They always blame me.
No.
"Oh, Mary, why can't she do anything right?
"And what does she do here anyway?"
I hear them talking.
Mary, nobody talks about you.
Really?
Why not?
Maybe you're making too much of this.
I'm just going to have to prove to everybody how valuable I am.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hello.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Only two servers showed up at Wolfgang's today and all the customers are complaining.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I got to take this.
Oh, you were a waitress once, right?
No.
You'll be fine.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I'm coming!
MIKE:
Danny, how is she?
We didn't get her back.
She's not...
I can't even think about that.
Listen to me.
I need you to get Jillian down to the Montecito as soon as possible.
Of course.
Where is she?
At home.
Use a full security team and bring her in through the underground garage.
And do not tell anyone, Mike.
Business as usual.
You're in charge.
I'll call you when we land.
Got it.
Looks like he's headed to the Jefferson Airport outside of Henderson.
How did you get a GPS bug on him?
I hope you got a good shot in.
I did.
Let's go get this guy.
If we move now, he'll kill Delinda for sure.
I got to figure a way to shut down that airport.
Got it.
Alan Jeffries in Homeland Security.
I met him at a security seminar.
I hooked his brother's bachelor party up.
Alan!
Danny McCoy.
Great, thanks.
Listen, we have a possible terrorist situation happening down here.
Yes, heavily armed.
Last headed towards the Jefferson Airport outside of Henderson.
Yeah, I need you to shut down that airfield.
Okay, thanks.
I'll call you back.
You know how many laws you just broke?
I don't care.
All I care about is getting Delinda back.
I'm just saying I like the attitude.
You just bought us some time.
Force them into plan B.
What about our plan?
Our plan.
Get my daughter back and kill them all.
(PHONE RINGING)
ROBB:
Yeah.
Okay.
We got a problem.
Tommy caught it on the scanner.
They're shutting down the airfield because of a terrorist threat.
Damn it.
I hope for your sake your boyfriend didn't do anything stupid.
Very ladylike.
(GRUNTS)
Take us back to the warehouse.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Hey, Sam.
Yeah?
We got a guy playing 1,000 a spin on table nine.
He's up about 100 grand.
Is he with you?
100 grand?
Yeah.
Yes, he is with me.
No more bets.
22.
Black 22.
A winner.
35,000, sir.
Hello.
Hey.
Welcome to the Montecito.
I'm Samantha Marquez.
I'm your casino host.
I would like to extend to you all of the luxuries the Montecito has to offer.
Luxury, Miss Marquez, is the freedom not to want.
I need of nothing, but I thank you for your graciousness.
Please, accept this.
You will hold these for me, please?
Of course, sir.
What the hell was that?
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
Can we get a menu?
There you go.
Enjoy your meal.
We didn't order this.
No?
No, we ordered pizzas.
Coming right up.
Mary, soup's up!
Okay.
(BOTH SCREAM)
(GROANING)
Would you like some freshly ground pepper with that?
You're never gonna get away.
If that's the case, why don't I just kill you right now?
Because you need me.
I'm the only chip you got left, Chips.
I got 50 million chips, blondie.
You're just chump change to me.
You're going to die, you know.
They shut down your airport.
It's only a matter of time.
By the time the police figure any of this out,
I'll be on a beach earning 20%.
I'm glad you think this is all funny.
What's so funny is you actually think the police will be involved.
There'll be no police, no fbi.
There'll only be men whose sole responsibility will be to hunt you down and kill you.
All of you.
And they will.
They always do.
Well, then.
Let's just see about that.
Get me Danny McCoy.
(PHONE DIALING)
(PHONE RINGS)
Dan McCoy.
Danny McCoy.
What a pleasure it is to finally speak to you.
So what are you doing, scumbag?
Eddie.
You're a pesky pain in the ass, aren't you?
Let me talk to my daughter.
I don't think that's going to be possible.
(HANGS UP)
(STAMMERS) What'd you do?
He's going to call back.
(SCOFFS)
Seems your father's still alive.
(PHONE DIALING)
(PHONE RINGS)
Yeah?
Daddy?
Honey, are you okay?
Daddy, I'm okay.
Okay, you've spoken to her.
Now, this is what I want.
I want the Montecito jet fueled up and ready to go.
Once we're in the air I'll give the pilot instructions, and then I will give you the whereabouts of your daughter.
Any attempt to try any...
No.
What did you just say to me?
I said no.
Maybe you've forgotten...
You listen to me, scumbag.
The deal was the money for my daughter.
Now if you'd have just given her back, all this crap would have been over.
Now it's my show.
And I'm not letting you leave.
Sucks to be you.
All right.
Here, hold this.
According to this, they're located out near the Alamo mines.
There's a warehouse out where they used to store heavy mining equipment.
It'd be a perfect place to store a few SUVs full of money.
How well do you know it?
It's been a while.
I used to do some shooting out there.
We're going to find out everything we can about it.
Do some shooting again.
Ed?
Ed?
Oh, thank God.
Oh, honey.
Where's our daughter?
She's okay, she's okay.
They've got her there in some warehouse.
So, you've called the police and the fbi?
No, we can't.
What?
We can't.
If you're not going to call them, I will.
No, please, stop.
Let go!
Look at me.
What?
If we call, they will kill her.
No, no.
(SOBBING)
No.
JILLIAN:
No.
It's going to be okay.
Trust me, okay?
(CLEARS THROAT)
I've taken it upon myself to arrange one of our most beautiful suites for you to use during your stay with us.
All of your food and beverages will be comped, and I'm not wearing any panties.
Or a bra.
I'm completely shaven.
Bald.
(SLOT MACHINE DINGS)
Hi, welcome back.
I was just trying to tell you that the generosity of the Montecito for our preferred guests knows no bounds.
Sometimes, when we are generous in small, barely detectable ways, we can change the life of someone else forever.
Hmm.
Wow.
A penny.
Okay.
Mitch, what have you got?
This.
This monk just hit a $20,000 slot jackpot.
And?
And it's his third one tonight.
The odds of that are astronomical.
Plus he's already taken us for 300 grand and some change off the table games.
So, what's his con?
He prays.
Come again?
He prays.
He finds a machine, he prays for a few minutes, he pulls the handle and wins.
That's not possible.
Video lQ him.
Tsuldi Tendar.
Born in Lhasa, Tibet.
He became a monk after studying at the Gadong Monastery.
He makes a pilgrimage to Las Vegas every seven years.
I heard about this guy.
I thought he was just a legend in the Vegas security circle.
Yeah, he comes in and cleans out one casino during his stay.
Does he cheat?
He's got to.
No one's that lucky.
But nobody's been able to catch him.
You want to run him out of here?
No.
Let's keep an eye on him.
If this guy is cheating, I'm going to be the one to catch him.
So, I talked to my guy at Homeland Security.
He said that there's a heavy presence at all the airports and airfields in the area.
No one's going to get out without an inspection.
What about driving?
No.
No way.
I got an APB on three black SUV's.
And I got a scanner, so...
And I don't think they'd take that chance.
I guess they're going to hole up at that warehouse until things start cooling off.
What do you say we take a look ourselves, huh?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Housekeeping!
I can't believe I have to do this.
Get a flu shot, for the love of God.
Hi.
Hi.
Glad you finally came.
I've been calling all morning.
Yeah.
We're a little short-staffed today.
You're the one who spilled soup on me.
Oh, my.
Oh, jeez, I am so sorry about that.
So, what, you wait tables and do housekeeping?
(GASPS) Did you see that?
Oh, no, no, no.
We're just having a little bit of a flu epidemic amongst the staff so I'm just kind of filling in where needed.
Lucky you, huh?
Yeah, lucky...
Lucky me.
If you don't mind, I got to do my workout.
Oh, please.
By all means, knock yourself out.
The gym's on the second floor.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)
MAN:
Congratulations.
He's not counting.
And he's not past-posting or catching the hole card.
How much is he up now?
Over 800 grand.
Keep him here.
Do anything you have to, but I do not want him walking out of here with our money.
Do monks like hookers?
I don't know about monks, but I do.
Keep him here.
Hey.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you enjoying your stay thus far?
The time I have spent here has filled my heart with peace and understanding.
Oh.
I see it's also filled your robe there with 50s and 100s, huh?
What is it you are searching for, Sam?
Me?
Nothing.
I've got everything I need.
Why would you ask me something like that?
'Cause I'm totally fine.
I'm great, in fact.
Totally.
I'm fine.
You suffer.
Oh, no, no.
I don't suffer.
Mmm-mmm.
Suffer from what?
When you are suffering, you should examine whether you can do anything about it.
If you can, there is no need to worry.
If you cannot, there is also no need to worry.
I have found this most enjoyable.
Thank you.
I don't suffer.
I'm suffering from these crazy conversations.
That's what I'm suffering from.
I don't suffer.
Shut up.
All right, there she is.
Northwest corner.
One, two, three...
Four inside, three outside.
Let me see.
I got to buy some more time.
We got to get these son of a bitches at night.
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone.
(PHONE RINGING)
It's Daddy.
Not a word.
Montecito Savings and Loan, how can I direct your call?
ED:
Okay, pal, you win.
I'm sorry?
I don't think I heard you correctly.
Look, I said, you win.
I'm so happy you finally came to your senses, Ed.
Now, what did you have in mind?
The Montecito jet, take you, your men, the money anywhere you want to go.
No, no.
The airports, Ed, they're all on high security thanks to you.
They'll never let the plane leave.
It will if I'm with you.
You let Delinda go and take me.
And I'll clear everything up at the airport, all right?
Very well.
I'll call you with the time and place where we're going to make our little exchange.
It's got to be face to face.
Now, what good is that going to do, Ed?
I got to know that Delinda's alive.
You already talked to her.
No, that could have been recorded.
I got to see her.
Okay.
All right.
I'll let you know.
I'll give you a call.
No, I'll call you.
What are you, crazy?
It's the only way, Danny boy.
It's the only way.
Boys,
Grand Cayman, here we come.
(ALL CHEERING)
All right!
(CHATTERING)
Hey.
Hey.
Do you think I suffer?
Suffer?
Suffer how?
Suffer, like, do you think I'm a happy person?
No.
"No"?
What do you mean, "no"?
Of course I'm a happy person.
I'm very happy.
I'm so comfortable with my happiness that I don't even need to explain to you how happy I am.
Okay, you're happy.
You really don't think I'm happy?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What the hell is wrong with you?
What?
I think you're the one who's not happy.
Yeah, yeah, see?
Yeah.
You've got problems.
(SLOT MACHINE DINGING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
That's enough of that.
Sir, hotel security.
May I talk with you for a moment?
I listen to all things in the universe with an open heart.
Yeah, right.
Please come with me, sir.
(EXCLAIMING in DISAPPOINTMENT)
Hi there.
I'm Mary.
Our massage therapist called in sick, so I'll be taking care of you today.
Okay.
Mmm.
(STAMMERING) Just let me know if it's hard...
Getting hard.
If I'm rubbing too...
Just let me know.
Let me know.
Mmm.
How's that?
That's perfect.
(GROANING)
Ow.
Okay, sorry.
Hey!
Hey!
Yeah.
Ow!
I got to tell you I'm quite impressed.
Yeah.
I've never met anyone who can get under Sam's skin the way you did.
But the only thing I want to know is, how have you been cheating?
Cheating?
You mean, winning.
No, I mean cheating.
It's a statistical impossibility for you to have won as much as you have.
No one can be that lucky.
Luck does not exist.
Karma.
Karma?
Yes.
You see, if I win a billion dollars one day, it may be the cause for one of my descendents to lose a billion dollars in 1,000 years.
Things come and they go.
We can never tell when the results of things done long ago may come leaking out.
Mmm.
So, you're trying to tell me that karma is the reason why you're up $1.2 million in our casino?
It is through karma that one's destiny unfolds.
I'm sorry.
You are no longer welcome in this casino.
I understand.
Your heart is noble.
You should follow it more often.
I thank you for your generosity.
How about a smile?
Bite me.
Oh, is that an offer?
You couldn't get it up if you wanted to.
Oh, feisty.
Just like your old man.
I like that.
Yeah, yeah, work with me.
That's it.
Fight it.
Yeah, good.
Work with me.
Yeah, now flip the hair.
Yes.
You're a caged animal.
(LAUGHS)
Good.
(BEEPS)
I think we got it.
You know, you're very photogenic.
Ever consider modeling?
(WHISPERING)
Ow!
Okay.
Okay.
Ow!
Sorry.
Jeez!
Stay still.
Stay still.
(GROANING)
Okay.
Okay, that's it!
All done.
All done.
All done.
Ah!
How's it look?
Great.
Unnoticeable.
You.
What, did my ex-wife hire you to destroy my weekend?
No, I just...
Everybody's sick, and I'm just...
I'm trying to help out.
Well, you're not.
You want that?
Hey!
Hey.
You told him to leave?
My monk.
Oh, now he's your monk?
Yes, he is my monk.
You can't let him leave here with over a million of our dollars.
Would you rather he bust the place out?
He's a cheat, Sam.
And Ed will have both of our heads on a stake if we don't do something.
He's gone.
I have an idea about how to get the money back.
Let's just cut our losses while we're only a million behind.
Mmm-mmm.
I can't lose to this guy and neither can you.
Come on, man up!
Fine, fine, fine.
But it's on you when Ed finds out the Montecito has been turned into a damn monastery.
Okay.
It's on me.
I don't think this is a good idea, Ed.
It's the only way, honey.
You ready to do this?
Yeah.
Make the phone call.
CHIPS:
Yeah?
Yeah.
Dry Desert Road, half a mile past the old post office.
8:00.
Be alone.
Be careful.
Yes, ma'am.
Bring her home.
I promise.
Let's go, pal.
Boys, all right, the meeting's been set.
Junkyard off of Dry Desert Road, 8:00.
Now, he's expecting me to come alone so, Mark, Robb, you need to get there an hour before us.
Position yourselves here and here.
I'll keep him out in the open and you can kill him here.
No!
Oh, shut up.
I thought we needed Deline to get on the plane.
He'd never let us leave.
But once he's dead, a mother forced with the decision of letting us go, or the death of her child.
Well, there's really no choice, is there?
(lMITATES AIRPLANE TAKING OFF)
We're going!
Oh.
So cute.
ED:
We all set?
Yeah.
I'm going to be about 100 yards from the warehouse.
I want you to call me the minute you leave Chips, okay?
Here, take this.
No, I got one.
Grenade?
No, I'm good.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Thanks, Rambo.
Hey, listen, if something happens to me, you make sure you get her out of there, you hear me?
Yes, sir.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
(FEEDING BACK)
Sorry!
Sorry!
That was...
That was bad.
(PEOPLE PROTESTING)
(UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING)
Hello.
You're everywhere.
Yeah.
Would you like to dance?
Yes, I would.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Please do come in, Sam.
I have a proposition for you.
Oh, propositions can be very tricky things, especially when they entice the heart from the soul.
What is it that you ask of me?
How would you like to make one last bet?
But I have been asked to leave the premises.
What if you didn't have to leave?
What if you could stay?
Would you make one last bet?
And why would this one bet be so important to you?
You see, what I do here, my job, is all I really have,
and I've sacrificed everything to get here and I'm afraid if you have to leave, that I may be forced to leave as well.
This job, this work does not define you as a person.
Your heart, kindness and passion is what defines you.
You don't know me very well.
Change happens in immeasurable units, not in grand gestures.
I'd like to change.
Then you shall.
I think I might need a little help.
This proposition, would it ease some of your pain?
Tell me of this bet of yours.
Ed, my friend, so nice to see you again.
Open your jacket.
Come on.
Haven't you learned to trust me by now?
Just open it now.
Okay.
Okay?
Where's my girl?
May I?
Okay.
Jet's fueled up, ready to go.
You bring Delinda to the airport, we'll make the exchange there.
Oh, I don't think that's going to be necessary.
Don't move!
Drop it!
Eddie, a bye-bye.
Kill him.
(GUN FIRING)
(SCREAMS)
(AIR HISSING)
What the hell are you doing here?
Did you really think I wasn't going to come?
Yeah, I did.
Listen, get out of here.
Go get Delinda.
Get her out of there.
DANNY:
What about you?
I'll meet you.
(GROANING)
My arm!
(BONE CRACKING)
(SCREAMING)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
What?
Are you out of your mind?
One bet, double or nothing?
You'd rather have him walk out of here with a $1 million of our money?
MIKE:
One instead of two.
Yes.
Gutless.
Yeah.
Okay, one-time million-dollar bet.
Obviously, you can choose black or red.
Of course, the choice is yours.
Eight.
What?
$1 million on number eight.
Excuse us for a moment.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Are you crazy?
If he hits that number, we owe him $35 million.
Thirty-five!
The odds of him hitting that are 2.63%.
That is not gonna happen.
He's been doing it all day, Sam.
He's going to lose.
I know it.
What the hell?
I can always get a job at Jack In The Box.
That's right.
You'd look hot in that paper hat.
Okay.
One million on number eight.
No more bets.
Fourteen.
Fourteen.
The number is 14.
Fourteen.
Why did you do that?
In order to be happy, Sam, one must be willing to let go of everything.
Everything.
Can I see that?
This is a 1943 copper penny.
So?
So, there's only, like, 40 of these still in existence.
This penny's worth about $80,000.
Why'd you give it back to him?
Karma.
I truly am just so sorry about everything.
Oh, it's quite all right.
Actually, I'm impressed at the lengths you go to to take care of your guests.
That's what we do here at the Montecito.
And that's precisely what I'm going to write about.
Write about?
Yeah.
I'm a critic for Hotel Traveler Magazine.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
And despite our few setbacks, my experience here has been a phenomenal one.
And you're going to write that?
Exactly that.
It was a great pleasure meeting you.
Indeed.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey, need a light?
(GRUNTING)
Okay, I... (GRUNTING)
(CLATTERING)
Capture:
FRM@ Sync:
FRM@openext
Okay.
Who the hell are you?
Call me Mr. Chips.
It's Tips.
Mr. Tips, jack-off.
I've got the gun.
I'm whoever I want to be.
What do you want?
Well, I had the silly idea of combining my two favorite things.
And what's that?
Gay sex, suicide?
That one hurt, huh?
No more in the face.
No, I was thinking more like kidnapping and robbery.
Yeah?
Well, you might as well kill me then 'cause, uh, you're not gonna make a dime on me.
That's quite a bit of bravado, Mr. Deline.
But I have no intention of killing you.
Oh, that's funny, 'cause I have every intention of killing you.
I do, however, have no problem at all killing your daughter.
-Daddy!
-Delinda--
You're dead!
You're dead!
Daddy, help me!
It's all right, honey, I'm here.
Death of a daughter is like a needle to the heart, ain't it?
Daddy!
You're gonna wish that you were never born.
Wow.
That was just like out of a movie.
Goosebumps.
Daddy!
Daddy!
As you've now come to understand, Ed, this sandy grave was not prepared for you, but rather, for your daughter.
And by the way...
Delinda Deline?
Ridiculous name.
Ridiculous.
What do you want?
What do I want?
I want world peace.
I want fair elections.
Penis reduction.
But I'd settle for you stealing
$50 million from the casino for me.
No!
No!
Daddy!
Let her go, and I'll help you.
Rob your casino, or she dies.
What do you say, Ed?
Daddy!
No!
No!
No!
This'll be okay, honey.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Daddy!
Daddy!
You don't have to put her in a box do ya?
Daddy!
Son of a bitch.
So brave.
Now, Ed, your daughter's gonna have to calm down, or it's gonna end very badly for her.
Honey, you're gonna have to stop fightin'.
Daddy, help me.
Honey, just do what they say, all right?
You have 12 hours to steal $50 million in consequential bills from the Montecito.
That's not enough time.
Well, it has to be.
See, that's the exact amount of air
I'm putting in the casket for your daughter to breathe.
Daddy, please--
I know.
Nice touch, right?
Now, the money cannot be traceable.
So if any dye packs or electronic devices are detected on the money,
Delinda will die.
Understood.
For your daughter's security, and for that matter, mine, you may not tell anyone what you're doing.
You'll be watched and monitored at all times.
What do I tell my people?
A bedtime story?
One word about any of this, and Delinda dies.
Seriously, did you choose her name, or did your wife?
Why don't you go to hell?
In time, Ed.
In time.
Now, your ankle-- that has a GPS monitor in it.
And also, an audio transmitter that will relay any and all conversations you have.
It's also packed with enough high-density C-4 to blow your legs clear off your body.
If, at any time, you fail to comply with our plans, the explosives will be detonated, and your daughter killed.
Are we clear?
Yeah.
Good.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
It's gonna be all right, honey.
No!
No!
No!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
No!
No!
No!
Daddy!
[muffled]
"Nor but in merriment begin a chase,
Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
O may she live like some green laurel
Rooted in one dear perpetual place."
That's from Yeats.
Apropos, don't you think?
I swear on my mother... somehow, I will kill you.
Ah!
Daddy!
Any questions?
When do I get my daughter back?
After I get my money you'll be given the location of this grave and the code to disarm the explosives on the coffin.
In the coffin, you'll find a key that will unlock your electronic anklet.
Daddy!
Okay, she's in.
Please somebody help me!
Now all we need is someone to... bury her.
You better kill us both.
Oh, I'd like to.
But I need ya.
Bury her.
Throw him in the truck.
Dadddy, please!
Please, somebody help me!
Danny!

Nice shirt.
It was a gift.
Give it back.
You must love her very much.
Who?
Whoever bought you that shirt.
Hi, it's Delinda.
Leave a message.
Hey, hey, Delinda, it's me.
Where are you?
Call me.
Danny--
-Hey
Uh, have you seen Delinda?
What?
Have you seen Delinda?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over that shirt.
No, seriously, it looks like a donkey and a rodeo clown met a shotgun.
Pooh!
Dude, Delinda gave it to me.
Yo, she gotta be crazy freaky in bed.
This is not necessary.
Sorry.
I'm a little worried about her.
I woke up this morning, and she wasn't there.
She worked the late shift last night, right?
Maybe she went to workout afterwards.
No, she would've called.
Yeah, she would've called.
I'll look around for her.
All right.
Wanna hit that buffet?
Mr. Turner, Mr. Hammond--
Welcome to the Montecito.
I'm Sam, your casino host.
Call me Sid.
Sid.
Yes, Willie Hammond.
Hi, Willie.
Millionaire.
Okay...
Uh, listen, seeing as this is your first visit to the Montecito, we just need to verify some account information with your respective banks.
It's pretty common practice.
We've brought cash.
Cash.
Cash-- $2 million each.
$2 million...
Each.
Hi.
Okay, well, we will hold that cash here at our casino cage, and credit your accounts accordingly.
All right.
What type of business are you two in?
We're not in any business at all!
No, no, no, there's no business.
Uh, we won the Pennsylvania state lottery.
Yeah, me and Willie here split 20 bucks on some tickets, split 20 bucks on some tickets, and we won the whole damn thing.
Oh-- * $43.7 million *
Ah!
That is dancing.
Oh, snap!
This is gonna be a long weekend.
Beg your pardon?
I said this is gonna be an amazing weekend!
Yeah!
I've arranged for two of the Montecito's finest suites for your stay.
Oh, great.
We're gonna need two rooms together.
Yeah, right next to each other.
Okay, well, I-- Yeah, you need to make that happen, or else we're leavin'.
With our cash.
Next to each other it is.
Hey, Ed.
So, uh, what...
You look awful.
Nice to see you too.
What happened?
Oh, um...
I fell down at the house.
No big deal.
I'm fine.
What do you think?
Go ahead, take a shot.
It's nice.
It's nice?
You don't--
You don't think it's a little much?
What the hell do I know about shirts, you know?
Look, I've got a really busy day today, so I need you to hold down the floor, okay?
Okay.
All right.
Okay, uh, have you seen Delinda?
She didn't come home last night, and she's not answering her cell phone.
I forgot to tell you that she's--
She's with her sister.
Nessa?
Nessa.
Nessa's here in town?
Do I stutter?
Don't worry about it.
Delinda's gonna call you later, all right?
Well, I haven't seen Nessa in forever.
Yeah, I know.
Where are they?
Yeah, uh, listen-- Do me a favor.
I don't want to be bothered, okay?
Huh?
Okay.
Hey, boss, how you doin'?
Hey, uh, it's not a good time now.
Yeah, well, it never seems to be a good time to tell you what I'm thinking, so I'm just gonna go for it.
Ed, I need to be more integral in the hotel's development and operations.
Right.
Now, with that in mind, I have a plan to boost the profile of the Montecito while improving our customer relations.
Okay.
The Montecito needs a mascot.
Right.
You see, uh, a popular mascot can be a source or corporate identity.
And, you know, statistics--
They--They bare out everything that I'm saying to you.
Restaurants that introduce mascots increase food and beverage sales as much as 17%.
So...
That sounds great.
Really?
You like my idea?
I do.
Yeah, just go for it.
Thank you, Ed.
Okay.
You won't be sorry.
Six please.
You really think this place needs a mascot?
Ten hours and counting, Eddie.
Temper, temper, Eddie!
You might want to remind yourself what this is all about.
Huh?
A pity, isn't it?
So far, you've done a good job keeping the security counterparts and throwing 'em off the trail.
Stay focused, Eddie.
This is me.
This'll be over soon.
Remember, Eddie, we're watchin'.
Always watching'.
Jillian!
Hi, Danny.
The good news about Nessa, huh?
Nessa?
What are you talking about?
Well, Ed just told me that Nessa's in town and that she's with Delinda.
Why would Ed tell you that?
So she's not in town?
Danny, I would know if the daughter
I haven't seen for two years was here.
Yeah, of course you would.
You know what?
Maybe I just misunderstood.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah...
You haven't spoken to Delinda today, have you?
No, I got her machine this morning.
Are you two fighting?
No.
No, no.
Not that I know of, anyway.
I--I just...
She's not answering her cell phone, so...
She's probably just lost it again.
Okay!
Thank you...
Danny--
Honey, I'm sure she's fine, but, uh, when you talk to her, let me know, okay?
And I'll do the same.
Okay.
Hey.
Uh, how much you holdin' here on the floor?
Give me a second.
$18 million.
Thanks.
$16 million.
$6 mil.
Thanks.
Nine.
Six.
15.
This is Ed Deline at the Montecito.
Customer number 890087.
Yeah, I need an additional $25 million delivered to the casino.
Would you tell John it's for me?
And I need it rushed.
Um...
Two hours?
You're ordering more money?
We just got our delivery.
I got a couple whales comin' in.
Million dollar players.
Sorry?
Yeah, thank you.
Are you sure we need that?
No, I'm not sure, that's why I ordered it.
What is this, second guess Saturday?
Okay, here's an idea for ya.
Don't spread yourself too thin, all right?
Doin' both our jobs.
Sorry.
Okay, I was just-- What?
Leavin'?
No.
No, I--I want to know why you lied to me about Nessa.
What, are you checking up on me?
I talked to Jillian.
You don't check up on me!
I am worried about Delinda, okay?
Well, so am I.
Yep?
Be very careful here, Ed.
Now, get rid of him, and get me my money.
Right.
They want you on the floor.
Okay.
You need anything, just...
I know.
I really need you to leave now.
Hey, Sam, these rooms are great.
I am so glad you like them.
Now listen--If there is anything I can do to make your stay more enjoyable, you don't hesitate to ask, all right?
Hey, now, the whole hotel is open to us?
Yeah, of course.
High stakes parlor is located on the main casino floor.
Now, I'm-- Hey--
We can't gamble, though, until the game is finished.
What game?
Hide and seek.
When you say hide and seek, you don't mean...
Yeah.
Yeah, like the kids game.
Hide and seek.
Why--Why would you play that?
For money.
Yeah, we put up a million each.
You're playing hide and seek for $2 million?
Exactly.
And the game starts now.
We're run for 12 hours?
Right.
Synchronize watches.
Ready?
Yes.
O-kay.
Ready?
Yeah.
One, two, three.
Scissors cut paper.
You're it!
[laughing] Hey, hey!
You guys are gonna gamble, right?
Three-- Yeah, don't worry about it.
30!
You don't gamble,
I can't extend the Montecito's hospitality to you.
[sighs]
Uh, why are your whales running?
Uh, because they can't swim.
They're playing hide and seek.
Right.
Mm.
Uh, how much are they gonna play for over the weekend?
Couple million each.
Do you have any other high rollers coming in?
No, just Orville and Wilbur.
Why?
Because Ed orders an extra $25 million to accommodate a guest.
You know anything about that?
No, I don't know anything about that.
Okay, keep an eye on 'em.
[under breath] Oh, this is gonna suck.
Danny said you told him that Delinda's with Nessa.
No.
Where is Delinda, Ed?
She told me, uh, she went to that spa at Red Rocks.
Uh, I guess Danny and her had some kind of fight and, uh, she wanted some, uh, what do they call it now?
Private time.
Should I go meet her?
No, she'll be fine.
Why didn't she call me?
How should I know?
I mean, she told you, but she didn't tell me, and then--
And why would Danny say that you said that?
Again, honey, how should I know?
And, um...
I really think that we should stay out of their personal lives.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would--
Jillian, please.
Fine.
Having a bad day?
I, um, I got a lot of stuff going on.
You'd tell me if something was wrong, wouldn't you?
Of course I would.
Okay.
I'll see you at home tonight.
Okay.
Honey?
I love you.
I love you too.
Kelly--
Would you excuse us a minute please?
Thanks.
Tommy, listen, um...
I need you to pack $25 million cash for transport, a'right?
$25 million.
Yeah.
For what?
What do you mean, for what?
When do you need it?
I need it right now.
Ed, you know I can't do that.
Pull that kind of cash off the floor,
I gotta close down half the casino.
Close down half the casino.
We'll lose millions if I do that.
Listen, this isn't a frickin' debate, Tommy.
Just do what I tell ya.
All right?
Now, listen-- I want the money bound.
I want it wrapped in plastic and put on pallets.
I need two signatures to make it-- I'll sign twice.
You know, I can't do it.
I'll lose my job.
Yeah, you're right, Tom.
Hey, Bill--
Yes, sir?
You just got promoted.
You're new cage manager.
Ed-- You're fired, Tommy.
Get out.
Come on, Ed.
I said get out.
Get out!
You, uh, heard?
You understood my request?
Yes, sir.
$25 million right away, Mr. Deline.
You ready?
As I'll ever be.
All right, Mike, I present to you the Montecito's new mascot.
Ta-da!
Monty Montecito.
I don't get it.
He's a prospector.
I can see that.
(Mary) So?
So what does prospecting have to do with the Montecito?
He will help you "mine" your fortunes from our casino.
I still don't get it.
Research has shown us that people wanna see more
49er-style prospectors in their casinos.
Research?
The man in a suit has done stints as Mayor McCheese, a Teletubby, and a brief tour as Barney Rubble.
I couldn't be more excited.
And you're sure you've cleared this with Ed.
Yeah, he told me to go for it.
So I say we let Monty Montecito show people just how much fun this hotel can be.
The Montecito has a mascot.
I see that.
I don't get the whole prospector thing.
Not so much.
Do you know that Ed just fired Tommy, the cage manager?
Tommy?
He's been with Ed forever.
He'd never do that.
He just did.
I just talked to Tommy.
He said that he questioned him about taking 25 million bucks off the floor.
But I saw a security manifest sent from the bank.
Ed just ordered an additional $25 million to be brought in.
What the hell's going on, Mike?
Like that damn mascot?
It's not making any sense.
No, we need to find out what Ed's gonna do with 50 million bucks.
Mitch, pull up surveillance footage of Ed today, will you?
You got it.
Thanks.
Who the hell is that?
(Mike) What's he showing' him?
Zoom in.
[beeping]
Can't, it's blowing out.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Something is seriously wrong.
Okay, I think that this has something to do with Delinda because he told me that she's with Nessa.
Nessa?
Yeah.
But she's-- I know.
I think that it was Ed's way of tipping' me off.
Uh, Mitch, video IQ the guy in the elevator, will you?
There's no matches.
Want me to try some other database?
Yeah, keep working on it.
Show me some surveillance footage of, uh, Delinda.
Delinda.
Yeah.
What--This guy keeps poppin' up.
See this?
Yeah.
Look at that.
Here.
Let's go here.
Then again right there.
Hey, show me the entrance from shift change.
Okay, she's alone.
There he is again.
Hey, Mitch, video IQ this guy, will you?
Here we go.
Russ DeBeers.
Oh, he's got a record for felony assault.
What the hell's she doing?
She getting in the car.
(Mike) Could have a gun.
No license plate.
Where the hell is she?
Hey!
Hey!
Hi, Sam!
Hi, what the hell are ya doin'?
What?
I said what the hell ya doin'?
He's in the shower.
Okay, listen, I need to know when you and Willie plan on gambling.
Soon, real soon.
Listen--This is-- This is--
I'll pay for it.
No.
Uh-uh.
Uh--
Okay, I'm sorry.
I can't...
N-n-n-no.
N-n-no.
Listen to me.
Hey!
Hey, come here!
[sighs]
(Willie) Hey!
Ow!
Can I have my shoe back?
You gonna gamble?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
He's naked.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Which way did he go?
Thatta way.
Put some clothes on.
Took you long enough.
It's been three minutes.
And why in the hell would you want to meet in here?
You know brothers can't stand the cold.
They're out there.
Who?
I don't know.
Whoever it is that's watching Ed.
They're--They're tracking his movements, who he's interacting with.
He lied to me.
He tried to take 50 million bucks off the floor.
And where the hell is Delinda?
Kidnappers.
So what do we do?
We help him.
Ooh!
Hey, he grabbed my ass!
All the money's coming in.
Everything's pretty much business as usual.
Great.
Oh, I almost forgot that, uh, about that problem in the casino's southeast bathroom?
Yeah?
The problem was in one of the stalls.
It's been fixed, I know you wanted to check it out.
So...
Yeah.
When I get a chance.
Okay, I'm going back to the floor.
Oh, Danny--
Um...
I just wanna say thanks, kid.
No problem.
Hey, Sid-- Hi, we need to talk.
Uh, in a minute, okay?
So, anyway, we're at the high rollers suite.
You should come up for a drink.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah, and maybe if you had a friend, you know, you could bring her along.
And who knows--
Oh!
Ow!
Hey!
Wait a...
Hey!
Wow, it's pretty cold in there, huh?
Hey, sweetie.
Hi.
How ya doin'?
I wish I was dead.
Yeah, I can see why.
Yeah.
(Mary) You see the mascot I brought in?
No, and I have no desire to see the mascot--
Tough, come with me.
No, I don't-- I'm not kidding.
(Mary) I don't care.
I don't get it.
He's a prospector.
Looks like he struck something.
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Stop that!
Hey!
I lost my pants.
[laughs]
I got it.
I got it under control.
Hey!
Yep.
I'm having a GPS tracking device put under the firewall, detectable only if the bad guys find our frequency.
The helicopters are ready to go on your order.
Okay.
Okay, good.
I want you to, uh, over see hotel security and be the liaison between the FBI once we get Delinda back, okay?
And you are gonna get her back.
You bet your ass.
[knocking] Yeah.
I was asked to deliver this personally to you, Mr. Deline.
Thank you.
[dialing] [ringing]
Hello, Ed, nice of you to call.
I can do without the pleasantries.
When the money arrives, you will drive it towards Henderson.
Alone.
You'll receive further instructions on this cell phone.
Any deviation from this plan will be noncompliance, and your daughter dies.
Understood?
Yeah, understood.
Look forward to seein' ya, Ed.
You have no idea.
(Mike) Notify Mr. Deline and send guards out to the truck.
Okay.
$25 million just arrived at the loading dock.
Okay, let's pull the other $25 million off the floor.
Let's close down half the gaming tables, the north and south slot areas, and all the high roller pits.
Let's do it.
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Stop.
What's up, Sam?
I've had enough.
You had-- That's what's up, okay?
You need to either gamble or I'm throwing you out.
Wh--Why didn't you say something?
I'll get my gamble on.
Uh, say it.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, excuse me.
My man--uh, $500,000 red.
$500,000 red.
Place your bets.
And no more bets please.
36 red.
Damn!
Whoo!
[cheering]
Yes!
Credit my account.
Nice.
You see?
See ya.
Yeah, no--
Hey, you--
You need to gamble or you're out of here.
Why didn't ya just say something?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
$500,000 black.
$500,000 black.
No more bets.
Come on, black.
Come on, black.
13.
Winner.
Black 13.
[cheering]
Credit my account.
You really should have golf carts.
Uh--
You should really have a heart attack.
Hey--
I need you to shut down blackjack tables 18 through 51.
Does Mr. Deline know about this?
Yes.
Per his orders.
Now, now.
Okay.
All right, let's move out.
Mr. Deline--
Yeah?
I don't have to tell you that this is breaking security protocol.
Listen, I'll indemnify you.
Here--You got something for me to sign here?
All right, load the money in the truck, will ya?
Yes, sir.
Load it up, guys.
[blues rock music]
*
Oh!
Ha!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
Thirty!
Ah!
Touch me and I will kick your ass.
Okay, thanks.
The helicopter's waiting for you on the roof.
Thanks.
Let me know the second you get Delinda back and I'll make the call.
Nothing until I tell you she's safe.
You got it.
Let's go!
All right, keep your distance.
Roger that.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
No, no, no, no.
Monty--
You're fired.
'Cause you're drunk.
Yes.
And you were also fondling guests.
We have a dozen complaints against you.
Sorry, Monty, but... we're gonna have to let you go.
I'm sorry.
Get up.
No, no, no.
Come on, come one, come on.
You're outta here, pal.
You're outta here.
Come on.
Yeah.
Oh, I guess I gotta whip some foam ass.
Yeah.
Ah, ah!
Uh!
Uh!
Uh!
Unh!
Unh!
Unh!
Unh!
Unh!
?
And stay out, ya foam lowlife!
Aw...
N-n-no, no.
Nicely handled.
You know, it's sad when a mascot loses his way.
15 more seconds and I win $1 million.
Mmm.
And then you will gamble?
Absolutely.
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
Who the hell are you?
Four, three, two--
Hey, who the hell is that guy?
Ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
[laughing]
I won!
A million dollars, baby!
[laughing] Ah!
Thanks for the suit, Sam.
No problem.
Hey--credit my account.
Ah!
No!
This is a do-over!
What?
I'm not paying you.
We said nothing about costumes!
What?
It's not the point!
I would've been a big chipmunk!
You know that.
No, you always do that.
I love to dress up!
Do-over!
It's a do-over!
You're sad!
You're million...
You cheap millionaire.
Get out of the truck.
Hands where I can see 'em.
Money's in the truck.
All right, check the money for dye packs, transmitters, the number sequences on the bills.
Where is my daughter?
Patience, Eddie.
Patience.
No patience, pal.
Right now, where is she?
Now.
The money's clean.
Okay, move it to the trucks.
Let's go.
Okay.
There's your daughter.
Now time is running out, so if I were you, I would hurry.
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
Come on!
Step it up!
Oh, hey, Chips...
Yeah.
You want me to kill him?
No, no.
No, that'll happen soon enough.
Take the keys out of his truck.
Let's go!
Finish up!
Ed-- Good punch.
Enjoy your walk.
Let's go!
[ringing]
Yeah?
Danny--
Danny, listen--
Delinda's buried.
Did you just say Delinda's buried?
Yeah.
Where?
The coordinates are north 36, 04.
West, 115, 09.
Okay, got it.
When you get there, dig up the box, but do not open it.
It's rigged with explosives.
I'll give you the combination.
Okay.
Okay, all right.
We're on our way.
Oh, that ain't good.
Okay, we're here.
There it is!
Right here!
Right here!
Right here.
Dig!
Come on.
Okay.
Give me the combination.
Combination is 7, 11, 12.
7, 11, 12.
Come on.
Ed, she's not here!
Delinda's not here!
Son of a bitch.
Danny...
I'm not gonna make it, kid.
You gotta find Delinda and bring her back.
What're you talking about?
There's no time.
Just promise me you'll find her.
Promise me.
Ed.
Ed!
Ed, listen to me!
Ed!
Listen to--
I'll see ya, kid.

Ed
Talk to me Ed
Ed
Your father is dead.
?
CCCCCCCCCCCCC
Kids, life is a dark road.
You never really know what's up ahead.
One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride,
And then all of a sudden, you're 28.
And for the birthday boy,
Lasagna.
Thank you.
Careful.
The plate is very hot.
'kay.
Oh, go on, touch it.
Ah!
Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
All right, so, barney, are you doing this or what?
Oh, geez, barney, don't do this.
I have to, it's my birthday present to ted.
You don't have to.
Please, it's going to be embarrassing
And we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck...
In addition to probably being kind of healthy.
Come on, marshall,
It's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Barney.
Oy, gevalt.
Ah...
Happy birthday, ted.
Whoo-hoo!
Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y...
Oh, my god.
What?
Oh!
Call an ambulance!
What's going on?
Try not to speak.
Here, sit down.
Just don't talk, don't talk.
Is she okay?
I'm serious, call 911.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Shh!
Shh!
Just don't move.
Don't move.
Just try...
Here, have some water.
Water!
Here, drink this.
Shh!
Shh!
You know, the more I watch this,
The less convinced I am
That it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Wait for it.
28.
Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.
Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad.
Well, except for the goat in my bathroom.
But I'll get to that later.
Still, you know, another year older.
Still single.
You don't hear your tedological clock ticking?
Nope.
I hit the snooze button.
And here come the paramedics.
Oh, thank god, you're here.
What is going on?
!
I think there might be some internal bleeding.
Probably some fractures.
We got to get her to the hospital.
What are you talking about?
You've had a terrible fall.
No, I haven't.
Really?
'cause I could swear
You fell straight out of heaven.
Angel...
Bing!
Give him your number.
What?
Give him your number.
What?
- Give him your number.
Come on, you're embarrassing me.
Give him your number.
What are you...?
Come on.
Give him your number.
They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.
Give him your number.
All right!
It works!
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, everyone.
It's been fun.
It's wendy the waitress.
Tip her well.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Troilus and cressida.
Neighborhood playhouse.
Check them out, they're good, they're good.
I realize why I'm still single.
I'm picky.
I'm not going to settle.
If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.
Well, what's perfect?
It's not like I have a list.
Oh, yes, you do.
Attractive, college-educated,
She wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...
That's not hard.
I know at least...
I'm not done.
She likes dogs,
Otis redding, does the crossword.
She's into sports, but not so much so
That her legs are, like, more muscular than mine.
That weirds me out.
And she plays bass guitar like kim deal from the pixies.
Or kim gordon from sonic youth.
Any kim from any cool band, really.
Can't be too picky.
You're never going to find this girl.
Exactly.
So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me.
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.
So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?
That's the plan.
And little did I know, at that very moment,
Fate-- in the form of a 600 gigahertz
Superprocessing computer--
Was taking care of it.
Whoa, you're up early.
Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.
Does marshall know?
He's still sound asleep.
Awesome.
So awesome.
God!
Best girl ever.
Screw these pancakes,
I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.
Please don't do that.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.
God, why didn't you throw it away?
I'm going shopping after work.
I'll pick up some milk.
Oh...!
These pancakes are delightful.
What's wrong, baby?
This is the high point of my day.
It was true.
See, marshall had always dreamed
Of using his law degree to protect the environment.
But he needed money for the wedding,
So he'd been interning for two months at barney's firm...
And he hated every minute of it.
Hey, barney, I had some questions
About filling out these requisition forms.
Binoculars.
Second pair on my desk.
I don't have time to be creepy, dude.
I have a lot of work to do.
Just take a look, will ya?
Okay, corner office.
Top floor.
Check out that guy.
Name's clark butterfield.
He works over at nicholson, hewitt and west
And every morning, he orders a sandwich
From the deli downstairs.
So?
So guess what I did to that sandwich?
Here, I took a picture.
Oh!
Sweet lord.
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.
Ooh!
Duck!
That is sick!
Why would you do that?
Who knows?
This feud goes so far back
I can't remember who fired the first shot.
You?
Totally.
Well, look, if you would just...
Help me fill out these forms, that would be great.
What?
Butterfield is going to retaliate
Within the next four hours.
That's been his pattern.
This is war, eriksen.
I need you to clear your schedule,
Call lily, tell her you'll be home late.
This is stupid.
Stu...
Come on, man,
I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills.
I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.
This is a job for me, barney.
It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it.
Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.
Tracy, could you come in here, please?
Would you please inform mr.
Eriksen
That I'm no longer speaking to him.
Mr. Eriksen, mr.
Stinson
Is no longer...
I get it.
Thank you, tracy.
Hello?
Hello.
May I speak with a mr.
Ted mosby?
Speaking.
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir?
Bob rorschach over here at love solutions.
You signed up for our services about six months ago.
Uh, yeah.
You guys never found me a match.
Right.
Well...
Actually, that's why I'm calling.
We found her, sir.
We found your soul mate.
I don't understand.
What happened to ellen pierce?
Doesn't she run this place?
Well, my firm bought out the company.
You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate,
But the geniuses
At corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so...
Here I am.
So I'm in good hands.
You found me a match?
There she is.
Your soul mate.
That'll be 500 bucks.
No way.
The last time I did this,
The girl turned out to be engaged.
She's not engaged.
She's your soul mate.
Just read the file.
So I read the file.
And by god, this woman was perfect.
She liked dogs, she spent her summers in north carolina,
She played bass guitar, she did the times crossword,
She played tennis, she liked old movies,
Her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was
Her favorite singer was otis redding
And she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.
All right, fine.
Set it up.
You wanted to see me,
So I guess that means we're talking again?
Will you taste this latte for me?
I think they gave me decaf.
Tastes normal to me.
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from butterfield.
Oh, god!
It got me as well.
Well, then why did you have me drink it?
!
Because now...
You're in.
Okay.
Don't think I'm overlooking
The obvious fact that I should just be mad at you.
But executive mischief consultant marshall eriksen
Reporting for duty.
Let's make that bastard pay.
You think that we should brush our teeth first?
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
So that night I had a blind date
With my perfect match.
I was so excited, I got there early.
But before it even started...
Lily?
Hey, ted, are you busy?
Um...
Yes.
Oh, right.
Soul mate.
Forgot.
Listen, could you take a cab out to duchess county
And change a flat on marshall's fiero?
What?
No.
Can't you just call marshall?
Marshall can't know about this.
Look, ted, it's dark,
I don't know how to change a tire,
And I've stumbled into the beginning
Of a very scary campfire story.
Can you please hurry?
I can't, I'm waiting...
Oh, my god, is that a drifter
With a hook for a hand?
No, drifter, no!
Come on, lily.
But you see my point.
All right, stay there.
I'm on my way.
And, so, one $90 cab ride later,
Oh, thank god.
I'm so sorry about this.
Did you get ahold of your date?
Yes.
And was she okay
About pushing it back?
Yes.
Because she's perfect.
So what am I doing here?
You can never tell marshall.
Swear.
Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
I swear on luke and leia.
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.
Marrying marshall had been all I wanted for a long time.
But, now that it was really happening,
It seemed kind of huge and scary.
Did you talk to marshall about it?
He wouldn't have understood.
He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.
So I spent my nights reading, painting,
Setting the high score on super bomber man...
That was you?
Awesome!
I know!
I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.
And then I started thinking about victoria
And how she followed her dream to germany,
And I found this art fellowship.
Let me guess.
It's somewhere far away.
San francisco.
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.
But I love painting,
And I've always wondered if I'm any good.
This was a way to find out.
And the interview is tonight.
In new haven.
You don't want to get married.
Of course I want to get married.
I...
It's not like I was ever going to do it.
I just...
I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
Lily, we live in the center
Of art and culture in america.
I'm sure you could find a program here
That's just as selective.
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away,
And you didn't tell marshall.
I think it's pretty clear what that means.
Okay, I was...
I was having second thoughts.
Oh, man!
But I'm not anymore.
I...
I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.
I'm supposed to go home and-and be with marshall.
You must think I'm so stupid.
I don't think you're stupid.
I love marshall.
I know you do.
Come here.
It's okay.
Look...
Marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.
But why am I the only one?
How come marshall isn't doing anything crazy?
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.
All done.
Ted, let's go to new haven.
Lily, don't do this to yourself.
I just need to know if I can get in.
If I do this interview, and get into the program,
Then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married.
Come on!
It's an adventure.
No, it's not an adventure.
It's a mistake.
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.
But there are certain things in life
Where you know it's a mistake
But you don't really know it's a mistake
Because the only way to really know it's a mistake
Is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, "yep.
That was a mistake."
So, really, the bigger mistake
Would be to not make the mistake,
Because then you go your whole life
Not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!
I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship,
My career-- mistake-free.
Does any of this make sense to you?
I don't know.
You said "mistake" a lot.
Lily, don't do this.
Ted, I'm getting married in two months,
And I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend,
And you just have to forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what?
Lily.
Lily!
Hey, lily, this is ted,
The guy you left stranded by the side of the road.
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview,
Remember to pick up some milk...
Oh, and, when I get home,
I'm going to kill you.
And, also, I texted you the same thing.
Hey, I need a big favor.
Anything, bro.
I need you to come up to duchess county and pick me up.
No.
It's kind of an emergency.
What are you doing in duchess county?
Apple picking.
Can you just get up here?
I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work.
We're kind of swamped.
Is that ted?
Yeah.
He's stuck in duchess county.
Don't you have a big date tonight?
Uh...
Marshall.
Hi.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
So what are you doing in duchess county?
Can't a brother go apple picking
Without getting the third degree?
Damn!
Okay, well, hang on.
I'm coming to get you.
Relax, man.
I'll take the fiero.
No, no, no.
Just...
Forget it.
Ha, ha!
A little prank.
I'm not in duchess county.
So that's the prank?
That you're not in duchess county?
Yep.
Gotcha!
Classic!
Gotta go.
Hey, check out this one.
It actually looks like butterfield.
You know, over at the nrdc,
It's a bunch of really committed people
Who take their job of saving the earth
Very, very seriously.
Which is great, and everything,
But I can't imagine having this much fun over there.
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?
Maybe.
Don't tell lily, okay?
Taking off for the night.
Thanks, tracy.
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
Of course we are.
Were you going to think of that?
No.
That would have been bad.
Horrible.
Ooh!
Luckily, there was still one person I could call
To get a ride home.
Need a ride, cowboy?
Sorry.
I don't get in vans with strangers.
Hmm, too bad.
I got candy.
Candy?
!
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing
By the side of a highway in duchess county?
Nope.
Sworn to secrecy.
Oh, come on.
I like your hat.
Right.
This is embarrassing.
I got highlights.
Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice?
Highlights is a children's magazine.
Yeah, I got it.
I thought it might look cool.
Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean,
"I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat.
Oh.
I gotta see this.
No way.
Please.
I bet it doesn't look that bad.
I bet it looks grr-eat!
So, she says, changing the subject.
Big date tonight.
How does she rate on the mosby checklist?
Kind of amazingly.
Uh, she's 28, like me.
Wow, I'm 28.
Hmm.
Uh...
College educated-- check.
Plays tennis-- check.
Uh, favorite book is love in the time of cholera-- check.
I read that.
More like "love in the time of don't bothera."
You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.
I'm just saying.
We're not indoors.
We're in a van.
Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.
Never.
What else?
She loves lasagna.
Barf.
You know, I am sensing a pattern here.
What else?
Let's see what else...
Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.
Ah!
And she's looking to get married and have kids?
Check and check.
She wants two kids-- a boy and a girl.
Wow.
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.
Really?
You don't want kids?
You know, ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you.
Hey.
I'm driving.
Look at that.
8:56.
You're early.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.
Thanks.
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.
I want you to go in there
With a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.
You're going to show me your hair?
Actually, I was going to show you my breasts,
But...
Sure, we can do hair.
You just made my night.
Go.

Tomorrow morning, barney's going to send out the package,
And butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.
Oh, hey, dude.
Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey.
So, lil, did you, uh, get the milk?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I got it.
You think you might want to...
Drink the milk?
No.
Nope, I'm good.
I don't need any milk.
Look, guys, I know milk is important--
It's got vitamin a, vitamin d,
It's a great way to start the morning--
But ted just had a huge date.
How'd it go, dude?
I didn't go.
What?
Why?
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.
Why?
She sounds perfect.
I don't want perfect.
I want robin.
Oh, god, not this again.
Ted, it's a mistake.
Maybe.
But it's a mistake I have to make.
Wrong.
It's a mistake you don't have to make.
Look at the evidence.
You and robin have tried this again and again...
Here's the thing about mistakes.
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake,
You gotta make it anyway.
Ah, sweet damn that's a hot plate.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Even really, really dumb mistakes.
Kids, life is a dark road.
You never really know what's up ahead.
One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride, and then all of a sudden, you're 28.
And for the birthday boy, lasagna.
Thank you.
Careful.
The plate is very hot.
'Kay.
Oh, go on, touch it.
Ah!
Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?
Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.
I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.
You don't have to.
Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.
Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Barney.
Oy, gevalt.
- Ah...
Happy birthday, Ted.
- Whoo-hoo!
Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y...
Oh, my God.
What?
Oh!
Call an ambulance!
- What's going on?
- Try not to speak.
Here, sit down.
Just don't talk, don't talk.
- Is she okay?
- I'm serious, call 911.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Shh!
Shh!
Just don't move.
Don't move.
Just try...
Here, have some water.
Water!
Here, drink this.
Shh!
Shh!
You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Wait for it.
28.
Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.
Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad.
Well, except for the goat in my bathroom.
Which is a great story.
But I'll get to that later.
Still, you know, another year older.
Still single.
You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?
Nope.
I hit the snooze button.
And here come the paramedics.
Oh, thank God, you're here.
What is going on?
!
I think there might be some internal bleeding.
Probably some fractures.
We got to get her to the hospital.
What are you talking about?
- You've had a terrible fall.
- No, I haven't.
Really?
'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven.
Angel...
Give him your number.
What?
Give him your number.
What?
- Give him your number.
- Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.
- Give him your number.
- What are you...?
Come on.
They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.
- All right!
- It works!
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, everyone.
It's been fun.
It's Wendy the waitress.
Tip her well.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Troilus and Cressida.
Neighborhood Playhouse.
Check them out, they're good.
I realize why I'm still single.
I'm picky.
I'm not going to settle.
If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.
Well, what's perfect?
- It's not like I have a list.
- Oh, yes, you do.
Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...
- That's not hard.
I know at least...
- I'm not done.
She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword.
She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine.
That weirds me out.
And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.
Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.
Any Kim from any cool band, really.
Can't be too picky.
You're never going to find this girl.
Exactly.
So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me.
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.
So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?
That's the plan.
And little did I know, at that very moment, fate-- in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer-- was taking care of it.
Whoa, you're up early.
Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.
Does Marshall know?
He's still sound asleep.
Awesome.
So awesome.
God!
Best girl ever.
Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.
Please don't do that.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.
God, why didn't you throw it away?
I'm going shopping after work.
I'll pick up some milk.
Oh...!
These pancakes are delightful.
What's wrong, baby?
This is the high point of my day.
It was true.
See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment.
But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it.
Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.
Binoculars.
Second pair on my desk.
I don't have time to be creepy, dude.
I have a lot of work to do.
Just take a look, will ya?
Okay, corner office.
Top floor.
Check out that guy.
Name's Clark Butterfield.
He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.
So?
So guess what I did to that sandwich?
Here, I took a picture.
Oh!
Sweet Lord.
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.
Ooh!
Duck!
That is sick!
Why would you do that?
Who knows?
This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.
- You?
- Totally.
Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.
What?
Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours.
That's been his pattern.
This is war, Eriksen.
I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.
This is stupid.
Stu...
Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills.
I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.
This is a job for me, Barney.
It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it.
Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.
Tracy, could you come in here, please?
Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.
Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...
I get it.
Thank you, Tracy.
Hello?
Hello.
May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?
Speaking.
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir?
Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions.
You signed up for our services about six months ago.
Uh, yeah.
You guys never found me a match.
Right.
Well... actually, that's why I'm calling.
We found her, sir.
We found your soul mate.
I don't understand.
What happened to Ellen Pierce?
Doesn't she run this place?
Well, my firm bought out the company.
You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.
So I'm in good hands.
You found me a match?
There she is.
Your soul mate.
That'll be 500 bucks.
No way.
The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.
She's not engaged.
She's your soul mate.
Just read the file.
So I read the file.
And by God, this woman was perfect.
She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding
and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.
All right, fine.
Set it up.
You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?
Will you taste this latte for me?
I think they gave me decaf.
Tastes normal to me.
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.
Oh, God!
It got me as well.
Well, then why did you have me drink it?
!
Because now... you're in.
Okay.
Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you.
But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.
Let's make that bastard pay.
You think that we should brush our teeth first?
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match.
I was so excited, I got there early.
But before it even started...
Lily?
Hey, Ted, are you busy?
Um... yes.
Oh, right.
Soul mate.
Forgot.
Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?
What?
What?
No.
Can't you just call Marshall?
Marshall can't know about this.
Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story.
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't, I'm waiting...
Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?
No, drifter, no!
Come on, Lily.
But you see my point.
All right, stay there.
I'm on my way.
And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, thank God.
I'm so sorry about this.
Did you get ahold of your date?
Yes.
And was she okay about pushing it back?
Yes.
Because she's perfect.
So what am I doing here?
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.
Ever.
Swear.
Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
I swear on Luke and Leia.
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.
Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time.
But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.
Did you talk to Marshall about it?
He wouldn't have understood.
He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.
So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...
That was you?
Awesome!
I know!
I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.
And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.
Let me guess.
It's somewhere far away.
San Francisco.
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.
But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good.
This was a way to find out.
And the interview is tonight.
In New Haven.
You don't want to get married.
Of course I want to get married.
I...
It's not like I was ever going to do it.
I just...
I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America.
I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective.
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall.
I think it's pretty clear what that means.
Okay, I was...
I was having second thoughts.
But I'm not any more.
I...
I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.
I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall.
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do.
Come here.
It's okay.
Look...
Marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.
But why am I the only one?
How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.
All done.
Ted, let's go to New Haven.
Lily, don't do this to yourself.
I just need to know if I can get in.
If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married.
Come on!
It's an adventure.
No, it's not an adventure.
It's a mistake.
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.
But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake,
and look back, and say, "Yep.
That was a mistake."
So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!
I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free.
Does any of this make sense to you?
I don't know.
You said "mistake" a lot.
Lily, don't do this.
Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what?
Lily.
Lily!
Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road.
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk...
Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you.
And, also, I texted you the same thing.
- Hey, I need a big favor.
- Anything, bro.
I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.
No.
It's kind of an emergency.
What are you doing in Duchess County?
Apple picking.
Can you just get up here?
I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work.
We're kind of swamped.
Is that Ted?
Yeah.
He's stuck in Duchess County.
Don't you have a big date tonight?
Uh...
Marshall.
Hi.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
So what are you doing in Duchess County?
Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree?
Damn!
Okay, well, hang on.
I'm coming to get you.
No!
Relax, man.
I'll take the Fiero.
No, no, no.
Just... forget it.
Ha, ha!
A little prank.
I'm not in Duchess County.
So that's the prank?
That you're not in Duchess County?
Yep.
Gotcha!
Classic!
Gotta go.
Hey, check out this one.
It actually looks like Butterfield.
You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously.
Which is great, and everything, but
I can't imagine having this much fun over there.
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?
Maybe.
Don't tell Lily, okay?
Taking off for the night.
Thanks, Tracy.
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
Of course we are.
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.
Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.
Need a ride, cowboy?
Sorry.
I don't get in vans with strangers.
Hmm, too bad.
I got candy.
Candy?
!
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?
Nope.
Sworn to secrecy.
Oh, come on.
- I like your hat.
- Right.
This is embarrassing.
I got highlights.
Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice?
- Highlights is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.
I thought it might look cool.
Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean,
"I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat.
- Oh.
I gotta see this.
- No way.
Please.
I bet it doesn't look that bad.
I bet it looks grr-eat!
So, she says, changing the subject.
Big date tonight.
How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?
Kind of amazingly.
Uh, she's 28, like me.
Wow, I'm 28.
Hmm.
Uh, college educated-- check.
Plays tennis-- check.
Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.
I read that.
More like "Love in the Time of Don't Bothera."
You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.
I'm just saying.
We're not indoors.
We're in a van.
Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.
Never.
What else?
- She loves lasagna.
- Barf.
You know, I am sensing a pattern here.
What else?
Let's see what else...
Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.
And she's looking to get married and have kids?
Check and check.
She wants two kids-- a boy and a girl.
Wow.
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.
Really?
You don't want kids?
You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you.
Hey.
I'm driving.
Look at that. 8:56.
You're early.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.
Thanks.
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.
I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.
You're going to show me your hair?
Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.
You just made my night.
Go.
Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.
- Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey.
So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I got it.
You think you might want to... drink the milk?
No.
Nope, I'm good.
I don't need any milk.
Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date.
How'd it go, dude?
I didn't go.
What?
Why?
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.
Why?
She sounds perfect.
I don't want perfect.
I want Robin.
Oh, God, not this again.
Ted, it's a mistake.
Maybe.
But it's a mistake I have to make.
Wrong.
It's a mistake you don't have to make.
Look at the evidence.
You and Robin have tried this again and again...
Here's the thing about mistakes.
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.
Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.

I'm so sorry about this.
Did you get ahold of your date?
Y es.
And was she okay about pushing it back?
Yes.
Because she's perfect.
So what am I doing here?
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.
Ever.
Swear.
Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
I swear on Luke and Leia.
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.
Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time.
But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.
Did you talk to Marshall about it?
He wouldn't have understood.
He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.
So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...
That was you?
Awesome!
I know!
I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.
And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.
Let me guess.
It's somewhere far away.
San Francisco.
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.
But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good.
This was a way to find out.
And the interview is tonight.
In New Haven.
You don't want to get married.
Of course I want to get married.
I...
It's not like I was ever going to do it.
I just...
I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America.
I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective.
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall.
I think it's pretty clear what that means.
Okay, I was...
I was having second thoughts.
But I'm not any more.
I...
I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.
I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall.
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do.
Come here.
It's okay.
Look...
Marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.
But why am I the only one?
How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.
All done.
Ted, let's go to New Haven.
Lily, don't do this to yourself.
I just need to know if I can get in.
If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married.
Come on!
It's an adventure.
No, it's not an adventure.
It's a mistake.
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.
But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake,
and look back, and say, "Yep.
That was a mistake."
So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!
I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free.
Does any of this make sense to you?
I don't know.
You said "mistake" a lot.
Lily, don't do this.
Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what?
Lily.
Lily!
Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road.
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk...
Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you.
And, also, I texted you the same thing.
- Hey, I need a big favor.
- Anything, bro.
I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.
No.
It's kind of an emergency.
What are you doing in Duchess County?
Apple picking.
Can you just get up here?
I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work.
We're kind of swamped.
Is that Ted?
Yeah.
He's stuck in Duchess County.
Don't you have a big date tonight?
Uh...
Marshall.
Hi.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
So what are you doing in Duchess County?
Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree?
Damn!
Okay, well, hang on.
I'm coming to get you.
No!
Relax, man.
I'll take the Fiero.
No, no, no.
Just... forget it.
Ha, ha!
A little prank.
I'm not in Duchess County.
So that's the prank?
That you're not in Duchess County?
Yep.
Gotcha!
Classic!
Gotta go.
Hey, check out this one.
It actually looks like Butterfield.
You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously.
Which is great, and everything, but
I can't imagine having this much fun over there.
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?
Maybe.
Don't tell Lily, okay?
Taking off for the night.
Thanks, Tracy.
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
Of course we are.
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.
Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.
Need a ride, cowboy?
Sorry.
I don't get in vans with strangers.
Hmm, too bad.
I got candy.
Candy?
!
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?
Nope.
Sworn to secrecy.
Oh, come on.
- I like your hat.
- Right.
This is embarrassing.
I got highlights.
Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice?
- Highlights is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.
I thought it might look cool.
Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean,
"I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat.
- Oh.
I gotta see this.
- No way.
Please.
I bet it doesn't look that bad.
I bet it looks grr-eat!
So, she says, changing the subject.
Big date tonight.
How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?
Kind of amazingly.
Uh, she's 28, like me.
Wow, I'm 28.
Hmm.
Uh, college educated-- check.
Plays tennis-- check.
Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.
I read that.
More like "Love in the Time of Don't Bothera."
You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.
I'm just saying.
We're not indoors.
We're in a van.
Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.
Never.
What else?
- She loves lasagna.
- Barf.
You know, I am sensing a pattern here.
What else?
Let's see what else...
Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.
And she's looking to get married and have kids?
Check and check.
She wants two kids-- a boy and a girl.
Wow.
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.
Really?
You don't want kids?
You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you.
Hey.
I'm driving.
Look at that. 8:56.
You're early.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.
Thanks.
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.
I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.
You're going to show me your hair?
Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.
You just made my night.
Go.
Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.
- Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey.
So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I got it.
You think you might want to... drink the milk?
No.
Nope, I'm good.
I don't need any milk.
Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date.
How'd it go, dude?
I didn't go.
What?
Why?
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.
Why?
She sounds perfect.
I don't want perfect.
I want Robin.
Oh, God, not this again.
Ted, it's a mistake.
Maybe.
But it's a mistake I have to make.
Wrong.
It's a mistake you don't have to make.
Look at the evidence.
You and Robin have tried this again and again...
Here's the thing about mistakes.
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.
Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Even really really dumb mistakes.
OLDER TED;
Kids, life is a dark road, You never really know what's up ahead,
One night, you're cruising along, enjoying the ride, and then all of a sudden, you're 28,
- And for the birthday boy, lasagna.
- Thank you.
- Careful.
The plate is very hot.
- Okay.
Oh, go on, touch it.
(EX CLAIMS)
Sweet damn, that's a hot plate!
All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?
- Oh, jeez, Barney, don't do this.
- I have to.
It's my birthday present to Ted.
You don't have to.
Please, it's going to be embarrassing, and we're gonna have to stop coming here, which will suck, in addition to probably being kind of healthy.
Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Barney.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Ah!
Happy birthday, Ted.
(WHOOPS)
Excuse me, has anyone ever told you...
- Oh, my God!
- What?
Oh, call an ambulance!
- What's going on?
- Try not to speak.
Here, sit down.
Just don't talk.
Don't talk.
- Is she okay?
- I'm serious, call 911.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
(SHUSHING)
Just don't move.
Don't move.
Just try...
Here, have some water.
Water!
Here, drink this.
You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Wait for it.
Twenty-eight.
Two more until the big one.
Three-O.
OLDER TED;
Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad,
Well, except for the goat in my bathroom, Which is a great story,
(BLEATING)
But I'll get to that later,
Still, you know, another year older.
Still single.
You don't hear your Ted-o-Iogical clock ticking?
Nope.
I hit the snooze button.
And here come the paramedics.
- Oh, thank God, you're here.
- What is going on?
I think there might be some internal bleeding.
Probably some fractures.
We gotta get her to the hospital.
- What are you talking about?
- You've had a terrible fall.
No, I haven't.
Really?
'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven, Angel.
Give him your number.
What?
Give him your number.
What?
Give him your...
Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.
- Give him your number.
- Give him your number.
What are you...
Come on.
- Give him your number.
- Give him your number.
They're not going to stop till you give me your number.
- Give him your number.
- Give him your number.
- All right!
- It works!
(CHEERING)
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, everyone.
It's been fun.
It's Wendy the waitress.
Tip her well.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Troilus and Cressida, Neighborhood Playhouse.
Check them out, they're good.
They're good.
I realize why I'm still single.
I'm picky.
I'm not going to settle.
If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.
- Well, what's perfect?
- Well, it's not like I have a list.
- Oh, yes, you do.
- Attractive, college-educated.
She wants two kids, a boy and a girl.
- That's not hard.
I know at least...
- I'm not done.
She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword.
She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine.
That weirds me out.
And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.
- Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.
- Any Kim from any cool band, really.
- Can't be too picky.
- You're never going to find this girl.
Exactly.
So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me.
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.
So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?
That's the plan.
OLDER TED;
And little did I know, at that very moment, fate, in the form of a 600-gigahertz, super-processing computer was taking care of it,
(BEEPING)
(TED GROANING)
- Whoa, you're up early.
- Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.
- Does Marshall know?
- He's still sound asleep.
Awesome!
So awesome!
God!
Best girl ever.
Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.
TED:
Please don't do that.
Hey, is this milk any good?
(GAGS)
Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.
God, why didn't you throw it away?
I'm going shopping after work.
I'll pick up some milk.
Oh!
These pancakes are delightful.
What's wrong, baby?
This is the high point of my day.
OLDER TED;
It was true,
See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment,
But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm, and he hated every minute of it,
Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.
Binoculars.
Second pair, on my desk.
I don't have time to be creepy, dude.
I have a lot of work to do.
Just take a look, will you?
Hey, corner office.
Top floor.
Check out that guy.
BARNEY:
Name's Clark Butterfield.
He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West, and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.
- So?
- So, guess what I did to that sandwich?
Here, I took a picture.
Oh!
Sweet Lord!
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.
Duck!
That is sick!
- Why would you do that?
- Who knows?
This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot.
- You?
- Totally.
Well, look, if you would just help me fill out these forms, that would be great.
What?
Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours.
That's been his pattern.
This is war, Eriksen.
I need you to clear your schedule.
Call Lily.
Tell her you'll be home late.
This is stupid.
Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills.
I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.
This is a job for me, Barney.
It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it.
Now, I'm sorry, but I have work to do.
Tracy, could you come in here, please?
Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him?
- Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...
- I get it.
Thank you, Tracy.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Hello.
May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?
Speaking.
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir?
Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions.
You signed up for our services about six months ago,
Yeah.
You guys never found me a match.
Right.
Well, actually, that's why I'm calling.
We found her, sir, We found your soul mate,
I don't understand.
What happened to Ellen Pierce?
Doesn't she run this place?
Well, my firm bought out the company.
You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so here I am.
So I'm in good hands.
You found me a match?
There she is.
Your soul mate.
That'll be 500 bucks.
No way.
The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.
She's not engaged.
She's your soul mate.
Just read the file.
(SIGHS)
OLDER TED;
So I read the file, And, by God, this woman was perfect,
She liked dogs, She spent her summers in North Carolina,
She played bass guitar, She didThe Times crossword,
She played tennis, She liked old movies, Her favorite food was lasagna,
Her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera.
Her favorite singer was Otis Redding, And she wanted two kids, a boy and a girl,
All right, fine.
Set it up.
You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again.
Will you taste this latte for me?
I think they gave me decaf.
It tastes normal to me.
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.
- Oh, God!
- It got me as well.
Well, then why did you have me drink it?
Because now you're in.
Okay.
Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you.
But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.
Let's make that bastard pay.
You think that we should brush our teeth first?
- Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
- Let's go.
OLDER TED;
So, that night I had a blind date with my perfect match,
I was so excited, I got there early,
But before it even started,
(PHONE RINGING)
Lily?
Hey, Ted, are you busy?
Um, yes.
Oh, right.
Soul mate.
Forgot.
Listen, could you take a cab out to Dutchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?
What?
What?
No.
Can't you just call Marshall?
Marshall can't know about this.
Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story.
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't.
I'm waiting...
Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?
No, drifter, no!
- Come on, Lily.
- But you see my point.
All right, stay there.
I'm on my way.
OLDER TED;
And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere,
Oh, thank God.
I'm so sorry about this.
- Did you get ahold of your date?
- Yes.
- And was she okay about pushing it back?
- Yes.
Because she's perfect!
So, what am I doing here?
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.
Ever.
Swear.
Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
I swear on Luke and Leia.
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.
LIL Y;
Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time,
But now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary,
TED;
Did you talk to Marshall about it?
LIL Y;
He wouldn't have understood,
He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot,
(SNORING)
So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomberman,
- TED;
That was you?
Awesome!
- I know!
I just got in the zone and, Not the point of the story,
And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, then I found this art fellowship,

- San Francisco.
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.
But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good.
This was the way to find out.
- And the interview is tonight.
- In New Haven.
You don't want to get married.
Of course I want to get married!
I...
It's not like I was ever going to do it.
I just...
I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America.
I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective.

I was having second thoughts.
But I'm not anymore.
I...
I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.
I'm supposed to go home and be with Marshall.
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do.
Come here.
It's okay.
Look, marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.
But why am I the only one?
How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.
All done.
Ted, let's go to New Haven.
Lily, don't do this to yourself.
I just need to know if I can get in.
If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married.

Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend,
- and you just have to forgive me for this.
- But forgive you for what?
Lily.
Lily!
Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road.
Just wanted to say good luck with the interview.
Remember to pick up some milk.
Oh, and when I get home, I'm going to kill you.
And, also, I texted you the same thing.
Hey, I need a big favor.
Anything, bro.
I need you to come up to Dutchess County and pick me up.

This one actually looks like Butterfield.
(GIGGLING)
You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the Earth very, very seriously.
Which is great and everything, but
I can't imagine having this much fun over there.
You're thinking about coming to work here full-time?
Maybe.
- Don't tell Lily, okay?
- No.
- Taking off for the night.
- Thanks, Tracy.
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
Of course we are.
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.
OLDER TED;
Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home,
- Need a ride, cowboy?
- Sorry.
I don't get in vans with strangers.
- Too bad.
I got candy.

You just made my night.
Go.
(MOTHER OF PEARL PLA YING)
Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.
- Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.
- Hey.
So, Lil, did you get the milk?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
You think you might want to drink the milk?
No.
Nope, I'm good.
I don't need any milk.
Look, guys, I know milk is important.
It's got vitamin A, vitamin D.
It's a great way to start the morning, but Ted just had a huge date.
- How'd it go, dude?
- I didn't go.
What?
Why?
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.
Why?
She sounds perfect.
I don't want perfect.
I want Robin.
Oh, God, not this again.
- Ted, it's a mistake!
- Maybe.
But it's a mistake I have to make.
Wrong.
It's a mistake you don't have to make.
Look at the evidence.
You and Robin have tried this again and again...
OLDER TED;
Here's the thing about mistakes,
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it, anyway,
(EX CLAIMS)
Sweet damn, that's a hot plate!
Hey, is this milk any good?
(GAGS)
OLDER TED;
Even really, really dumb mistakes,
Ted:
Kids, life is a dark road.
You never really know what's up ahead.
One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride,
And then all of a sudden, you're 28.
And for the birthday boy,
Lasagna.
Thank you.
Careful.
The plate is very hot.
'Kay.
Oh, go on, touch it.
( Gasps ):
Ah!
Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
All right, so, barney, are you doing this or what?
Oh, geez, barney, don't do this.
I have to, it's my birthday present to ted.
You don't have to.
Please, it's going to be embarrassing
And we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck...
In addition to probably being kind of healthy.
Come on, marshall,
It's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Barney.
Oy, gevalt.
Ah...
Happy birthday, ted.
Whoo-hoo!
Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y...
Oh, my god.
What?
Oh!
Call an ambulance!
What's going on?
Try not to speak.
Here, sit down.
Just don't talk, don't talk.
Is she okay?
I'm serious, call 911.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Shh!
Shh!
Just don't move.
Don't move.
Just try...
Here, have some water.
Water!
Here, drink this.
Shh!
Shh!
Robin:
You know, the more I watch this,
The less convinced I am
That it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Wait for it.
28.
Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.
Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad.
Well, except for the goat in my bathroom.
But I'll get to that later.
Still, you know, another year older.
Still single.
You don't hear your tedological clock ticking?
Nope.
I hit the snooze button.
And here come the paramedics.
Oh, thank god, you're here.
What is going on?
!
I think there might be some internal bleeding.
Probably some fractures.
We got to get her to the hospital.
What are you talking about?
You've had a terrible fall.
No, I haven't.
Really?
'cause I could swear
You fell straight out of heaven.
Angel...
Bing!
( Under his breath ):
Give him your number.
What?
( Aloud ):
Give him your number.
What?
( louder ):
Give him your number.
Come on, you're embarrassing me.
( Chanting ):
Give him your number.
What are you...?
Come on.
Give him your number.
They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.
Give him your number.
All right!
It works!
( Cheering )
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, everyone.
It's been fun.
It's wendy the waitress.
Tip her well.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Troilus and cressida.
Neighborhood playhouse.
Check them out, they're good, they're good.
I realize why I'm still single.
I'm picky.
I'm not going to settle.
If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.
Well, what's perfect?
It's not like I have a list.
Oh, yes, you do.
Attractive, college-educated,
She wants two kids...
a boy and a girl...
That's not hard.
I know at least...
I'm not done.
She likes dogs,
Otis redding, does the crossword.
She's into sports, but not so much so
That her legs are, like, more muscular than mine.
That weirds me out.
And she plays bass guitar like kim deal from the pixies.
Or kim gordon from sonic youth.
Any kim from any cool band, really.
Can't be too picky.
You're never going to find this girl.
Exactly.
So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me.
I am done trying to plan the unplannable.
So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?
That's the plan.
And little did I know, at that very moment,
Fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz
Superprocessing computer...
Was taking care of it.
( beeping )
( groaning softly)
Whoa, you're up early.
Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.
Does marshall know?
He's still sound asleep.
Awesome.
So awesome.
God!
Best girl ever.
Screw these pancakes,
I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.
Ted:
Please don't do that.
Hey, is this milk any good?
( Retches, spits )
Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.
God, why didn't you throw it away?
Lily:
I'm going shopping after work.
I'll pick up some milk.
( Groans):
Oh...!
These pancakes are delightful.
What's wrong, baby?
This is the high point of my day.
It was true.
See, marshall had always dreamed
Of using his law degree to protect the environment.
But he needed money for the wedding,
So he'd been interning for two months at barney's firm...
And he hated every minute of it.
Hey, barney, I had some questions
About filling out these requisition forms.
Binoculars.
Second pair on my desk.
I don't have time to be creepy, dude.
I have a lot of work to do.
Just take a look, will ya?
Okay, corner office.
Top floor.
Check out that guy.
Name's clark butterfield.
He works over at nicholson, hewitt and west
And every morning, he orders a sandwich
From the deli downstairs.
So?
So guess what I did to that sandwich?
Here, I took a picture.
Oh!
Sweet lord.
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.
( Evil chuckling )
Ooh!
Duck!
That is sick!
Why would you do that?
Who knows?
This feud goes so far back
I can't remember who fired the first shot.
You?
Totally.
Well, look, if you would just...
Help me fill out these forms, that would be great.
What?
Butterfield is going to retaliate
Within the next four hours.
That's been his pattern.
This is war, eriksen.
I need you to clear your schedule,
Call lily, tell her you'll be home late.
This is stupid.
Stu...
Come on, man,
I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills.
I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.
This is a job for me, barney.
It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it.
Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.
( Typing )
Tracy, could you come in here, please?
Would you please inform mr.
Eriksen
That I'm no longer speaking to him.
Mr. Eriksen, mr.
Stinson
Is no longer...
I get it.
Thank you, tracy.
( Telephone rings )
Hello?
Hello.
May I speak with a mr.
Ted mosby?
Speaking.
Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir?
Bob rorschach over here at love solutions.
You signed up for our services about six months ago.
Uh, yeah.
You guys never found me a match.
Right.
Well...
Actually, that's why I'm calling.
We found her, sir.
We found your soul mate.
I don't understand.
What happened to ellen pierce?
Doesn't she run this place?
Well, my firm bought out the company.
You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate,
But the geniuses
At corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so...
Here I am.
So I'm in good hands.
You found me a match?
There she is.
Your soul mate.
That'll be 500 bucks.
No way.
The last time I did this,
The girl turned out to be engaged.
She's not engaged.
She's your soul mate.
Just read the file.
( Sighs )
So I read the file.
And by god, this woman was perfect.
She liked dogs, she spent her summers in north carolina,
She played bass guitar, she did the times crossword,
She played tennis, she liked old movies,
Her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was
Her favorite singer was otis redding
And she wanted two kids...
a boy and a girl.
All right, fine.
Set it up.
You wanted to see me,
So I guess that means we're talking again?
Will you taste this latte for me?
I think they gave me decaf.
Tastes normal to me.
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from butterfield.
Oh, god!
It got me as well.
Well, then why did you have me drink it?
!
Because now...
You're in.
Marshall:
Okay.
Don't think I'm overlooking
The obvious fact that I should just be mad at you.
But executive mischief consultant marshall eriksen
Reporting for duty.
Let's make that bastard pay.
You think that we should brush our teeth first?
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
So that night I had a blind date
With my perfect match.
I was so excited, I got there early.
But before it even started... ( cell phone rings )
Lily?
Hey, ted, are you busy?
Um...
Yes.
Oh, right.
Soul mate.
Forgot.
Listen, could you take a cab out to duchess county
And change a flat on marshall's fiero?
What?
No.
Can't you just call marshall?
Marshall can't know about this.
Look, ted, it's dark,
I don't know how to change a tire,
And I've stumbled into the beginning
Of a very scary campfire story.
Can you please hurry?
I can't, I'm waiting...
Oh, my god, is that a drifter
With a hook for a hand?
( Gasps ):
No, drifter, no!
Come on, lily.
But you see my point.
( Sighs )
All right, stay there.
I'm on my way.
Ted:
And, so, one $90 cab ride later,
Oh, thank god.
I'm so sorry about this.
Did you get ahold of your date?
Yes.
And was she okay
About pushing it back?
Yes.
Because she's perfect.
So what am I doing here?
You can never tell marshall.
Swear.
Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
I swear on luke and leia.
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.
Marrying marshall had been all I wanted for a long time.
But, now that it was really happening,
It seemed kind of huge and scary.
Ted:
Did you talk to marshall about it?
Lily:
He wouldn't have understood.
He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.
( snoring)
So I spent my nights reading, painting,
Setting the high score on super bomber man...
Ted:
That was you?
Awesome!
Lily:
I know!
I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.
And then I started thinking about victoria
And how she followed her dream to germany,
And I found this art fellowship.
Let me guess.
It's somewhere far away.
San francisco.
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.
But I love painting,
And I've always wondered if I'm any good.
This was a way to find out.
And the interview is tonight.
In new haven.
You don't want to get married.
Of course I want to get married.
I...
It's not like I was ever going to do it.
I just...
I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
Lily, we live in the center
Of art and culture in america.
I'm sure you could find a program here
That's just as selective.
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away,
And you didn't tell marshall.
I think it's pretty clear what that means.
Okay, I was...
I was having second thoughts.
Oh, man!
But I'm not anymore.
I...
I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.
I'm supposed to go home and-and be with marshall.
You must think I'm so stupid.
I don't think you're stupid.
I love marshall.
I know you do.
Come here.
It's okay.
Look...
Marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.
But why am I the only one?
How come marshall isn't doing anything crazy?
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.
All done.
Ted, let's go to new haven.
Lily, don't do this to yourself.
I just need to know if I can get in.
If I do this interview, and get into the program,
Then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married.
Come on!
It's an adventure.
No, it's not an adventure.
It's a mistake.
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.
But there are certain things in life
Where you know it's a mistake
But you don't really know it's a mistake
Because the only way to really know it's a mistake
Is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, "yep.
That was a mistake."
So, really, the bigger mistake
Would be to not make the mistake,
Because then you go your whole life
Not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!
I've done all of this...
my life, my relationship,
My career... mistake-free.
Does any of this make sense to you?
I don't know.
You said "mistake" a lot.
Lily, don't do this.
Ted, I'm getting married in two months,
And I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend,
And you just have to forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what?
Lily.
Lily!
Hey, lily, this is ted,
The guy you left stranded by the side of the road.
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview,
Remember to pick up some milk...
Oh, and, when I get home,
I'm going to kill you.
And, also, I texted you the same thing.
Hey, I need a big favor.
Anything, bro.
I need you to come up to duchess county and pick me up.
No.
It's kind of an emergency.
What are you doing in duchess county?
Apple picking.
Can you just get up here?
I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work.
We're kind of swamped.
Is that ted?
Yeah.
He's stuck in duchess county.
Don't you have a big date tonight?
Uh...
Marshall.
Hi.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
So what are you doing in duchess county?
Can't a brother go apple picking
Without getting the third degree?
Damn!
Okay, well, hang on.
I'm coming to get you.
Relax, man.
I'll take the fiero.
No, no, no.
Just...
Forget it.
Ha, ha!
A little prank.
I'm not in duchess county.
So that's the prank?
That you're not in duchess county?
Yep.
Gotcha!
Classic!
Gotta go.
Hey, check out this one.
It actually looks like butterfield.
You know, over at the nrdc,
It's a bunch of really committed people
Who take their job of saving the earth
Very, very seriously.
Which is great, and everything,
But I can't imagine having this much fun over there.
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?
Maybe.
Don't tell lily, okay?
Taking off for the night.
Thanks, tracy.
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
Of course we are.
Were you going to think of that?
No.
That would have been bad.
Horrible.
Ooh!
Luckily, there was still one person I could call
To get a ride home.
Need a ride, cowboy?
Sorry.
I don't get in vans with strangers.
Hmm, too bad.
I got candy.
Candy?
!
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing
By the side of a highway in duchess county?
Nope.
Sworn to secrecy.
Oh, come on.
I like your hat.
Right.
This is embarrassing.
I got highlights.
Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice?
Highlights is a children's magazine.
Yeah, I got it.
I thought it might look cool.
Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean,
"I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat.
Oh.
I gotta see this.
No way.
Please.
I bet it doesn't look that bad.
I bet it looks grr-eat!
So, she says, changing the subject.
Big date tonight.
How does she rate on the mosby checklist?
Kind of amazingly.
Uh, she's 28, like me.
Wow, I'm 28.
Hmm.
Uh...
College educated... check.
Plays tennis... check.
Uh, favorite book is love in the time of cholera... check.
I read that.
More like "love in the time of don't bothera."
( laughs )
You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.
I'm just saying.
We're not indoors.
We're in a van.
Vans have doors...
let me see your hair.
Never.
What else?
She loves lasagna.
Barf.
You know, I am sensing a pattern here.
What else?
( Inhales deeply)
Let's see what else...
Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger... check.
Ah!
And she's looking to get married and have kids?
Check and check.
She wants two kids...
a boy and a girl.
Wow.
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.
Really?
You don't want kids?
You know, ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you.
Hey.
I'm driving.
( Sighs) look at that.
8:56.
You're early.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.
Thanks.
( Exhales heavily )
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.
I want you to go in there
With a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.
You're going to show me your hair?
Actually, I was going to show you my breasts,
But...
Sure, we can do hair.
( Chuckles )
( chuckles softly )
You just made my night.
Go.

( Music stops)
Tomorrow morning, barney's going to send out the package,
And butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.
( laughing )
Oh, hey, dude.
Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey.
So, lil, did you, uh, get the milk?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I got it.
You think you might want to...
Drink the milk?
No.
Nope, I'm good.
I don't need any milk.
Look, guys, I know milk is important...
It's got vitamin a, vitamin d,
It's a great way to start the morning...
But ted just had a huge date.
How'd it go, dude?
I didn't go.
What?
Why?
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.
Why?
She sounds perfect.
I don't want perfect.
I want robin.
Oh, god, not this again.
Ted, it's a mistake.
Maybe.
But it's a mistake I have to make.
Wrong.
It's a mistake you don't have to make.
Look at the evidence.
You and robin have tried this again and again...
Ted:
Here's the thing about mistakes.
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake,
You gotta make it anyway.
Ah, sweet damn that's a hot plate.
Hey, is this milk any good?
( Grunts and spits )
Even really, really dumb mistakes.
( mouse squeaking )
Kids, life is a dark road.
You never really know what's up ahead.
One night you're cruising along enjoying the ride, and then all of a sudden, you're 28.
And for the birthday boy, lasagna.
Thank you.
Careful.
The plate is very hot.
'Kay.
Oh, go on, touch it.
Ah!
Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?
Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.
I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.
You don't have to.
Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.
Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Barney.
Oy, gevalt.
- Ah...
Happy birthday, Ted.
- Whoo-hoo!
Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y...
Oh, my God.
What?
Oh!
Call an ambulance!
- What's going on?
- Try not to speak.
Here, sit down.
Just don't talk, don't talk.
- Is she okay?
- I'm serious, call 911.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
Shh!
Shh!
Just don't move.
Don't move.
Just try...
Here, have some water.
Water!
Here, drink this.
Shh!
Shh!
You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.
Wait for it.

Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.

Oh, thank God, you're here.
What is going on?

I think there might be some internal bleeding.
Probably some fractures.
We got to get her to the hospital.
What are you talking about?
- You've had a terrible fall.
- No, I haven't.
Really?
'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven.
Angel...
Give him your number.
What?
Give him your number.
What?
- Give him your number.
- Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.
- Give him your number.
- What are you...?
Come on.
They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.
- All right!
- It works!
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, everyone.
It's been fun.
It's Wendy the waitress.
Tip her well.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Troilus and Cressida.
Neighborhood Playhouse.
Check them out, they're good.
I realize why I'm still single.
I'm picky.
I'm not going to settle.
If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.
Well, what's perfect?
- It's not like I have a list.

Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...

I know at least...

She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword.
She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine.

I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.
This is stupid.
Stu...
Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills.
I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.
This is a job for me, Barney.
It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it.
Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.
Tracy, could you come in here, please?
Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.
Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...
I get it.
Thank you, Tracy.

She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding
and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl.
All right, fine.
Set it up.
You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?
Will you taste this latte for me?
I think they gave me decaf.
Tastes normal to me.
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.
Oh, God!
It got me as well.
Well, then why did you have me drink it?
!
Because now... you're in.
Okay.
Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you.
But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.
Let's make that bastard pay.
You think that we should brush our teeth first?
Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match.
I was so excited, I got there early.
But before it even started...
Lily?
Hey, Ted, are you busy?
Um... yes.
Oh, right.
Soul mate.
Forgot.
Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?
What?
What?
No.
Can't you just call Marshall?
Marshall can't know about this.
Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story.
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't, I'm waiting...
Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?
No, drifter, no!
Come on, Lily.
But you see my point.
All right, stay there.
I'm on my way.
And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, thank God.
I'm so sorry about this.
Did you get ahold of your date?
Yes.
And was she okay about pushing it back?
Yes.
Because she's perfect.
So what am I doing here?
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.
Ever.
Swear.
Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.
I swear on Luke and Leia.
About a month ago, I started getting insomnia.
Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time.
But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.
Did you talk to Marshall about it?
He wouldn't have understood.
He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot.
So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man...
That was you?
Awesome!
I know!
I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.
And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.
Let me guess.
It's somewhere far away.
San Francisco.
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.
But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good.
This was a way to find out.
And the interview is tonight.
In New Haven.
You don't want to get married.
Of course I want to get married.
I...
It's not like I was ever going to do it.
I just...
I just really wanted to see if I could get this.
Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America.
I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective.
But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall.
I think it's pretty clear what that means.
Okay, I was...
I was having second thoughts.
But I'm not any more.
I...
I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.
I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall.
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do.
Come here.
It's okay.
Look...
Marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.
But why am I the only one?
How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.
All done.
Ted, let's go to New Haven.
Lily, don't do this to yourself.
I just need to know if I can get in.
If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married.
Come on!
It's an adventure.
No, it's not an adventure.
It's a mistake.
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.
But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake,
and look back, and say, "Yep.
That was a mistake."
So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!
I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free.
Does any of this make sense to you?
I don't know.
You said "mistake" a lot.
Lily, don't do this.
Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what?
Lily.
Lily!
Hey, Lily, this is Ted, the guy you left stranded by the side of the road.
I just wanted to say good luck with the interview, remember to pick up some milk...
Oh, and, when I get home, I'm going to kill you.
And, also, I texted you the same thing.
- Hey, I need a big favor.
- Anything, bro.
I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.
No.
It's kind of an emergency.
What are you doing in Duchess County?
Apple picking.
Can you just get up here?
I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work.
We're kind of swamped.
Is that Ted?
Yeah.
He's stuck in Duchess County.
Don't you have a big date tonight?
Uh...
Marshall.
Hi.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
So what are you doing in Duchess County?
Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree?
Damn!
Okay, well, hang on.
I'm coming to get you.
No!
Relax, man.
I'll take the Fiero.
No, no, no.
Just... forget it.
Ha, ha!
A little prank.
I'm not in Duchess County.
So that's the prank?
That you're not in Duchess County?
Yep.
Gotcha!
Classic!
Gotta go.
Hey, check out this one.
It actually looks like Butterfield.
You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously.
Which is great, and everything, but
I can't imagine having this much fun over there.
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?
Maybe.
Don't tell Lily, okay?
Taking off for the night.
Thanks, Tracy.
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?
Of course we are.
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.
Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home.
Need a ride, cowboy?
Sorry.
I don't get in vans with strangers.
Hmm, too bad.
I got candy.
Candy?
!
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?
Nope.
Sworn to secrecy.
Oh, come on.
- I like your hat.
- Right.
This is embarrassing.
I got highlights.
Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice?
- Highlights is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.
I thought it might look cool.
Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean,
"I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat.
- Oh.
I gotta see this.
- No way.
Please.
I bet it doesn't look that bad.
I bet it looks grr-eat!
So, she says, changing the subject.
Big date tonight.
How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?
Kind of amazingly.
Uh, she's 28, like me.
Wow, I'm 28.
Hmm.
Uh, college educated-- check.
Plays tennis-- check.
Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.
I read that.
More like "Love in the Time of Don't Bothera."
You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.
I'm just saying.
We're not indoors.
We're in a van.
Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.
Never.
What else?
- She loves lasagna.
- Barf.
You know, I am sensing a pattern here.
What else?
Let's see what else...
Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.
And she's looking to get married and have kids?
Check and check.
She wants two kids-- a boy and a girl.
Wow.
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.
Really?
You don't want kids?
You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you.
Hey.
I'm driving.
Look at that. 8:56.
You're early.
Hey, thanks for picking me up.
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.
Thanks.
All right, you've clearly had a rough night.
I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.
You're going to show me your hair?
Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.
You just made my night.
Go.
Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice.
- Oh, hey, dude.
- Hey, guys.
Hi.
Hey.
So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I got it.
You think you might want to... drink the milk?
No.
Nope, I'm good.
I don't need any milk.
Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date.
How'd it go, dude?
I didn't go.
What?
Why?
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.
Why?
She sounds perfect.
I don't want perfect.
I want Robin.
Oh, God, not this again.
Ted, it's a mistake.
Maybe.
But it's a mistake I have to make.
Wrong.
It's a mistake you don't have to make.
Look at the evidence.
You and Robin have tried this again and again...
Here's the thing about mistakes.
Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway.
Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.
Hey, is this milk any good?
Even really really dumb mistakes.
Jonathan, hurry
Jonathan Kang
Jonathan, hurry up
Hurry!
Wait for me
I'm waiting
Wait!
Waiting already!
Don't run like that, it's dangerous!
Shane
Do you still remember?
Our relationship started from an order.
Ever since I saw you,
I knew you were different from anyone else.
But I was not brave.
Not brave enough to stand by you.
Who can tell me what planet we live on?
Earth
That's right.
Earth is a planet
Planets rotate around stars
So, our sun is a star
Ms. Lee, here's the new transfer student
All right, thank you
Everybody, this is the new transfer student from Taipei
Let's give her a warm welcome
You can sit over there for now
We'll ask her to introduce herself later
Ok, back to class
Besides stars and planets, there is also the comet
Every time a comet visits our solar system, it brings unexpected surprises
When a comet visits, it usually brings a beautiful spectacle what we call, shooting stars
And what do we do when we see a shooting star?
Jonathan, have you ever been to Taipei?
Hush That's right, we make a wish
We wish for mommy and daddy's health or to become a good student
Everyone can make his own wish
Remember that
Shane Yu, what are you doing?
Both of you, stand up!
The rabbit hops and hops... then it runs off and disappears...
Ia la la la la la la
The rabbit...
Stop stop stop!
Stop looking outside
Shane Yu scared the new student so much that her family decided to transfer again
If you don't behave, you will be punished too like Shane
Stop looking outside
Let's repeat the song 3 2 1 sing!
The rabbit hops and hops... then it runs off and disappears...
The rabbit boasts...
I'm the fastest...
He's very naughty and gets into trouble all the time
I sent him to see the doctors before
The doctor suggested that if he can pair up with another student, it will help to modify his behavior and he won't feel like making trouble all the time
Everybody stand!
Attention!
Salute!
Good morning, teacher
Sit down
Jonathan Kang, Ms. Lee wants to see you in her office
Please do your best for him
Thank you so much
Thank you, I'll be leaving now
You're welcome Thanks again
Yes teacher?
Come here
I want you to do something for me
Teacher knows that you are a good student
And Shane... well...
I would like to ask you to become his little guardian angel to help him, and become friends with him
This way, I believe very soon
Shane will become a good student like you
Will you do this for me?
Every time I face a challenge and feel defeated, my friend will say to me
Good morning
Tell me, what is your problem?
Let me help you
Every time I hear this, my courage comes back to me
I am no longer scared, I am no longer defeated
No matter how great the difficulty, I will not run away
His words are as strong as shoulders
Can I join in with you guys?
Draw the portrait of the student sitting across from you
Can I join your group?
Using your crayon.
Can I join in?
Some students are doing very well.
Shane, why aren't you in a group?
Does anyone want Shane in their group?
Anyone?
Yes, teacher, I volunteer to pair up with Shane
Ok, Jonathan, you pair up with Shane then
Jonathan Kang, you are my best friend
Huang Chiwen, 78
Those with less than 80, go to the front of the class
Jonathan Kang, 67
Shame on you, class monitor, you've dropped so much
Li Hanjue, 84
I am not here to punish you but you've really done too poorly
How can you feel good about yourself with these grades?
How can you let me down?
I have guided you through these questions again and again in class
The same questions on this exam and you can't even get a B
Don't you know how much effort I've spent on you
And this is the result?
You know, Jonathan?
If you add my mark with yours, we make a perfect 100
Since then,
I never stop wondering if I were brave enough... to say No to the teacher.
What kind of Me will become?
Will I gain more, or lose more?
Jonathan Kang
Jonathan Kang
Wake up!
Jonathan
Jonathan
I'm coming
Jonathan
Jonathan
Jonathan
Jonathan
Hush, my family's still asleep
Hurry up, or you'll be late for school
All right all right!
Oh, so you're HERE!
What?
Why are you looking depressed like that?
Nothing, I'm just hanging
You know?
My game went so bad after you left
Like it has anything to do with me
What are you doing?
Breaktime is over
Come on, let's go
What are you doing?
Go away!
Carrie, you can't just come to Taiwan impromptu
Your dad will be worried
Why weren't you worried when you dumped me in Hong Kong?
What was that?
Why weren't you worried when you dumped me by myself in Hong Kong?
I did not dump you by yourself in Hong Kong
You've got your dad and Auntie there
Beside, you chose to go to Hong Kong in the first place
Oh all right, just eat
Good morning
Good morning
Ok, everybody, you can rest
Before I start my speech today
I would like to ask a student to come on stage
Senior class B, Miss Carrie Tu
Carrie Tu, come up to the stage
Carrie, do you know why you are different from all the other students?
Please take a good look at Miss Tu and why she is different from you all
Fine.
Since you do not know the answer
Let me tell you by making her the same as the rest of you
Quiet!
In the future, I hope that every student will follow exactly the school regulations on wardrobe and hair
Carrie Tu, return to class
Are you ok?
It's not a big deal.
The hair will grow back
Don't think too much about it
Um
Um...
Jonathan
Wanna skip school and go to Taipei?
Where to?
Wait wait wait
Do you have enough?
Yeah, should be
Ok, should be enough
Where to?
Two tickets to Taipei
I wanted to ask you...
Don't peak, go away!
Sorry, sorry, sorry...
I just wanted to ask
What?
What if our school finds out?
They won't
Don't peak
Oh right
Cover me
Hush
Let me see, let me see
You look nice
OK?
Jonathan, How many girlfriends did you have?
Never, And you?
So many
No way
Let's go
Let's stay in Taipei tonight?
Wait for me
Hush
How to begin
You first, take off your clothes
Theory of sex
My god, you're so slow
No, I'm not.
Hurry, let's go
Hold on for me
Jonathan, you know what?
What?
Which university are you planning to go to?
You're not getting into any university, why do you ask?
But I made it to highschool this far
You just go lucky
Maybe I'll be lucky again this time
Takes a miracle for you to pass the exam
If I can help the school team win the championship
I'll be recommended to university, regardless of the exam
Fine then
I'll flunk the exam, and you can go to university all by yourself
Why do you say things like that?
Sit tight
What?
Didn't we agree to go to the same university together?
We'll see
Why do you say that?
Look
Oie ole!
Who was that?
Nobody, none of your business
Says who?
Don't go after her!
Why not?
Stop it, Shane
You don't know her anyway
Shane, come on!
Let's go, stop goofing around
Stop it, Shane!
Stop it!
Shane, let's go
Shane, let's go
Let's go, Shane
Shane, let's go
Shane, let's go
Why did you do that?
It's dangerous
Why did you provoke her?
I did not!
What's up with you?
You don't even know her
It's just for fun, nobody's hurt
Just fun
What fun?
Jonathan, let's go get a drink
Her Chinese is funny, she's from Hong Kong?
Aren't you guys sitting a little too close?
Not at all
Jonathan, come sit over here
Ok
You stay, I'll move
So, how did you two meet?
The school paper
School paper, that's so lame
I'm leaving
Carrie
She's weird
What?
Really!
You're such an ass!
Did you prepare for the English exam?
Yeah, so?
You eat first, don't wait for me
Ok
I haven't even started reviewing
You're kidding!
What are you going to do?
Help me then
How can I help you, I don't understand it myself
What are you going to do?
Use notes
Don't get me involved again
Have some more
Thank you
Jonathan, eat some more
Ok, thanks
Don't be shy
Mom
I'm going upstairs
It's ok, you go ahead and eat
Oh, ok
Just leave it, I'll wash up
I'll take care of it
Ok, thank you, I'll go upstairs now
Just leave it there
Shane, didn't you say you wanted to study?
"Shane, didn't you say you wanted to study?"
What?
If you're not going to study, I'm leaving
Jonathan, Carrie's here
What are you doing here?
Nothing, I'm just bored
Jonathan...
Yeah?
Can I ask you something?
What?
That good friend of yours...
Yu...
Shane Yu
Yeah, Shane
Are you in love with him?
We're just really good friends
Don't you want to tell him?
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone
Carrie,
I'm so sorry
Did you see Jonathan?
Nah
Anybody see Jonathan?
Nah
Oh well, thanks
Did you...
Forget it, it's nothing
Hey!
Hey!
I didn't see him
Oh
If you want to go, just go
Hey...
Stop looking, let's go
Excuse me, give me a way
Are you all right?
No big deal
Where's the school nurse?
I don't know, not here yet
Oh
Why did you disappear?
Well,
I just got bored
What were you and that girl talking about?
I said what were you and that girl talking about?
Nothing really
Why do you care?
Why won't you tell me?
Tell you what?
It's not important
If it's not important why can't you tell me?
Just small talk
Are you going to tell me or not?
I don't want to
Fine, she was just saying that...
I don't want to hear anymore
Shane
Shane
Get on the bus, we have to get to the game
Hurry
Excuse me
Shit, it's raining!
I have to get some things
Why did you come see me play?
I had nothing else to do
Are you here to do an interview for the school paper?
Hey!
Where are you going?
Will you stop following me!
Who's following who?
I'm just here for my stuff
Then just get your stuff and go!
Why are you going in there?
That's not the exit
Just mind your own business and stay away from me, ok?
Don't go inside other people's classrooms
Let me go!
Be reasonable!
I'm just trying to be polite, why are you throwing a temper?
It's all because of you!
What does it have to do with me?
I just knew you for a few days, and you're yelling at...
Sorry
I didn't mean to say those things
I got dumped recently
Carrie
How did you get to know Jonathan?
The school paper, I talked to him first
Why didn't he tell me that?
He needs not tell you everything
I know that
Does he like you?
I don't think so
Then, what are we?
What are we what
What do you think we are?
What do you think what?
Be my girlfriend?
What girlfriend?
You don't understand?
Girlfriend, be together, girlfriend boyfriend
If you get into university, I'll be your girlfriend
Are you rejecting me?
You know my grades suck
Yes, I'm rejecting you
Anyway, if you can get into university, we'll be together
Look
How about you?
So you'll settle for private university?
I can always cram for re-exam at the same time
Jonathan, wake up!
Wake up, wakie!
Jonathan
Jonathan
I'm coming
My god, you're finally awake
You've been studying late?
Yeah, surprise surprise
I'm having the first practice, can you come with me?
Why should I accompany you?
I've got another exam to review for tonight
Please
Just come for a little bit No
Hold that for me
Jonathan,
I'll see you after class
Time's up, pass the exam papers forward
Stop writing, pass it forward
Put down your pen, and pass the papers forward
Sorry
No problem
You just finished?
Yeah, I was just hanging loose, now I'm waiting for Jonathan really?
He's coming out, bye!
Jonathan!
Hey...
Hey, didn't you hear me?
Why are you ignoring me?
I'm not
No?
Then come eat with me, I'm starving
You know,
My senior jawed me today
Why?
There are these girls who come and watch me play
Yeah right
Our faculty is organizing a ball, wanna come?
We'll see
That girl's hot
Not like the girls in my class, so big and muscular
They could probably kill me with one slap on the face
There's a nice girl in my class
You like her
Uh
Oh
It's so hot today
Didn't we agree to meet for lunch, why weren't you there?
I even went to your class to look for you
Hey!
What?
I'm talking to you
Didn't we agree to meet for lunch?
Stop cramming, let's chat
Hey!
Not again
I have an exam to study
Then why didn't you meet me for lunch?
I was busy, ok!
Stay over on that side
You're ignoring me
Shane
Earthquake
I can't get through
Me neither
I'll use the pay phone
Mom, are you all right?
Shane, are you all right?
Oh, yeah
I'm with Jonathan
Then you be careful
I'll help you clean up the stuff tomorrow
All right, I'll be careful
Nothing more to add, bye
What's this?
News photography, my new assignment
Title:
Capturing the real world
Real like what?
The professor didn't say exactly, don't touch!
The professor didn't tell us what to photograph
He just said, photograph whatever you want
Then why not call it "Photograph whatever you want"?
Shane
Yeah?
Don't you think we should tell Jonathan about us?
Why?
I just feel like I'm lying to him when I see him
Maybe not right now
Wait until he finishes his exams
Oh
Why did you call me?
I'm so bored, hang out with me
I have to go to cram school
Let's go
I have an exam
Let's go
Go
Carrie
Jonathan, are you home?
Jonathan
Carrie
Cheer up!
Why is it pouring like this suddenly?
Move over
Move over a little
Carrie just called while we were riding the bike
You've been hanging out with her recently?
So...
you're like boyfriend girlfriend?
Look, I'm sorry
I know Carrie used to be your girlfriend but then she started to come see me play ball
I know you guys were together before
The school paper thing
I didn't go out with her in highschool
She said she would only go out with me if I make it to university
Shane
I need to ask you something, and I want you to give me an honest answer
Carrie is my good friend
Do you really like her, or are you just toying with her?
I really like her
I wanted to tell you before but I know you're preparing for exams
I was worried that it would affect you
If you give me another chance
I would tell you right away
I'm going, why don't you go see her?
Jonathan, what is it?
What are you?
Jonathan!
Hello?
Shane.
What?
Slow down
How did he find out?
Uh
A new message
Hello, Jonathan?
This is Shane
You turned off your phone
I couldn't reach you
Anyway
I just want to let you know
I'm sorry, I really didn't mean it
You're really important to me
Anyway, please call me when you get this message
Jonathan,
What?
sit down
Our faculty ball is tonight, you wanna come?
Shane, are you coming with us, or getting there yourself?
I don't think I'll go after all
Why not?
You said you would
Why not all of a sudden?
Party's no fun if you're not there
Jonathan's busy tonight
I have to take him home
What?
We're still going even if we have to work tonight
Let's all go together
Yeah, you go, I'll go home by myself
See?
He can take care of himself
You should come with us
Come on
Stop being so...
Stop being so anal, just come
You're so anal sometimes It's going to be fun
Fine, how about this then?
What?
Yeah, what?
I'll go if Jonathan goes

Come, it's going to be fun Don't be a party pooper
Please, I beg you
Please come

The turtle races against the hare, and the pig is the referee
Who wins?
tortoise
You're a pig yourself
No you are, pig!
My friend's here, I'll be right back
Ok, later
Why do you look so bored?
Nothing, you go have fun
We'll have fun together
Carrie's joining us later
How about if we play a game?
What game?
Those girls over there was just teaching me a
"Choose one out of two" game
You have to choose one out of the two
Or you have to tell the truth
I don't want to play
Come on
I don't want to play
I don't care, I'll start first anyway
Your dad or your mom?
Both
You have to choose one
My mom
Hair or eyebrows?
Whose?
Yours, of course
Hair
Tits or ass?
Ass
Brains or body?
Brains
Liar!
You think I don't know the real answer to that?
Now it's your turn to ask me
Nah
Just ask
I don't know what to ask
All right all right all right
Black or white?
What?
Black or white?
Black
Fruit or cake?
Fruit
Cat or dog?
Dog
Go on!
Ok, let me think
Bring it on
Me or Carrie?
What?
I'm going to the washroom
Where's Jonathan?
Jonathan
Shane, Carrie, I'm busy tomorrow, I have to go
What's up with you?
Nothing, you guys have fun
I'm busy tomorrow, I have to go
What do you want me to do?
I really have to study for tomorrow!
And so many other things, I'm really busy
There's so much to do, I have to go
If you go, Carrie's going to think you're upset
It's been so long the three of us can get together and have some fun, why do you have to act this way?
Shane, I mean it
We don't have to be with each other all the time
You've got your life;
I've got mine
It's all the same for me
It'not a problem at all
Besides, aren't we best friends?
What can't you tell me?
Are you hiding something from me?
Best friends?
Fine, let me tell you this
I...
I never volunteered to be your friend
The teacher forced me to
I never wanted to be friends!
Hello?
Yes,
That's right, I know him
Keys
Let's go
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Are you drunk or something?
What the hell are you doing?
Are you losing your head?
Shane, are you messing with me?
Hello?
Is this Carrie?
This is Jonathan
Shane is at my place now.
Do you want to come here?
Can you promise me one thing
No matter what happens
You guys have to always stay together
You're awake
Where's Jonathan?
I don't know.
He called me this morning and told me you're here
So I came
And he was gone already
You can't see the ocean in Taipei
You know?
What?
When I was a child, I was the kind everybody hated
You still are
I'm serious
I was a real troublemaker
One time, I don't know why, I suddenly took a pair of scissors and cut the hair of the girl sitting in front of me
The teacher was so furious
You know what she did to me?
She sent me and my desk and chair to the middle of the field and forbid me from having class with the others
Everybody was scared to be my friend
Even now, I'm still afraid of that feeling
Then Jonathan came along
No matter what trouble I got myself into
He would still stick with me
He was my only friend
Then you came along
I cannot lose any one of you
We've really grown up
When you grow up, everything changes
Is this Carrie?
Where did you get the car?
Some senior on the team
Drive carefully then
Don't crash the car
Taking trains is more convenient
Why must you insist on driving?
Since we're traveling south
Better to drive than queue for train tickets
You can book tickets online now, there's no need to queue
Shane, where are we?
Why did you bring us here?
Shane Yu
Shane
Jonathan
Yeah?
Wanna take a walk?
I'm going then
You really don't want to go?
You go, I'll wait for you guys in the car
You know?
I've been thinking...
Maybe I'm too used to having Jonathan by my side
Too used to having both of you to take care of me
Carrie, will we lose each other in the future?
Did I mess everything up?
Am I the one who messes everything up?
Hey,
Shane
I think we should not see each other anymore
What?
I mean
It's not your fault
It's my own problem
Let's not see each other anymore
I mean it
There are so many things you don't know
Shane
What are you doing?
Stop fighting!
No, stop it!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
What is it?
Stop fighting!
Just say it, ok!
I'll wait in the car
Um... sorry
I shouldn't say it like that
I just want to know if you really meant what you said
I don't know
What do you mean you don't know?
I...
Aren't we best friends?
What can't you tell me?
Shane
You say best friends can tell each other anything
Fine
Then I really want to know if you'll still be my friend after you hear my secret
Shane
You're not just a friend to me
I really love you
Wait!
I have a secret for you too
Mrs. Yu
Please don't worry too much
Your son's attention deficit disorder can be modified through group interaction help him find some children to pair up with him or arrange a student to be his friend
That way
I believe his condition will slowly improve
I always knew you were forced by the teacher
I always knew you didn't volunteer to be my friend
At first, I wanted to hurt you and get you in trouble too
But then I realized that I couldn't do it
I'm really too lonely
Jonathan Kang
You really are my best friend
Brought to you by JSS Jumong Subbing Squad
Sir.
What is it?
Prince Dae-So sent a letter to the chief of each clan.
He's inviting each clan chief to Ju-Mong's wedding.
Prince Ju-Mong is getting married?
Yes.
What should I say to Miss?
Prince Dae-So invited Yang-Jeong of the Han Nation, and all chiefs of the surrounding clans.
Prince Dae-So invited all the chiefs so he could display that the power is in his hands and not in His Majesty's.
It's very clear that if we don't go he will cause us a problem.
So Seo-No is pregnant, so Oo-Tae should go.
The chief of GyehRu is So Seo-No.
Tell all this to So Seo-No.
Let her make the decision.
Yes.
You go on the merchandizing journey to Ok-Jeo.
This will be a very important journey for GyehRu's future.
I know it will be difficult, but do your best.
Yes, Chief.
Aunt, I want you, with Chan-Soo to take the other group to Chang'an, after entering Hyeon-To City.
Our group was kicked out of Hyeon-To City
You want me to go to Hyeon-To City again?
Even to an enemy you can sell our goods.
That's a true salesman's attitude.
Chang'an and Hyeon-To City are important areas for our group.
I'll grade you and Chan-Soo on your results.
If you fail, you won't have a job here.
Go and do your work.
Miss!
Chief!
I will take care of everything here, so go in and rest.
If you work too hard, something might happen to you.
I am okay.
Don't worry.
How can I not worry?
You have a child that will grow up to lead GyehRu.
I don't want to take a chance.
Go inside.
Go inside.
Go inside.
Are you worrying about something?
No.
I'll pour one glass.
My Lady
Prince Ju-Mong will have a wedding ceremony.
Prince Dae-So invited the clan chiefs.
You should go as the chief of GyehRu, but you are pregnant so I'll go.
I will go.
I don't want Prince Dae-So to think that I didn't go using the excuse of pregnancy.
After I give my congratulations for the marriage,
I will cut off all my memories.
I'll go.
It upsets me that Prince Dae-So is using your wedding for political gain.
Even so, it won't diminish the meaning of your wedding.
Ju-Mong
Yes.
To succeed your ambition, to build a country, the road to your future will be difficult.
But, even though it is difficult, you cannot use this as an excuse to make Yesoya unhappy.
I'll keep that in mind.
After you saved my Ju-Mong's life, and came to BuYeo, you became like my daughter.
You don't need to show formal propriety and see me as a mother-in-law.
Think of me as your own mother.
I will do my best to be good to the Prince and you.
Your Majesty,
Prince Ju-Mong is here.
Ah...
let him in.
Sit down.
How are the wedding plans?
Dae-So is using my ceremony for his gain, but he will trust me more afterwards.
All the humiliation and difficulties you experienced will be over soon.
It seems the moment you've been waiting for is almost here.
You got Dae-So's trust, but you cannot relax since you still have so much to do.
Yes, Your Majesty
After the wedding, take Yesoya to Mt.
Jun-Mu.
Hae Mo-Su was buried there.
I didn't bury him.
I left him there for the eagles to eat his body.
Hae Mo-Su left a will to be eaten by eagles and to fly over his old country.
That was his wish.
You won't see his remains, but his spirit will be there.
Welcome.
It's been a long time.
Father.
Have you been well?
Congratulations on this celebration for BuYeo.
Welcome.
I drink and drink, but I don't get drunk.
Same with me.
This is a happy day, so why do I feel so empty?
Did you see that So Seo-No is here?
So Seo-No, the way she looked...
-So Seo-No's eyes...
-Stop!
Don't talk about it.
Those two, what a terrible fate.
Did you call me?
His Majesty told me that General Hae Mo-Su is buried at Mt.
Jun-Mu.
Lead me there.
What's wrong?
Your Highness, kill me.
What is it?
After the funeral, the Han Nation cut off our salt.
Prince Dae-So went to Hyeon-To City.
Prince Dae-So came back secretly.
Prince Dae-So and Na-Ru threatened me to tell where General Hae Mo-Su was buried.
Why did brother Dae-So want to know that?
I was curious so I went there.
Say it.
Prince Dae-So took General Hae Mo-Su's head to Yang-Jeong.
This resolved the salt problem, and he got his salt.
I gave in because of Prince Dae-So and Na-Ru's threat.
I should die because of this crime.
Please kill me.
I did not bury him.
I left him there for the eagles to eat his body.
Hae Mo-Su left a will to be eaten by eagles and to fly over his old country.
That was his wish.
You won't see his remains, but his spirit will be there.
Ju-Mong.
I had this great ambition.
But, the promise I made to a woman, I couldn't keep.
You shouldn't live like that.
When you can't keep even one woman safe, how can you keep a country at peace?
Your mother... must be wise and beautiful.
You must protect her.
Father.
Father, you said you have good news for your son-in-law.
Tell us.
It's good news for BuYeo but bad news for the Han Nation.
What is it?
Soon Jin-Beon and Yim-Doon will merge with Nak-Lang.
Is that true?
Yes, it's all because of the war.
Jin-Beon and Yim-Doon don't have governors.
The people don't have a government.
The capital blames me for this.
The situation is difficult for me.
I'm sorry.
There is one way I can avoid the responsibility.
The JoSeon refugees who came to BuYeo, from Jin-Beon and Yim-Doon.
I'd like to send them to Chang'an as slaves.
As you promised, round up the refugees and send them to Hyeon-To City right away.
These people have already settled in BuYeo.
What would the people think of me if I sent them as slaves?
Please understand me.
If you gain one you should give one back.
My life is on it.
Drink it.
My Lady, you should try to convince him one more time.
If I lose the people's heart, it would be terrible for my situation.
Your Royal Highness, I advise you to do what my father said.
To me, it's harder to gain the heart the Han Nation's King than the peoples' heart.
Because of this incident, if you gain the King of Han Nation's heart, nothing would be more beneficial.
I wonder if Dae-So will follow my will.
Don't worry,
I told him it's an opportunity to gain the heart of the Han Nation's King.
He seemed agreeable.
You will get your wish.
How is Ju-Mong?
He is loyal to Dae-So I heard.
Yes.
Dae-So seems to trust Ju-Mong, but I don't.
Do you have a reason to not trust Ju-Mong?
Prince Ju-Mong is not Dae-So's real brother.
What are you saying?
Ju-Mong is not King Geum-Wa's son
What?
Then, who is his father?
His real father is Hae Mo-Su.
Your Highness, it's Na-Ru.
Come in.
His Royal Highness wants to see you.
Did you call me?
Welcome.
Did you have a good dream last night?
I guess I was stressed with the ceremony.
I didn't have a dream.
Is that so?
Ju-Mong.
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
Yang-Jeong said he wants to send the refugees as slaves to the Han Nation.
I went against it but it's the Han Nation's King's request.
Jin-beon and Yim-Doon will be abolished because of the war.
If we don't send the refugees to them as slaves, they will get upset.
Then we might have to have another war with the Han Nation.
Please help me.
You will be in charge of separating the refugees from the people.
Is there any other way than to send them, the refugees?
Tell me if you have another solution.
The last war we had was to save those refugees.
Now if you send those refugees back, how many soldiers died in vain?
Since they settled in our country, they mixed well.
It won't be easy to pick them out.
If you don't do it right, people will resent us.
I spent a great deal of time thinking about this but there is no other way.
If we refuse the Han Nation's request, our stable relationship will break apart.
I agree with you.
Prince Ju-Mong is in charge of separating the refugees from the people.
All of you help Ju-Mong as much as you can.
Yes, Your Royal highness.
Stupid boy!
He has no pride.
Your Majesty, do we have to just watch?
If they do what the Han Nation requests, the war you had with the Han Nation will be for nothing.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but Ju-Mong will be in charge of picking out the refugees.
What did Ju-Mong say?
He agreed to do it.
Your Majesty.
Did you want to see me?
Are you in charge of picking out the refugees?
It was brother Dae-So's order.
Are you really going to do it?
Mother.
If I refuse, someone else will have to.
It won't stop sending the refugees to the Han Nation.
Trust me, I will take care of it and don't worry.
Are you really going to send the refugees to the Han Nation?
!
You should save the refugees instead.
How can you do this?
!
Say something!
Are you really going to do what Dae-So says?
No!
You cannot do this!
The reason you got all the humiliation from Dae-So over the years was because you had a plan to save the refugees.
If you do this, then we cannot serve you any longer.
Then, all of you leave me.
Your Highness.
No, he's not the same master we served.
I'd rather die by the hands of Han soldiers.
How can we send refugees to them?
!
Hey, is it true?
Prince Ju-Mong will send the refugees to the Han Nation?
Yes.
Nonsense.
You have the wrong information.
It cannot be true.
It cannot be true!
Leader.
It's true even though it's hard to believe.
I too trusted our Prince.
It seems he became the right arm to Prince Dae-So.
We are going to leave our Prince.
Something is strange.
What is?
He's not going to do that.
If he made that decision, there must be another reason.
I know the reason.
It's very clear.
He is tired by now of all the things he had to go through.
His Majesty protected him before, but now His Majesty doesn't have power.
His beloved So Seo-No is married to another man.
He lost all his ambition.
He is seeking an easy life now.
You idiot!
What do you think of our Prince?
If that's not it, what's the problem?
Leader.
Your Highness.
As you wish, we are leaving.
Thank you for everything.
Take care of yourselves.
Truly, he's so cold.
We're going to separate like this?
Don't cry you fool.
I feel a lot better.
It's a good thing.
It's a good thing!
From now on, we'll get the refugees that settled in BuYeo.
You should be careful not to hurt BuYeo people.
Complete this task quickly and efficiently.
Yes!
Let's go.
Yes.
Don't miss anyone.
Hurry!
Catch him.
Yes.
-Oh-Yi!
-Oh-Yi!
Stop this.
Don't make commotion.
Let's go.
Welcome.
You are working hard.
Under Prince Ju-Mong's supervision, our task is going well.
How much progress did you make?
We got about 200 refugees.
Originally there were almost 1,000 refugees who came to BuYeo.
Many went into the mountains.
Some already heard the news and ran out of BuYeo.
It's impossible to gather them all.
How many do you think we can send to the Han Nation?
500 plus.
That's good enough.
I know it is a difficult task.
Push harder.
You do this, then I will never forget it.
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
It's been a long time.
Yes.
After So Seo-No's and Ju-Mong's relationship ended,
I thought I would never see you again.
I thought that too.
But what brought you here?
What is it?
I... left BuYeo.
Miss, it's Sa-Young.
Come in.
What is it?
Ju-Mong is sending refugees to the Han Nation.
You are mistaken.
I heard it from Hyeop-Bo, who left Ju-Mong to settle here.
Ju-Mong had a war to save the refugees.
Isn't it strange that he would pick out the refugees and send them to the Han Nation?
It seems it's time for Prince Ju-Mong to leave BuYeo.
What does that have to do with the refugees going to the Han Nation?
So Seo-No.
Yes.
Ju-Mong is Hae Mo-Su's son.
The Han Nation is the enemy of Hae Mo-Su and Ju-Mong.
He won't send the refugees to the Han.
He must have another plan.
He's going to live in GyehRu, so please be kind to him.
I heard you are a strong man.
Yes, I am strong.
Then guard the journey of the merchants.
I'll do my best.
Your Highness.
How could you do this to us?
Your Highness, how could you think of sending us to the Han Nation as slaves?
General Hae Mo-Su would be very upset.
Shut up!
Take them away.
Yes!
How's it going with the refugee matter?
Ju-Mong is doing very well.
I heard that, but he changed so much that I feel uneasy.
Don't worry he's very loyal to me.
I don't doubt him anymore.
It's fortunate that I didn't send him to the Han Nation as a hostage.
People resent the government about this matter but fortunately it's directed towards Ju-Mong.
Prince Ju-Mong acts as a shield for His Royal highness.
Yes, Ju-Mong doesn't care about what people say.
He's working hard for me.
You don't need to doubt him any more.
Your Majesty, Ju-Mong is here.
Come in.
Sit down.
You have a plan?
Yes.
Tell me.
I will leave BuYeo with the refugees.
Is it possible?
Dae-So trusts me.
It won't be a difficult task.
Where would you go?
I haven't decided.
I'll find a place where Dae-So can't reach me.
I'll establish a site and train an army that I will call Da-Mul Army to be able to fight the Han.
Your Majesty.
Please help me.
I understand.
You gathered the refugees for this reason?
Yes.
Dae-So used his army to help me.
Mother, be ready to leave with me.
What's wrong?
How can I leave His Majesty, who lost everything?
Mother, if you stay here, Dae-So won't protect you.
If you stay here, it will be very difficult for me to leave.
My Lady.
I... will leave BuYeo soon.
I'll take the refugees and not come back.
Does His Majesty and mother know?
I told them.
We will also leave soon, so you must be ready.
Odd.
Just a minute.
Even.
It's odd!
I'm very sorry.
You cheated.
Stop!
Leave.
I need to talk to you.
We have nothing to say to you.
Let's go.
Oh-Yi, Mari.
I need your help.
Truly, you're going to leave BuYeo with the refugees.
I know you're very upset.
I didn't want you to do that dirty work.
Your Highness.
If it's not too late, help me.
Without you, I cannot succeed.
With our stupidity, we didn't trust you.
I'm sorry.
Where is Hyeop-Bo?
He went to GyehRu.
We don't have much time, send a person to bring him back.
Yes.
Are you ready to leave?
I am gathering more refugees.
I will tell Dae-So I will extradite the refugees, but once we're out of BuYeo, we will go our own way.
Dae-So would give you that responsibility of extradition?
For this purpose, I've done everything that he's asked me.
He won't doubt me, so I hope he will accept my request.
Your Majesty.
I have another thing to talk to you about.
Are you talking about Lady Yoo-Hwa?
I'm sorry.
My mother wouldn't be able to tell you that she's leaving.
Forgive me to ask you this.
Take her with you and leave.
Did you call me?
Sit down.
Your Majesty, you haven't completely recovered yet.
Try not to drink so much.
I am drinking lightly.
Don't be too hard on me.
My Lady.
Yes.
We met a few decades ago.
You went through so much difficulty.
Your father and entire clan were killed.
You met Hae Mo-Su 20 years after you thought he was dead.
Then soon after you had to give him a funeral.
Against the Queen and Dae-So, you had so much humiliation to keep Ju-Mong safe.
I can imagine how terrible it was for you.
Your Majesty, why are you suddenly talking of such things?
After you endured all those days, it's about time to live comfortably.
I couldn't do anything for you.
I became such a burden to you.
Your Majesty.
I sent Hae Mo-Su away, who was my lifelong friend
I couldn't keep you and Ju-Mong very happy either.
Forgive me.
Leave BuYeo with Ju-Mong.
Your Majesty.
If you stay here, you will be in danger.
Your Majesty, I can't leave you.
I'll stay with you and if I die, I'll die by your side.
My Lady...
Ju-Mong can't leave BuYeo if you don't go with him.
Ju-Mong has Yesoya, his adopted brothers, and the refugees.
But if I leave you, you have no one.
My Lady.
I told you there must be something else.
At least he should have told us.
I resent that.
Understand it.
It was so very important to keep it a secret.
OK
Mu-Duek leaves too?
Fool.
Of course she does!
Where did he say he's going?
He did not tell us yet.
Why worry?
I'm sure he has a plan.
Of course.
He always has a plan.
You must get ready.
We'll leave soon.
Don't worry.
I'll take the secret of the strong sword with me.
I was going to settle here, but Oh-Yi and Mari called me back.
Something must have happened.
Take care of yourself.
Yes.
Sa-Yong, if it's not a big deal, then I'll come right back, so take care.
Go inside.
Set up a meeting of managers.
What's the matter?
Song-Yang wants us to pay tax to BuYeo.
What do they want us to send?
200 horses, 500 rolls of silk, grain, and tiger fur.
Those bastards!
They want us to be destroyed?
It's impossible for us to gather all that with our situation.
He knows we can't get all that.
He must have another reason for us to do that.
He's looking for a way to destroy us.
He wants an excuse.
If that doesn't succeed, he will try to destroy us in another way.
Write Song-Yang that we can't do this.
It's not wise to go against him.
First show we are getting ready, then see what he would say.
What Song-Yang wants is for GyehRu to merge with BiRyu.
Because we can't get these things ready, he can't ask us to merge with them.
He's targeting you.
Yeon Che-Ryeong and her crew are returning to GyehRu.
With this opportunity, I will take So Seo-No down from her position as chief.
Yeon Che-Ryeong's son, Chan-Soo, would then become chief.
Chief, I'll do as you ask.
Na-Ru.
Yes, Your Highness.
You can stop gathering refugees.
Yes.
I heard you worked hard.
I only take orders from His Royal Highness.
My father would be very happy, too.
Once you had a war to save the refugees, but now you are trying hard to send them to the Han Nation as slaves.
I'm curious as to what changed your mind.
It was Dae-So's order and I followed it.
That's all.
Hao-Chen.
Yes.
It bothers me.
Watch Prince Ju-Mong.
I understand.
Your Royal Highness.
Welcome.
We gathered all the refugees we could.
Good job.
Then we must get ready to send the refugees to Hyeon-To City.
Your Royal Highness.
Say it.
I want to finish this matter.
Give me an order to extradite the refugees to Hyeon-To City.
You worked hard.
I can give that job to Na-Ru so you can rest.
It's OK.
I started and I want to finish it.
I want to show you my loyalty.
If that's what you want, go ahead and do it.
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

Thank you for watching with us!
Wootae.
What is it?
Prince Daeso has contacted all the chiefs of Jolbon.
He's invited them to Prince Jumong's wedding.
Prince Jumong is getting married?
Yes.
Lady Sosuhno will be upset...
He's invited Yangjung, as well as leaders of all the surrounding nations.
He probably did so to show them... that he rules Puyo, not King Kumwa.
If we don't comply, he'll make a big deal out of it.
Since Lady Sosuhno is pregnant...
Wootae should go instead.
Sosuhno is chief of Keru.
Tell her everything and let her decide.
OK.
Drop by Haengin then go straight to Okjuh.
The profit you make on this trip means a lot to our survival.
It won't be easy but do your best.
I will, my Lady.
Auntie.
Take Chansoo and go to Hyunto then the Han Capital.
We were banished from Hyunto.
You want us to go back?
A merchant should be able to trade even with an enemy.
Hyunto and the Capital are very important markets.
What happens to you depends on the results of the trip.
Your troop leader title is on the line here.
Get going.
Miss!
I mean, my Lady.
I'll take care of everything.
Go inside and get some rest.
What if something goes wrong?
I'm fine.
Don't worry.
How can I not worry?
You're pregnant with our future chief.
We can't take any chances.
Go inside.
Go inside.
Now.
Is something troubling you?
No.
Let me pour you a drink.
Sosuhno.
Prince Jumong is getting married.
Prince Daeso invited leaders of all the surrounding nations and tribes.
You should go to represent Keru... but you're pregnant so I'll go instead.
I'll go.
I don't want Prince Daeso to think I'm using my pregnancy to stay away.
Attending the wedding... will help me get over the feelings I still have for him.
I'll go.
I don't like how Prince Daeso's using your wedding to his advantage... but it won't do you any harm.
Jumong.
Yes?
You have a mission to accomplish... and the road ahead will be rough.
But no matter what happens on the way... don't make Yesoya unhappy.
I promise I won't.
I've thought of you as my daughter... ever since he brought you to Puyo.
Don't be bound by formalities.
Relax and think of me as your own mother.
I will honor both you and the Prince with all my heart.
Your Majesty.
Prince Jumong is here.
Oh.
Tell him to come in.
Sit down.
How do you feel about the wedding?
I know Daeso's using it for political reasons... but it will make him trust me even more.
You've endured and waited.
I think it's time for you to rise.
You might have gained Daeso's trust but you mustn't let your guard down.
I won't.
After the wedding, take your wife to Mt.
Chunmu.
That's where Haemosu is.
I fed him to the eagles instead of burying him.
He said he'd rather fly with them and look over our lost land.
There won't be any trace of him but I'm sure his spirit is still there.
Welcome.
It's been a while.
Father.
How have you been?
Congratulations on this joyful day.
Welcome.
My heart goes out to you
Standing here by the river
My heart goes out to you
Standing here by the river
If only you'd look at me once more
If only you'd touch me once more
I feel my tears mixing with the rain
And wipe it away so no one sees
I feel my tears mixing with the rain
And wipe it away so no one sees
I can't get drunk, no matter how much I drink.
Same here.
We should be happy, celebrating his wedding.
Why do I feel so empty?
Did you see Lady Sosuhno?
Yeah.
- She looked...
- Hey!
Change the topic.
It's just too sad...
You asked for me?
The King says Haemosu is buried on Mt.
Chunmu.
I'd like to go there.
Lead the way.
What's wrong?
Your Highness.
Please kill me.
What?
Shortly after Haemosu's death, the Han severed all ties with us.
Prince Daeso went to Hyunto to relieve our salt shortage.
He came back to Puyo one night... and threatened me to tell him where Commander Haemosu was buried.
Why did he want to know that?
I wondered too, so I looked into it...
Tell me.
Prince Daeso... had given Haemosu's head to Yangjung... in return for the salt he brought back.
Your Highness.
I gave in to Prince Daeso and Naro.
I've done something terrible.
I deserve to die.
I fed him to the eagles instead of burying him.
He said he'd rather fly with them and look over our lost land.
There won't be any trace of him but I'm sure his spirit is still there.
Jumong.
When I was young...
I tried to fulfill a great mission.
But I failed to protect the love of my life.
You must not do the same.
How can you protect thousands if you can't even protect one?
I think your mother is a very wise and lovely lady.
Protect her, by all means.
Father.
You said you have some good news.
Tell us what it is.
It's good news for Puyo... but bad news for the Han Empire.
What is it?
Jinbun and Imdoon... will become part of Nakrang.
Is that true?
Yes.
It's all because of the war.
Jinbun and Imdoon... still don't have a governor.
They can't protect their own people.
The Emperor is holding me responsible.
I'm in an awkward situation.
I'm sorry.
There's only one way to get out of it.
I must send the Josun migrants who escaped during the war... to the Han Capital as slaves.
Track the migrants and send them to Hyunto... like you promised last time.
Send the migrants who have already settled down?
What will the people say?
You know the mess I'm in.
Something's got to give.
It's only fair.
My life is on the line here.
Have some tea.
Yangsullan.
Talk to him for me.
I need the people's support.
Your Highness.
Do as my father says.
You won't get another chance to win the Han Emperor over.
Gain the Emperor's trust... and your future will be much brighter.
I wonder if he'll do as I say.
Don't worry.
I told him he should win the Emperor's trust.
He seemed to agree.
You'll get your way.
How's Jumong these days?
I heard he's a changed man.
He is.
His Royal Highness seems to trust him.
But I don't.
Is there a reason?
Prince Daeso and Jumong are not related.
What do you mean?
Prince Jumong isn't King Kumwa's son.
What?
Then who is his real father?
His real father... is Haemosu.
Your Highness, this is Naro.
Come in.
Prince Daeso is looking for you.
You asked for me?
Welcome.
Did you have sweet dreams?
I must've been nervous.
I fell into a deep sleep.
I see.
Jumong.
Yes?
Yangjung wants to track down... the migrants who fled the Han Empire... and send them back as slaves.
I refused but... it's the Emperor's order and I can't just ignore it.
Nakrang will merge with Jinbun and Imdoon.
We have to send the migrants to appease the Emperor.
If not, we might have to go to war again.
I need your help.
We have to track them down and send them back.
You do it.
Is there no other way but to send the migrants back?
Tell me if you have a better idea.
We went to war to save the migrants.
If we send them back, our men will have died for nothing.
The migrants have settled down.
It won't be easy to track them down.
The people will complain if we try too hard.
I've thought about it long and hard but there's no other choice.
If we refuse their request... our hard-earned peace will be disrupted.
I support your decision.
Prince Jumong will be in charge of sending the migrants back.
I want you all to help him.
We will, Your Royal Highness.
That fool.
He really is giving them all we have.
Your Majesty.
Is there nothing we can do?
If we comply with their demand we'll have gone to war for nothing.
I'm sorry to say that...
Prince Daeso left Prince Jumong in charge.
What did Jumong say?
He said he would do it.
Your Majesty.
You asked for me?
Are you in charge of sending the migrants back?
Daeso told me to do so.
Are you really going to?
Mother.
If I say no, someone else will do it.
He'll send them away one way or another.
I'll take care of it.
Trust me and wait.
Are you really going to track down the migrants?
You should save them, not send them back.
Are you serious?
!
Say something.
Are you really going to do what Prince Daeso says?
No way.
I won't let you.
We thought you gave in to Prince Daeso because you had a plan.
If this is it, we refuse to serve you.
If so... then leave.
Your Highness...
Dang.
He's changed.
He's not the man he used to be.
I'd rather die fighting the Han jerks.
How...
How can we send them back as slaves?
!
Hey, guys, is it true?
Is Prince Jumong really in charge of sending the migrants back?
Yes.
Jeez...
What the...?
There must be a misunderstanding.
He wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't.
Mopalmo.
It's hard to believe but it's true.
He told us himself.
I think he's changed sides for good.
We've decided to leave.
- Something's not right.
- What do you mean?
He'd never do something like that.
I'm sure he has a good reason.
And I know what that reason is.
Look, isn't it obvious?
He's disgusted with Palace life, what with the fighting and all.
The King, his only backup, has been pushed aside... and even the love of his life has married another man.
What's there to live for?
He wants to take it easy now... doing as Prince Daeso says.
- Hey.
- You jerk!
- How dare you say that about him!
- Mopalmo, Mopalmo...!
- How dare you!
- Ow...
That fool.
What the heck was that about?
Mopalmo.
Your Highness.
We'll do as you wish... and leave you.
Thanks for everything.
Take care.
This is too much.
Is this it?
What are you crying about?
It's for the better.
It's over now.
It's all over!
We're going to... track down the migrants who have settled in Puyo.
Be swift and precise...
- To minimize the chaos and unrest.
- We will!
- Let's go.
- OK.
Get every single one of them!
Hurry up!
After him!
You think you could run?
- Oi!
- Oi!
Stop it.
Don't make a commotion.
Let's go.
Welcome.
Thank you for your efforts.
Thanks to Prince Jumong, we're making good progress.
How many have you caught?
We have about 200 so far.
Almost 1 ,000 escaped Jinbun and Imdoon.
But some live in the mountains and many have fled at the news.
We can't find them all.
How many do you think we can get?
About 500.
That should be enough.
I know it's hard work but speed it up a bit.
I'll reward you when you're done.
Thank you.
Long time no see.
Hi.
Our leaders have parted their ways.
I was afraid we'd have to do the same.
So was I.
What brings you all the way here?
What's the matter?
You see...
I left Puyo for good.
My Lady, this is Sayong.
Come in.
What is it?
Prince Jumong is sending the migrants to the Han Empire as slaves.
Are you sure?
I heard it from Hyupbo.
He left Puyo to come here.
He went to war to save the migrants.
He risked his life to do so.
But now he's sending them back.
Don't you think it's strange?
It's time Prince Jumong left Puyo.
What does that have to do with sending the migrants back?
Lady Sosuhno.
Yes?
Prince Jumong is Haemosu's son.
The Han Empire is an enemy state to them both.
There's no way he'll send the migrants as slaves.
I'm sure he has plans of his own.
He'll be here for good.
Take good care of him.
I heard you're pretty strong.
Yeah, they say so.
Then you should be our bodyguard.
Sure.
I'll do anything you want me to.
Get them!
Giddyup!
Get them!
Get them!
Giddyup!
Your Highness!
How can you do this?
!
How can you, of all people, send us back to the Han Empire?
!
Commander Haemosu... will turn in his grave!
Shut up!
- Take them away!
- Yes, sir.
Your Highness!
How is it coming along?
Jumong is taking care of it.
That's what I heard.
I wonder what made him change so suddenly.
He works for me now.
Don't worry.
Consider him one of my trusted servants.
I'm actually glad I didn't send him as a hostage.
The people don't like what's going on... but they're blaming Prince Jumong.
He's shielding Prince Daeso from it all.
Exactly.
He's forsaken the public to serve me.
Don't doubt him anymore.
Your Majesty, Prince Jumong is here.
Come in.
Sit down.
Do you have a plan?
Yes.
What is it?
I'm going to leave with the migrants.
Will that be possible?
Daeso trusts me.
It shouldn't be too hard.
Where will you take them?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll build a hideout where no one can get me... and rebuild the Damul Army.
I need you... to help me.
Very well.
You didn't track them down.
You gathered them instead.
Yes.
Daeso actually helped me do so.
You should get ready to leave too.
What's wrong?
I can't leave the King behind.
Not when he's lost everything.
Mother.
If I leave you, Daeso won't let you be.
I can't leave without you.
Yesoya.
I will... leave Puyo soon.
I'll leave with the migrants and never come back.
Did you tell the King and Lady Yuhwa?
I did.
We'll be leaving soon.
Get ready.
Make your bets.
- Odd.
- Wait.
- Even.
- Even?
Odd!
It's odd!
Sorry, guys.
Huh?
How dare you trick us!
You jerks!
You're dead meat!
Stop!
Get lost.
We need to talk.
We don't want to listen.
Let's go.
Oi, Mari.
I need your help.
Are you really going to leave Puyo with them?
I know you were disappointed but I couldn't make you do such a thing.
Your Highness.
Now you know.
Please help me.
I can't make it without you.
We were so narrow-minded, we didn't even trust you.
Forgive us.
Where's Hyupbo?
He went to Keru.
We don't have much time.
Send someone for him.
OK.
Are you ready to leave?
I'm trying to gather as many migrants as I can.
I'll ask Daeso to let me take them... then change course... as soon as I leave Puyo.
Will Daeso let you take them?
I obeyed his every word so far.
He trusts me now.
He'll let me go.
Your Majesty.
There's something we have to discuss.
Your mother?
Forgive me.
She'll never be able to ask for your permission.
Forgive me for asking for such a favor.
Leave with your mother.
You asked for me?
Have a seat.
You haven't fully recovered yet.
You shouldn't drink too much.
A few drinks can't do much harm.
Yuhwa.
Yes?
We've known each other for decades.
You went through so much.
You lost your father and tribe in one day.
And you had to let Haemosu go... after seeing him just once after 20 years.
You struggled to protect Jumong from the Queen and her sons.
I can only imagine what it was like.
Your Majesty.
Why bring it all up now?
After all you've been through, you deserve to live in peace.
But I've done nothing for you.
I'm nothing but a burden.
Your Majesty.
I couldn't protect Haemosu... and I couldn't protect you or Jumong.
Forgive me.
Leave Puyo with Jumong.
Your Majesty.
You'll be in danger here.
Your Majesty.
Where else can I go?
I'll stay.
I'd rather die with you.
Yuhwa.
If you don't go, Jumong can't either.
Jumong has Yesoya, his friends and the migrants.
You have no one but me.
Yuhwa.
See, wasn't I right?
I said he'd have a reason.
Jeez, I completely fell for it.
Couldn't he have told us at least?
Aren't we his team?
Try to understand.
He couldn't risk it.
Sure.
Hey...
Is Mooduk going too?
Of course she is.
She's Lady Yuhwa's maid, isn't she?
She's all he cares about now.
Hey, do you know where he'll go?
We don't know that yet.
Why worry?
I bet he has everything planned.
Of course.
He wouldn't leave without a plan.
We'll have to start packing soon.
Fear not.
I'll be sure to take all my secrets with me.
Well...
I'd love to stay... but something must be up or Oi and Mari wouldn't call me.
Take care.
I will.
Sayong.
I'll come right back if it's not important, so take care.
Go back inside.
Giddyup.
Gather the troop leaders.
What's the matter?
Songyang wants us to prepare the tributes for Puyo.
What does he want?
200 horses, 500 rolls of silk, some rubies and tiger fur.
Those jerks!
Are they out to ruin us?
We can't afford all that.
Songyang should know that.
I wonder why he's being so unreasonable.
It's just an excuse.
He knows we can't afford it.
He'll use it against us to demand something else.
Tell Songyang we can't do it.
Confronting him now won't do any good.
We should pretend to comply and see what he's up to.
Songyang is trying to make us his subjects.
He can't do that just because we couldn't arrange the tributes.
Songyang is out to get you.
Yuncheryung should be on her way back.
I'm going to make Sosuhno resign.
Yuncheryung's son Chansoo should be the next chief.
I will do as you say, my Lord.
Naro.
Yes?
That'll do.
Stop tracking them down.
OK.
I heard you're hard at work.
I'm only obeying Prince Daeso.
My father will be very pleased too.
You started a war to save them, but now you're tracking them down.
I wonder what made you change your mind.
I'm only doing my job.
Hauchun.
Yes?
Something's not right about him.
Keep him under close watch.
I will.
- Your Royal Highness.
- Welcome.
We've captured all the migrants we could find.
Good job.
We should get ready to send them to Hyunto then.
Your Highness.
What is it?
I want to finish this myself.
Please let me take them to Hyunto.
You should be tired after all the work.
Naro will go.
You can take a break.
No.
Let me do this.
I want to finish what I've started.
If that's what you want, then do it.
Thank you.
Before I met her, I thought of the Moebius strip.
It's an interesting strip.
It has two sides, yet it ends in a single strip.
This story I'm about to hear Is it true?
Or is it a lie?
It's the story of a curse that recurs every 4 years on February 29th.

February 29
hello.
How do I get to Moonkyung mental hospital?
hold on, sir.
Here's your change.
Moonkyung mental hospital?
Go straight.
Take a left under the bridge.
You'll see it to your right about 10 minutes in.
Have a nice day.
Did I scare you?
Haven't you ever been in a mental institution before?
You scared me!
journalists can have heart attacks too, you know.
I haven't seen you in so long I had to make it special.
We haven't been in contact for a while.
What brings me here?
I wanted to help you out by giving you a story.
Why?
You don't want it?
I run a science column.
I only report on facts.
Have you ever met a stalker?
I've seen and met things you wouldn't believe.
What about ghosts?
Ever seen one?
No, but I'm sure they're easy to make up.
They clone dogs nowadays.
It's a scary world.
What if I told you a body came back from the dead?
What are you trying to say?
would you believe me?
If the person is still alive, then he probably didn't die.
You're talking like a true science columnist.
Did you know that John Lennon was murdered by a stalker?
will you just get to the point?
You'll see.
Jiyeon?
How do you feel today?
It's beautiful day, why don't you go outside?
Isn't it too bright in here?
I can't even open my eyes.
She doesn't like to be in the dark.
In fact, she thinks this is too dark.
How does she get her sleep?
She's an insomniac.
She hasn't slept in months.
I brought you a journalist, you can talk to.
He believes your story.
will you talk to him?
Nice to meet you.
I Ieft in a hurry, so I forgot to bring my note.
If there's anything I can help, I'll do it.
will you tell me your story?
This is an unauthorized visit, so we don't have much time.
My superiors can't find out about this.
It's getting dark.
Pardon?
She comes to see me when it's dark.
Who comes to see you?
The murderer who died 12 years ago.
No one believes me,
But that woman is still alive.
She even appears in my nightmares.
She's coming to kill me.
Why would she kill you?
I saw her face.
Her cursed face!
What's the date today?
February 29th.
please, Get me out of here.
If I stay here, she'll come to kill me!
please!
Let me out!
It's too cold for this.
This is too dark.
Make up your mind!
This is pretty.
Hey!
How's it going?
Are you ready to leave the country?
Hey there!
Are you in Pusan right now?
What are you talking about?
I'm on my way to work.
Don't lie to me I just saw you pass by!
You need to buy me a drink before I leave the country.
But I'm not in Pusan.
I'm going to work.
Aren't you wearing jeans and a lime green sweater?
Do you have a secret boyfriend or something?
It must be just a coincidence.
It's probably someone who looks like me.
Really?
I could swear it was you.
Why would I lie to you?
call me before you leave, I'll go to the airport.
Okay, see you later!
Look at you!
You're so fresh and pretty.
I wish I were fresh, I'm stuck at work all the time.
Why don't we go on a trip?
I heard we don't have to pay the full amount at once.
really?
We could go for some fresh air, and we can lose some of these extra pounds!
That's the hope I've been singing this tune for months.
would you say I've got a common face?
Did someone tell you that you look like a clown?
You'd never understand.
Not with a face like yours.
We're about the same.
What should we do to kill time today?
Just don't be late for your shift.
Yes, ma'am.
Good evening.
Thank you.
Over here sir.
Thank you.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Thank you.
Is that Jongsook?
What is she doing here?
Jongsook?
It's not time yet!
Go back to the lounge.
Why can't she hear me?
Are we having a power out?
This can't be...
What does the rulebook say about a situation like this?
This is awful.
I'm terribly sorry.
We're having a blackout.
The machines are not working.
Let me get you your change.
It's already time for shifts!
Time for me to get to work.
I want to stay in that warm lounge longer.
You scared me.
- Jongsook?
- Yeah?
Did you see that car?
What car?
I didn't see anything.
I guess you couldn't see it because of the blackout.
Just before, some woman...
What blackout?
Didn't you see the lights go off?
No.
Everything was fine at the lounge.
Hurry up.
Before I don't rotate with you.
Why did the power go out, Mr. Kim?
The power didn't go out.
I was watching soccer on TV.
What's the date tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
It's March 1st.
I knew it.
This is why I feel bad for people born on February 29th.
Why?
February 29th only comes every four years, and sadly, it's my birthday.
That's pretty sad.
Do you want a birthday gift?
It has to be very special.
I only get one birthday in 4 years!
In fact, why don't we take a day off tomorrow?
I don't know.
It'll be really awesome!
I promise it'll be great!
AII right then.
Drink this if you get sleepy.
Jongsook?
Have you ever received a ticket with blood on it?
Of course!
One time,
I even got a ticket with poo all over it.
Anything can happen here.
See you!
This is our news update.
A tollgate employee was found stabbed to death last night at Dongseong Tollgates around ten-forty.
The violence of this crime suggests careful execution and planning.
In other news, a fire broke out last night at a schooling institution.
Was Dongseong ToIIgate near your work place?
Yes.
It's only 10 minutes away.
The bloodstained ticket must have had something to do with it.
When Jongsook told me about her birthday,
I suddenly remembered that woman.
Is February 29th a significant date?
There's a curse on our toIIgate.
Every four years, people die for no reason on February 29th.
Why?
A few years ago, an accident occurred on February 29th.
A prison bus exploded near our toIIgate.
AII the criminals managed to escape, except for one person.
Is she the woman you mentioned earlier?
But they didn't find her body.
It wasn't on the bus.
Her body was not quite burned...
It was gone.
Did you witness the accident?
No.
I heard it from some people at work.
That woman's spirit lived on.
Every 4 years, she kills someone.
From that day on, I began to see her everywhere.
I knew I shouldn't have bought this on the internet.
Everyone ends up having the same stuff!
What is the matter with her?
Apartment security.
Sir?
This is Apartment 808.
Some woman's been knocking on my neighbor's door for an hour.
That's strange I didn't get any calls.
will you please do something?
I can't fall asleep.
I'll check for you.
Han Jiyeon?
This is the police.
I need to ask you about the murder at the tollgates.
Have you heard about it?
Yes.
We need to ask you a few questions.
Do you remember this?
I heard it was you who received this ticket.
Yes.
It was me.
Do you remember the face of that customer?
No.
There was a blackout, so I couldn't see anything.
I didn't know toIIgates had blackouts.
What about the car?
Did you see what kind?
No.
I just know it was black.
And you didn't get the license plate number?
No.
I was too shocked when I saw the blood.
Why didn't you call the police?
Because.
These things happen often at tollgates.
That ticket was issued from Dongseong ToIIgates.
The time punched in the ticket matches the time of the murder.
The lab is running the blood through tests.
If it matches the blood of the victim, we'll have a suspect.
Are you working late tonight?
Huh?
Yes.
It's not an easy job.
You should get some rest.
We'll come back if we have anymore questions.
Good day.
You should be careful.
These cases usually turn out to be serial murders.
And the killer is usually among the people we first interview.
Thank you.
I'm not saying that you're a suspect.
That's just what they teach us at the police academy.
Good day.
First, she presses the call button to page one of the employees.
An employee runs out to help the customer.
The murderer then stabs the victim with a sharp knife.
blood spatters everywhere.
The ground gets covered in blood.
The murderer leaves quietly,
leaving the victim behind.
The victim dies in a slow and painful way.
Anna?
Hey!
Come to the first floor of the building.
What are you talking about?
I just saw you walking by.
You're in a white jacket with a butterfly pin.
No, You're mistaken.
Why are you trying to hide from me?
Let's have lunch with my boyfriend.
It's not me!
What's the matter?
Are you okay?
You saw someone else That wasn't me you saw.
You look awful!
I barely got any sleep.
Did you hear about the person who died at Dongseong?
It gave me the cold creeps.
Why does it have to be a tollgate employee?
I'm too scared to go to work.
Are you sure there was no blackout last night?
What if you were sleeping and you didn't know?
could be.
I remember it got dark for a few minutes.
Oh!
Oh...
I guess it's already been 4 years.
Why?
Who is that?
Remember that murderer who died in that burning bus?
That's her grandmother.
She's got AIzheimer's, so she keeps looking for her.
Does she come here every 4 years?
Isn't it ironic?
The day I was born was the day she died.
Mr Kim!
Jiyeon and I want to take a day off tomorrow.
Ma'am?
You can't stay there.
Ma'am?
It's too dangerous!
Hey, excuse me...
Show your ticket...
Why are you so jumpy?
Who left this here?
I'm scared enough as it is.
- Jongsook?
- Yeah?
About that curse...
What curse?
The February 29th curse?
What if that woman is still alive?
There was that murder at the Dongseong ToIIgate.
What if we're next?
Did you see her ghost?
really?
Last night, she came...
You're kidding.
Right?
That's just a stupid ghost story.
You should take some pills to help you sleep.
Jiyeon?
It's Inspector Park.
There's been another murder at the Neunggok ToIIgate.
The victim was murdered in the same manner.
Did you happen to see that car last night?
I don't remember I was too tired last night.
You didn't get anymore tickets with blood on them?
No.
The murderer had to have used one of the exit toIIgates.
But we can't look into all the tollgates in the country.
The blood on the ticket was not from the victim.
Then what was that car about?
Whose blood was it on the ticket?
There's something else.
What is it?
The computer had no record of a blackout.
Jiyeon?
What's going on?
I swear I'm not lying.
There was a blackout.
Look!
Computers don't lie.
Think carefully.
Are you sure you didn't fall asleep?
would you believe me if I said there was a blackout last night?
That car was also there last night.
Do you know you can go to jail for false testimonies?
I can't seem to see the face of that person.
I don't recall anything except the smell of something burning.
That's impossible.
Why haven't you seen his face yet?
I know one thing for sure...
There are deep scratches on the woman's wrist.
But you haven't seen her face.
How would you know it's a woman?
I have an idea who it is.
Who is she?
It's the serial killer who died several years ago.
That woman is still alive.
What?
She's been appearing everywhere in the same clothes I'm wearing.
She's acting just like me!
She's been killing people every February 29th!
Don't you see?
What's the date today?
February 29th.
Send this to the lab.
But sir.
And find out all you can about that serial killer.
It looks like schizophrenic symptoms.
A bad memory from dark is influencing her to sleep.
It could be a form of insomniac that usually happen to overly anxious people.
First, you should take some sleeping pills to help you fall asleep and later get further psychological treatments.
The bus which was going to jail was overturned on a snowy road.
A condemned woman was burned and died.
She had couple of suture surgery.
Jiyeon!
It took a while for me to find this information.
plus, I got stuck in traffic.
Do you recognize her?
Yes!
It's her!
It's the woman who was strangling me.
Are you sure?
It's her.
She came back from the dead to kill more people?
Who's supposed to believe that?
She didn't come back from the dead.
She never died.
The police report says she was burned to death in the fire.
No, I know she's alive.
We're not here to investigate the past.
We're investigating into a murder that's happening now!
You saw her strangIing me!
Don't you care about my safety?
Fine!
Let's say she's back.
Why would she kill the people working at tollgates?
serial killers don't need reasons.
They just kill.
AII right.
Find out more about this woman.
talk to the inspectors who handled the case.
Yes, sir.
Who's at the tollgate today?
Inspector Kim.
AII right.
Let's stop by to see him.
I need to check something out.
Jiyeon?
Are you going to work today?
No, It's my friend's birthday, so I took a day off.
That's a rare birthday to have.
She only gets to celebrate it once every 4 years.
Where's that ticket?
You said you saw it on the wall.
I don't know.
It's gone.
Yes.
Are you taking medication?
They're sleeping pills, I haven't slept in 3 days.
It's no wonder, since you see dead people.
Excuse me.
May I ask you for a favor?
will you please walk me to the parking lot?
I didn't know you went to church.
Chew on one of these if you get sleepy.
Maybe you should go see a doctor.
I'm a professional, I've done this for 10 years.
Whatever.
Jiyeon!
Jongsook?
Where should we meet?
I'm really sorry.
I forgot to tell you.
Why?
Did you make other plans?
Mrs. Lee couldn't come in to work today.
So I agreed to cover for her.
Since you have been exhausted lately.
You can't stay there.
Get out of there.
Why?
Is something wrong?
You sound upset.
Today is February 29th!
Don't you know that?
Are you still obsessed about that stupid rumor?
I'm late for my shift!
I have to go.
Jongsook!
Jongsook!
Are you crazy?
Get off the damn road!
She's been wearing the same clothes as mine.
She's killed so many people.
I'm scared of that curse.
It's my fault Jongsook died.
I couId have saved her if I was there on time.
If only those inspectors had believed me.
Why don't we take a break?
We'll continue later.
Come on.
You don't believe me either.
Pardon me?
I can tell from your face.
How can you tell?
Your face make me sick.
It's been 4 years since Jongsook died.
If she were alive, today would be her birthday.
That's right.
Today's the 29th.
If I die, will you believe me?
will you?
Get me out of here now!
The blood is from the murderer.
We'll have to check the other ticket.
But the blood on the tickets match.
Don't you believe me?
Truth is a relative thing.
Everyone has his own side of the same story.
If you had believed me, Jongsook would still be alive!
Of course the detective, too...
The DNA tests will tell us who the murderer is.
Can I go now?
I'm sorry.
You must still be in shock.
February 29th is over.
will the ghost return in 4 years?
will she?
You need to get some sleep.
You need to get some sleep.
How can you sleep with all those lights on?
I've been having some bad days.
That all depends on how you see it.
If you think bad thoughts, bad things will happen to you.
By the way, are you sure you heard those knocking sounds?
What?
Nobody else in the building heard that, except for you.
Jiyeon?
Are you okay?
We saw your lights flashing.
Are you okay?
Yes, I must be too tired.
Is there somebody else in there?
No, I Iive alone.
We got orders from the top.
We'll be with you 24 hours.
Is something going to happen to me?
Don't you remember how she strangled you?
You must be getting no sleep at all.
Are you working late again?
Yes.
It's too bad we can't close down all the tollgates.
call us before you leave.
We'll come and pick you up.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
You seem nervous.
I'm fine.
Let's go, sir.
Yeah.
We'll see you later.
Inspector Park?
Here.
What's this?
It's the car's license plate number.
Where did you see the car?
Did you see that woman?
Yes, She's been following me since this morning
She followed me to the parking lot...
She's probably watching me right now!
That car's been reported stolen.
I suspected as much.
Yeah?
Issue a search for that car.
Yes, sir.
It's me.
Can you issue out a search for this car?
Take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm almost ready.
Hey, help me!
Jiyeon?
I'm sorry!
I meant to turn on the bathroom lights.
I flipped off the wrong switch.
I feel like she's watching us.
Jiyeon?
Can you hear me?
Yes.
is it always this quiet at night?
It's always dead silent.
Something seems very wrong.
There are many strange things about this case.
Like what?
I've been to a few crime scenes myself.
But I never got this kind of feeling before.
This killer doesn't seem to have any feelings for her victims.
There's no sign of resistance from the crime scenes.
They knew they were against a person with no soul.
So what's your point?
It's possible the victims knew the murderer.
I guess we'll find out.
It could be that woman who died 12 years ago.
It could be her ghost...
Or it could be someone else.
Inspector Park?
She's here.
Inspector Park?
Are you there?
Inspector Choi!
Wake up!
Sir.
I saw the car.
I'm on it.
Be careful.
Don't do anything rash.
I won't.
What's going on?
Is that woman really back from the dead?
I guess not all ghost stories are false.
I should give up guns and start praying for God.
Is that the car you saw?
I'm near the car.
I think in the car, there is nothing.
Just a moment, I have a question for you.
The dooris, This is the police!
Inspector Choi!
Can you hear me?
Hey!
Do not leave your booth, do you hear me?
Lock the door!
Inspector Park?
- Please.
- Inspector Park?
are you okay?
Inspector Park?
Don't come in here.
Don't come in here.
Don't come in here!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
please!
please don't take me as a lunatic.
Go to the tollgate and see!
I was telling the truth.
If I stay here, she'll come to kill me.
please.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm not insane!
I'll look in to it.
I can't make any promises, but I'll do my best.
Thank you for your story.
Open the door.
Jiyeon!
- You're all the same!
- Catch!
You're like the rest of them!
I didn't do anything wrong!
I'm not crazy!
Let go of me!
You listen to me!
Four years from now, I'm going to kill you!
Mark my words!
I'm going to come for you!
Let go!
What do you think?
Do you think she was telling the truth?
I don't know.
I don't know what to think.
Everyone here is considered insane.
I don't know what to believe.
Is she crazy,
Or did she really see a ghost?
will this make a good article?
It'll be interesting to track down a dead body.
Want to hear something interesting?
This is called the two faces of truth.
The two faces of truth?
Yeah.
As far as I know, that woman has not been lying at all.
She's only telling the truth.
So everything she said is true?
She told us the truth, but her story is not what actually happened.
She told us what she believes to be true.
But truth is a relative thing.
I remember that day exacteIy.
When I saw her first time, how can I say...
I feel sympathy.
Many memories are in patients' tears.
You heard the story about the dead body.
About the story of the ghost who came back from the dead.
But the police report tells a different story.
Jiyeon knew the face of the murderer from the beginning.
The police had listed Jiyeon as a suspect all along.
Han Jiyeon?
This is the police.
They discovered traces of someone else's blood mixed with the blood of the victim.
The blood on the ticket was not from the victim.
The police tailed her to the scene of the third murder.
But they lost her.
If they had caught her then, they would still be alive..
I talked to the car owner.
He's got a solid alibi.
And his record's clean.
That car's been reported stolen.
I suspected as much.
Yeah?
Issue a search for that car.
Yes, sir.
It's me.
Can you issue out a search for this car?
Who do you think is telling the actual truth?
What about the body that was lost in the bus fire?
That incident actually happened.
But the body was never found.
But Jiyeon's just a woman How did she manage to do this?
According to the record,
It's possible if she drove 100 miles an hour.
What if the police is blaming her, so they won't feel the heat?
Are you starting to get confused?
people fabricate stories all the time.
Who's to say the police are any better?
Our tests showed that she suffers from a mental illness.
Her lawyer is pleading insanity.
What's the reason for her mental illness?
The reason?
It stems from her fear of dark.
There was a blackout that night, but only inside her booth.
This confused the police at first.
We made startling discoveries about her past.
When she was 5 years old,
- She got trapped inside a sewer.
- help me!
She was rescued after three whole days.
This fear came back to haunt her when she experienced the blackout.
Remember.
Truth is a subjective thing.
Now it's up to you to make a story out of this.
The truth seems all fiction, I don't know what to believe.
If this works out, don't forget to buy me a drink.
Why did you lie to her earlier?
Today's not February 29th.
I feel bad about that, but it was the only way to make her talk.
Remember what she said?
There's a curse on that day, every four years.
By the way,
You'll have to be careful on the next February 29th.
Why?
Don't you remember?
Do you hear me?
Four years from now, I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!
Oh my God!
You whore!
Who are you dreaming about?
To let the food for the pigs burn like that?
You should be stomped by elephants and shredded by horses!
You stubborn, shameful, silly nitwit!
You disobedient fool!
You never listen do you!
For heaven's sake!
Smell it, smell the pot!
Madame, please forgive me!
Mrs. Hien Can't you smell the pot?
How dare you argue with me!
Forgive you?
And what about my pig pot?
Madame, I wasn't daydreaming!
How dare you carry on like this!
Servant!
I own you!
You dare argue with me?
You ingrate!
I will beat you to death!
From now on, I forbid you to see anyone!
You hear me?
Yes, Madame.
Do you remember what you,re supposed to do this afternoon?
Yes, I do.
I must catch crabs and snails to make soup for you tonight.
Then why are you still sitting here?
Go now!
Once darkness comes, the field will be submerged.
Come back empty-handed, you'll be dead with me!
I'll beat the living daylight out of you!
You scared me.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Come and rest for awhile.
I'll give you a hand later.
Run away with me.
Run away?
Where to?
I'm not sure.
As poor as I am, what else can I be but someone's servant?
Even if I have to beg, to work like a buffalo or a dog to take care of you, I'll be happy too.
I hope to get you out of here.
So she can't abuse you anymore.
I promise to get you out of here.
What are you doing here?
Lately, the Viet Minh have been uprising everywhere making me crazy.
Are you aware of that, Mr. Governor?
Yes, I've heard.
Have no fear, Captain.
In my village, rest at ease.
Relax and drink until you're drunk.
No Viet Minh dare act up here.
If someone just breathes like a Viet Minh
I'll have my soldiers strangle him, chain him and send him to the frontline to be a human shield for the French soldiers.
See that.
Please drink Captain.
Don't waste your time worrying about kids trying to make a revolution with bamboo sticks.
Hunchback, where are you going?
What are you doing with Mr. Governor's rice?
Please spare me.
Please don't tell Mr. Governor.
Mrs. Mui and her children have had nothing to eat for days.
I'm stealing some rice for them to eat.
Please have a heart, don't tell Mr. Governor.
Well, you better hurry.
If Mr. Governor finds out, you'll be in big trouble.
Yes.
Hunchback, where are you?
Come here this instant!
Mr. Governor is calling me!
Here.
Let me help you with that.
Yes.
Hunchback.
Yes, Madame.
If Mr. Governor asks for me, tell him
I'm going to see Mrs. Hoi.
Understood?
Yes, Madame.
Darling, what took you so long?
I've been waiting for hours.
I had to wait for Madame to leave before I could come over.
Look here.
This white silk dress is somehow linked closely to my life.
I don't know where it came from.
I only know as an infant
I was wrapped in it and left under the banyan tree.
I don't know where my ancestors came from or who my parents are.
For as long as I can remember, I've been a buffalo boy and then a servant for Mr. Governor.
But I've kept this white silk dress for the past twenty years.
It's the most precious thing I own.
If you truly love me, then please accept this as my wedding gift to you.
Please put the dress on, pray to Buddha and consider us engaged.
What do you pray to Buddha for?
What do you wish for?
I wish for only one thing, but I may never get it.
That is to marry you.
We love each other.
And I am already yours.
Why does it matter if we,re married?
Happiness is marrying the one you love.
It's better than having herds of cows and buffaloes.
Darling, I don't need a big tray of betel nuts covered with red silk.
But if you still want to marry me, then take this betel nut home and plant it.
When it bears fruits, we'll have our wedding.
What if... it doesn't bear fruits?
If you truly love me, then it surely will.
Please play a tune for me.
If you are not a Viet Minh, then why did you steal my rice?
Only a Viet Minh would dare do that.
How many times have you stolen from me before?
You stole my rice to feed the Viet Minh to rebel against me, didn't you?
Speak up!
Please Sir and Madame I'm innocent... a thousand kowtows to you.
I'm not a Viet Minh.
You are heaven's light, seeing far and wide.
Sir and Madame it was not him.
It was me who committed the crime.
I stole the rice, but I'm not a Viet Minh.
Stealing rice means that you are Viet Minh.
Understand, you son of a bitch!
So, it was you?
How dare you bite the hand that feeds you?
I've been so blind.
For God's sake, you listened to the Viet Minh.
You stole our rice!
You bastard!
Damn you!
Who did you steal for?
Are you mute?
Your crime warrants death.
Guard, tie him up.
Give him a hundred lashes, immediately!
Whip him!
Let's get those French puppets.
If we don't seize our national liberation now, if we don't gain our independence, then we'll be enslaved forever and never be free.
Let's get the Governor!
Let's get the Governor!
Sir!
The Viet Minh are attacking!
Open the door!
Guards!
What's all the noise about?
Let's get the Governor!
What's going on?
Guards...
Down with the Governor!
You've taken our rice fields, left us starving and miserable.
You've betrayed the people and ruined the country for your French masters!
Get them out of here!
Let's burn them alive!
I beg you, misters and madames.
Burn them alive!
My husband...
How did this happen?
Burn them alive!
Who killed you?
Damn you, take it easy.
Are you trying to break my toes?
Mother, Dan has learned to tell lies lately.
I saw her with Hunchback the other day coming out of the abandoned house.
But when I confronted her, she denied everything.
One of these days she will come home with a big belly and give birth to a little hunchback.
If you're not careful, she may blame it on Father.
ls that right?
She's a slut.
Girls like her are going to elope sooner or later.
Such a pity.
Your father and I wasted our time raising her.
If I ever see you with that hunchback servant again then damn your ancestors.
I swear I'll beat you to death.
You shameless whore.
Oh my God!
You monster.
Are you trying to kill me?
It's me.
Run away with me.
Did she beat you again?
They can't do anything to me.
Why are you here?
What's with you?
Run away with me.
Mr. Governor and Madame have been killed.
Their house burnt to the ground.
Come with me.
Dan, you've died out there haven't you?
I hope lightning strikes you, so I don't ever have to look at your face again.
You'd better go.
Come with me now.
Sooner or later the Viet Minh will be here.
Run away with me.
We'll escape to the South.
Go wherever we can be safe.
Let's just close our eyes and step forward.
We'll go together.
Whatever happens happens.
There's nothing to worry about as long as we,re together.
Here are the Viet Minh, who wanted their independence and freedom.
This is how they got it.
Let's go.
The defeat at Dien Bien Phu on May / 7th / 1954 marks the end of France's 100 years Indochina empire.
The Gevene Treaty was signed on July / 20th /1954.
Vietnam was divided into communist North Vietnam and
American-backed South Vietnam.
What is it, darling?
Your white silk dress.
Are you going to rake mussels?
Yes.
Darling, one of us has to keep an eye on the baby.
Don't worry, she's not going anywhere.
Darling, our daughter is almost a month old, but we still haven't given her a name.
Let's name her Flood.
Since we,re poor, we'll give her an ugly name.
So she won't suffer from poverty later.
Our ancestors have always taught us so.
Mussels, mussels for sale.
Mussels for sale.
Mussels for sale.
Go with Mom.
Be quick!
Mussels for sale.
Mussels for sale.
Come on.
Push!
Push harder!
Harder!
It's not your firstborn.
Why is it so difficult?
Push harder!
Harder!
Push harder!
Push harder!
Push harder!
Harder!
You were born the year of the Snake, thirty-seven-years-old.
You have the fate of an orphan.
Since you were born, you have had a hard and pitiful life.
This year will be a very bad year.
There's a bad star rising for you.
Your dreams will go unfulfilled.
Disrupted so bad, very bad.
Bad times are coming.
So bad...
But you can change your fate.
If you are not married, then you must get married.
And if...
Right, you're right.
I must get married.
As a matter of fact, I have a wife, but we,re not married yet.
Could we be considered husband and wife?
No.
You will only be considered husband and wife after a proper wedding.
Please advise me on a good day for us to be married.
It will be good when the element of fire meets the year of metal.
According to the movement of the five elements in the universe this year, the year of the horse, the nineteenth of November on the lunar calendar will be a good day for marriage.
If you get married this day, you will be together forever.
What is it, darling?
Darling, we have to name our baby.
Just look at her, look how cute she is.
We can't keep calling her "Whatever" forever.
They,re all girls.
There are no more names left to give them.
Besides, girls don't need names.
Calling her "Whatever" is fine.
Boy or girl, she is still our baby.
We still have to give her a name.
How can you say calling her "Whatever" is fine?
Dad, Mom, I'm going to school now.
Walk safely, okay?
Yes.
History.
Tay Son Dynasty 1778 - 1802.
Today we are going to study about the Tay Son brothers.
Who can tell me who they were?
I can, teacher.
An.
They were Nguyen Nhac, Nguyen Lu, and Nguyen Hue.
Right.
An, I told you several days ago that you have to wear a white dress before you can come to this class.
You have to wear a white dress like your classmates.
You and your sister Corn are now in sixth grade.
Corn.
Why are you crying?
We are not allowed to go to school if we don't wear white dresses.
What are we going to do now, Corn?
Once upon a time, under the Tran Dynasty, there was a poor couple who loved each other very much.
Daddy, do you know what this word means?
Do you know what this word means?
Attached.
Wrong.
Okay, now I am your teacher.
I'll teach you how to read, okay?
Can you read this word?
D...
D...
Dau.
Wrong.
Dan.
Dan is mom's name.
I can't believe you don't know how to spell it.
I'll teach you to read so when you grow up you will be able to read and write like me and An.
And someday you will be able to read the newspaper and write mom's name.
Yesterday, my teacher taught me a new word. "Peace".
ls "Peace" beautiful, Daddy?
I have never seen "Peace".
But I'm certain it is beautiful As beautiful as you are.
No!
I would like "Peace" to be as beautiful as Mom.
Enough, dear teacher.
Bring this basket of rice inside and prepare the table for dinner.
Okay .
It's rather hot.
Blow on it before you eat it.
Don't be hasty or you'll burn your mouth.
Corn, can you pour me a bowl?
Let me hold her.
Mom, why don't you cook rice anymore?
We've been eating porridge the last three days.
Just one more night.
We'll have rice tomorrow, my dear.
But you promised me that two days ago
I told you we'll have rice tomorrow.
Finish your meal!
If you don't want to eat just leave it!
Mom...
An and I don't want to go to school anymore.
Why not?
Mom, we,re in sixth grade now.
Teacher said we have to wear white dresses to attend school.
Everyone wears a white dress to school.
Let us stay home.
If you don't want us selling mussels, then we can help cook for you and Dad.
I've heard from the neighbors that a girl should not study too much.
If a girl is well educated, she may never find a husband.
Girls now should study as much as the legendary Trung Sisters or Lady Trieu did in the past.
Let me take care of the dresses.
If my girls are this untidy, then how do they expect to find husbands?
Now go back and finish your porridge.
We,re so poor,
I don't want to go to school anymore.
My two oldest daughters are in sixth grade, but we don't have enough money to buy white dresses for them to go to school.
I have no choice, but to come here and ask for your help.
Will you please take pity on me and be kind enough to lend me some money?
I will forever be in your debt.
The interest is ten percent per month.
You can borrow as much as you want, but you must give me something as collateral.
We are so poor, we only earn enough to live day by day.
We never have enough for a full meal.
We have nothing of value in the house.
No collateral, no loan.
Not even a penny.
I don't have any extra money to hand out.
My money is made through sweat and tears, not simply printed so you can borrow without collateral.
I can't hold what I can't grasp.
Understand?
Nobody can trust your twisted tongue.
If you need money, then go get a job.
Be a maid or whatever.
Accept your lot.
And stop trying to send your kids to school like an upper class family.
Shame on you for thinking that.
Did you just give birth?
Yes, Madame.
How many children do you have?
Four, Madame.
Aren't you too poor to have that many?
Heck, if my pigs gave birth as often as you,
I would not be this poor.
If a pig gives birth often, you make profit.
But having that many kids, you,re sure to starve.
Wait, Mr. Thoon in the other hamlet is looking for a wet nurse.
If you want to have money for your daughters to go to school, then go work for that family.
They need breast milk from a first time mother not from a mother of four like her.
The milk of a first time mother can earn big money.
But a mother of four like her, should get something.
Go to work for Mr. Thoon if you want to earn some money to feed your children.
But if you want to earn money for their schooling, then come live here and work for me.
Seeing you so desperate, I would like to help.
If Mrs. Thoon asks anything, then just tell her that Mrs. Tam from Saigon sent you.
Come inside and wait a moment.
Are you the wet nurse?
Yes, Madame.
Open your blouse and let me see.
This is for Mr. Thoon.
She already has four children.
Where is she?
Mrs. Dan.
Yes, Madame.
Follow me.
Take off your blouse.
Please give me the baby, I'll breast-feed him.
You,re not here to breast-feed a baby.
You,re here to breast-feed Mr. Thoon.
He's very old.
He must have breast milk to give him strength.
If you agree, then stand over there by the hole.
Otherwise, go home.
Mr. Thoon sucks on a breast just like a baby sucks on a breast.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little sweet potato mixed with mussels.
Mom should be home soon to breast-feed you, understand?
Stop crying or
your belly button will pop out like a frog's eye.
That won't be a pretty sight, will it?
Isn't it good?
A little more, just a bit more.
Come on.
Mom.
Yes, I know.
Mom will be home soon.
If you don't want to eat, then I will sing you a song, okay?
Stop crying.
Let me hold her.
She's been crying from early morning until now.
I fed her sweet potato, but she refuses to eat.
You go to school.
No.
I don't want to go to school.
Mom will be sad if you don't.
Daddy, look what I found?
Give it to me.
Don't ever let me see you playing with those things again.
Yes, Daddy.
It's a grenade.
It will explode, understand?
How much is it per yard?
Ninety-five dongs per yard.
It's Bangkok silk.
I just got it in yesterday.
And what about this?
That one?
It's quite cheap.
Only fifty dongs per yard.
I want to make a white dress for my oldest daughter to go to school.
How much will it cost to get a dress made?
You,re having a dress made for An?
Yes.
Let me see.
For fabric and labor, one hundred fifty dongs.
But for you, I'll only charge one hundred twenty dongs.
Thank you.
I'll be back in a few days.
Remember to stop by, okay?
Yes, good bye.
Oh my God, my baby has had a fever since yesterday.
Your forehead is burning up.
Let me cook you some porridge and get you some medicine, okay?
Open your mouth.
Here.
Be nice, okay.
Try to eat some of this.
Mommy will be back soon.
It's really tasty.
Where has Mommy gone for so long?
Excuse me, is this Mrs. Dan's house?
Yes, but she isn't home.
How can I help you?
Mrs. Phon hasn't seen Mrs. Dan come by to breast-feed for two days.
That's why Mrs. Phon asked me to stop by and look for her.
Can't Mrs. Phon breast-feed the baby herself instead of calling on my wife?
It's not to breast-feed the baby.
It's to breast-feed Mr. Thoon.
Viet Cong!
Viet Cong!
Viet Cong!
Viet Cong!
Viet Cong!
Viet Cong!
The porridge is done, Mom.
Hold your sister for me.
Have some herbs.
Have some herbs.
You're going to be feel better.
It will
make you feel better.
Flood is still sick.
I'm very worried.
Darling, Flood is still very sick.
She's sick now.
She'll be fine later.
If she dies, then we'll have another.
You can still reproduce.
What's there to worry about?
What's wrong with you?
Your daughter is sick and you,re talking like an idiot.
Shut up!
You ungracious bitch!
Don't you dare speak to your husband like one of those ignorant women.
I'll slap you until you can speak no more, you ungrateful wretch!
Better to be poor, but decent!
What have I done so terribly wrong for you to yell at me like this?
Shut up!
What have you done so terribly wrong?
You're so clever, aren't you?
Don't waste time putting on an act with me.
Mr. Thoon is dying for breast milk and you sit here with it dripping all over your blouse.
What a waste!
You'd better go.
And don't worry if our baby cries of hunger,
I'll breast-feed her myself.
You haven't worked for two weeks now.
Where are we to find money to make a dress and buy medicine for our children?
I haven't worked because of the flood.
It's not because I'm lazy!
Mom, breast-feed the baby.
Your mother's milk already feeds someone else.
Take her out of here!
Crying all day long.
I already told you, if we don't have money to buy a dress, then let them quit school.
I didn't tell you to breast-feed a dying, old man for money.
We'll eat porridge to survive.
Look at Rich, she cries of hunger all day long.
But instead of breast-feeding her how shameful!
Even if I had to become a whore to take care of my children, I,d do it.
I would not be ashamed.
As for you are you ashamed people will know that your wife breast-feeds an old man?
Or are you ashamed that I have earned money to take care of our children?
As for me I am only ashamed that we brought them
into this world and are not able to take care of them.
Instead of feeling guilty, you sit there with your big mouth lecturing me.
Just because you gave birth to them, you think you can say whatever you want and do whatever you want with this family!
Hello.
Mrs. Dan.
What are you doing here at this hour?
Luckily, you are still awake.
I was afraid...it's late.
I didn't want to bother you.
But I didn't know who else to turn to.
What happened?
Please, have a seat.
I took a risk to come here.
I know you are busy, but please help me re-cut my white silk dress.
It's for my daughters.
I'll be forever in your debt.
Let me see.
How do I look?
Am I beautiful?
Do I look like a bride?
You look beautiful.
As beautiful as a painting.
No different than a real bride.
Thank you so much.
I don't know how else to show my gratitude.
You don't have to thank me.
We,re fellow country people.
And we hardly get a chance to talk.
Look, they've already started the curfew outside.
Why don't you stay here and go home early tomorrow morning?
You,re very kind, but my husband and kids are waiting for me at home.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Who's there?
Stop right there!
Where are you going at this hour?
Didn't you hear the curfew siren?
Where do you think you,re going?
I went to get a dress tailored at Kim Hong's tailor shop.
I heard the siren, but I have a baby at home.
So I took a chance going home at this time.
Please take pity on me.
What's that?
You went to the tailor shop this late?
Yes, sir.
Take her to the police station and question her.
Please take pity on me,
I have a small baby at home.
What's this?
"Everybody.
Let's stick together.
We've got to stand up and willingly die"
to fight against the American empire and its henchmen in order to gain our independence and reunify our country.
On behalf of HCM, a national front for South Viet Nam's liberation.
What's this?
Honestly, I don't know, Sir.
Liar!
If you,re not Viet Cong, then what is this?
A prescription for your mother?
Sir, I...
Liar!
One more time, tell me what this is?
Hey you!
Take this home.
Take this home.
Dan...
Dan...
What happened to you?
Who did this to you?
An wears that white silk dress as beautifully as you did.
Her eyes sparkling.
I know I didn't promise you anything good when I took you to the South.
What I wanted was to escape the poverty we came from.
But I feel so ashamed.
My failure as a husband makes me useless as a father.
Only a white dress for my daughters to go to school and I couldn't even provide it.
So you sacrificed your wedding dress.
Instead of loving you more, I scolded you and beat you.
What a bastard I am!
I'm not angry with you.
If I were a man whose wife has been breast-feeding an old man,
I would have slapped her, too.
The important thing is that you understand why I did what I did.
It was all for our children.
What I said and did to you makes me feel less than an animal.
How can you love such a man like me?
That day when you stole rice from Mr. Governor to help Mrs. Mui and you were nearly beaten to death,
I swore I would live my whole life to serve you.
I love you because you don't live for yourself.
You have sacrificed your whole life for me and the children.
I am tired of being poor.
If you were rich,
I wouldn't have followed you here.
I wouldn't have been your wife.
We,re poor, but we have happiness.
We have each other.
We have our children.
And we have this betel tree as well.
Sometimes I feel so guilty for being poor.
Especially now, when I've seen how you've suffered trying your best to get the dress made for our daughters.
It makes me more miserable than hearing bombs explode overhead.
The Governor once told me
"If a husband can't share in his wife's woes or help her, then he is smaller than an ant."
In wartime, one might die several times yet only live once.
We have lived a hard life, but my heart goes out to our daughters.
That's why each day that I am still on this Earth
I will do everything that I can for them, darling.
Out there, the war rages on.
Who knows how many people will die tonight and how many families torn apart?
But you and I and our daughters are still together.
Even if we have to eat porridge with tears, I will still be happy.
I hope this war will end soon so our country can be at peace and our children can finish their education.
So do I.
And when that happens
I'll make you another white silk dress and we'll have a proper wedding like the fortune teller foretold.
We must have a wedding.
When peace arrives and the hatred ends
I will bring you and our daughters back to Ha Dong village.
An.
There was one excellent essay which received the highest score.
I want the entire class to listen to it.
An...can you tell us why you chose the white silk dress as your essay topic?
My family is very poor.
Other than my mom's white silk dress, we have nothing of value.
I'm here today because of my parents' efforts, especially that of my mom.
Go ahead.
Read it.
The white silk dress which my sister and I take turns wearing to school is my parents, keepsake.
My parents, hometown is in Ha Dong village.
They immigrated to Da Nang in 1954.
The only possession my mom had when they left was this white silk dress.
However, it's no ordinary dress.
It's the wedding dress my dad offered to my mom before they came South.
My mother told me that after moving from one village to another, they finally settled in Hoi An because my mom was pregnant with me.
Then, when I was born, to commemorate their second hometown my dad named me Hoi An.
One by one, my three younger sisters were born
by the Thu Bon river in Cam Nam village where every year the tide rises to the roof of our house.
My family is very poor.
To raise four of us, my parents have to work from early morning until late at night raking mussels along the river to sell in the market.
During the flood season, they are unable to rake mussels.
Then the whole family has to eat porridge or sweet potatoes.
Sometimes even corn.
Now and then my parents give up their own portions in order for us to feel full.
But as hard it is, my mom refuses to let us quit school.
One ticket for me.
Why are you so late?
I'm sorry.
I've been waiting for you.
I finished a song and you hadn't even come back yet.
It's because of Lan.
What happened?
She asked me to watch Charlie Chaplin.
That's why I'm late.
Eat, please.
If you won't eat,
I'll give your sweet potato to my pig.
Piggy, come and eat.
Hey, Rich.
My pig already ate your sweet potato.
Eat it.
Mom will be back later to breast-feed you.
My mother often said that girls should live a life of velvet and silk.
I don't know what that means, but I think it must be very nice since she describes it that way.
I only know that my mom works very hard so that when we grow up we won't have a hard life like she did.
Order.
Everybody.
Order!
Why did you let your cow eat my notebooks?
You left your notebooks on the ground.
My cow thought they were grass.
Stupid girl!
If you,re so smart, then why are you a cow herder?
Your mom didn't have anything to eat but corn when she was pregnant with you.
Your father named you Corn.
That's why you,re so stupid!
Stupid!
Stupid!
How dare you call me stupid!
How dare you!
You dare call me stupid!
What's the matter, Corn?
I...
I spilled ink on our white silk dress.
Look, it's stained.
A helicopter suddenly flew overhead.
The noise startled me.
I accidentally knocked over the ink pot on our dress.
Mom told us that a graceful girl should know how to keep her dress clean.
What will we do now?
If Mom finds out, she will beat the both of us.
An, why is your baby sister crying?
Mom is calling.
An, what shall we do now?
An, why are you letting your baby sister cry?
Stop crying.
Let's go out and have some fun.
One day, my sister accidentally spilled ink on our dress.
She cried out of fear and that made me cry too.
We cried not because we were afraid that our mom would punish us, but because we were afraid that she would be sad.
From then on, we wouldn't be her graceful daughters anymore.
Come on, honey.
What are you three doing over there?
An is washing the dress for you, Mom.
Mom, I...
I spilled ink all over the dress.
Mom, I'm so sorry.
Please don't be sad.
And then my mom spent that whole afternoon washing our dress by the river.
It took her several scrubbings to wash out the white jackfruit sap we had put on the ink stain.
It was only because we were afraid our mom would be sad
that we unintentionally made it worse.
I regret that I was not able to keep my mom's white silk dress clean
which she had brought from Ha Dong village.
It is far from being as beautiful as my classmates, dresses
simply because my mom is not a tailor.
But if any among you had seen my mom keep herself awake all those nights by the kerosene lamp
to sew pieces of cloth into this dress so we could continue to go to school, you'd know how truly beautiful this dress is to us.
The most beautiful dress of Cam Nam village.
And nothing could make us happier or prouder than to wear our mom's wedding dress to school.
That afternoon, we watched our mom sit by the river bank and wash our dress without a word of complaint.
I love my mom very dearly.
Even though we live in poverty we are proud to be our parents, children.
We will continue to study hard and do everything we can to never disappoint them.
As for me, to repay my mom for the sacrifices she's made,
I wish to become a good tailor when I grow up so I can sew a beautiful wedding dress for her...
It's a replacement for the dress she sacrificed for us so that we could remain in school.
I've never seen her wearing a silk dress, but I know for sure that she would look beautiful in one.
My father says so as well.
I'll try my best to make my mom proud of her graceful daughter.
Daddy!
Mommy, please tell Daddy not to bury An!
Mom!
Daddy, don't bury my sister!
Mommy, tell An to wake up!
Mom!
An, I miss you so much.
You are with our beloved Buddha, aren't you?
I offer you this book so you can read stories to him, okay?
You don't have to worry,
I won't stain mom's white dress anymore.
I'll listen to you.
I'll be a decent young girl.
When you meet Buddha, tell him to wait for me... that someday I'll be with him.
Mom fixed your dress for me.
I don't have to use pins anymore.
Take a look.
Do you think it looks beautiful on me?
Honey, it's about to rain.
Let's go home.
Darling, let's paddle over there to fetch some more wood.
The rain's heavy and the tides are going to be strong.
Let's go home.
Darling, if we fetch those pieces of wood and sell the baskets of mussels we will have enough money to buy a new white dress for Corn to go to school.
Darling!
Darling!
Darling!
Dan!
Darling!
Darling!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Dan!
Be nice.
Stop crying.
I'll tell Corn to boil some corn for you, okay?
Corn, did you boil the corn?
Are they ready for Rich to eat?
Don't worry,
Mom will be back to breast-feed you soon.
Rich, come on, stop crying.
Daddy is here.
Oh, Daddy is home.
Where is Mommy?
Why didn't she come home with you?
Rich wants to be breast-feed.
I've been trying to comfort her, but I can't get her to stop crying.
Corn, Daddy is home.
Ah, Daddy is home.
Daddy, look.
I boiled the pot of corn all by myself.
Where is Mommy, Daddy?
Why are you crying?
Because you are such a good girl.
That's why I'm crying.
Where is Mommy, Daddy?
Mom will be back soon.
Mussels.
Mussels, anyone...
Mussels.
Mussels, anyone...
All Buddhist monks and students must stop their violent acts and anti-government meetings at once.
You must go back to your homes to avoid any bloodshed when our nation is experiencing grave disorder.
We are on the verge of war.
The National Leading Committee Chairman has ordered temporary closings of all schools in all grades in every town and in every village, from all districts to the main city.
The first time you kissed me,
I was proud to be a man.
When you were alive,
I was proud to be a husband.
And now that you are gone
I'm proud to be a father.
If you were still alive,
I would make you a hundred white silk dresses for our wedding.
War and natural disasters have left behind many sad memories, but your love has left me with many beautiful ones.
Daddy, what are you looking for?
He's looking for Mom.
Darling, where are you now?
Heaven or Hell ?
I hope you rest in peace.
Corn, hurry up!
Corn, hurry up!
Corn, where are you?
Hurry up!
Daddy!
Daddy!
We forgot mom's white silk dress.
Corn!
Corn!
Stop!
Daddy...
Corn, you can't go inside.
Stay here.
You stay here!
Daddy!
My mother said a white silk dress is the symbol of a Vietnamese woman's immense suffering as well as her generosity.
Through traumatic hardship, through horrific destruction caused by countless wars, the Vietnamese white silk dress still maintains its beauty.
The beauty of a Vietnamese woman cannot be characterized by white skin, rosy cheeks, and red lips,
but by the elegant laps of the white silk dress but by the elegant laps of the white silk dress
A Film Poeta Production
A DIRTY CARNIVAL
You fucking bastard.
You're a gangster?
You wanna be a gangster, too?
Let go.
Fucking bastard!
Beats up a person and throws away money.
I have to admit he's good for nothing though he's my son.
He needs years behind bars before he comes to his senses.
Stop it already.
We should be thankful they accepted our offer.
By the way, what shall we do?
We only have a month to move out.
Where can we get that much money?
I'll find a way.
No, it's okay.
I'll get the money somehow this time.
I'll get the money.
Don't worry, mom.
You wanna get sick again?
This is for Sun-ok's academy and your medication.
Do you still have chest pains?
They're tolerable.
You'd better not be seen with those scamps again.
Next time, I'm gonna break your legs.
- See you.
- Okay.
Drive safely and come by more often.
I think mom's condition's gotten worse these days.
OK.
Here.
A cell phone?
It's not for you to chat and text message with your friends
I can keep it?
Call mom whenever you're late from the academy.
- OK
- Go in.
Oh, KIM Byung-doo?
I know him well.
Really?
How do you know him?
I was in charge of the Rotary gang.
I met him then.
How do you know him?
He's my friend from elementary.
Oh, he's your friend?
Yeah.
I've been asking every policeman I met to find him
You should see him then, rather than talking to me
If it's for your movie, you should talk to the gangster himself.
I guess so.
You motherfuckers!
You think you can leave whenever you want?
You think this is some kind a club?
A fucking picnic?
Straighten up.
I'm home, boss.
Why did you bring them back if they didn't wanna be here anymore?
- Jong-soo.
- Yes, boss.
From now on, cut their fingers before they leave.
Yes, boss.
- You, youngest!
- Yes, boss.
- It's tough isn't it?
- No, it's ok, boss.
Let's bear it a little longer.
Since we're already here, might as well go all the way.
- Hey, Hippo!
- Yes, boss.
What's our philosophy?
Yes, boss.
Never lose face, never get jumped on,
Get your shoes polished even if you skip a meal.
Though we may starve to death, we should never fail to respect ourselves
So what do you become the minute you lose integrity?
A scamp.
- Am I right?
- Right, boss.
Let's try our best.
- Let's go working!
- Yes, boss.
Apartment number 108-503!
Bitch, gimme my money!
CHOI Sun-duk, Pay back if you borrowed my money!
Residents of building 108!
My family's starving because apt. 503 won't pay me back!
Who are you calling a bitch!
Honey, call the police!
Go ahead, call again.
Let's go by the fucking law.
You're going a bit too far, young man.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't have any money!
Hello?
Sun-ok?
Byung-doo?
Can you hear me?
Yup.
Got good connection.
What's up?
I forgot to say thank you for the cell phone.
Hey, go back your studying and don't waste your time calling me.
The fruit of patience is what?
It's sweet.
Gotta go, I'm working.
Damn, what are you doing?
Do it harder, make me hard.
Higher, higher.
That's right.
That's right, there.
- Get back to your room.
- Right there.
Good.
I was hurting right there.
Who are you under?
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
I'm so fucking busy getting ready for my business.
How could I fucking interrupt yours?
What?
Yeah, go ahead!
We're gonna open as planned.
Do whatever you want!
Bring your axe and shit!
Shit!
- Hey!
- Yes, boss.
Hey, why did you make it so noticeable?
Sorry, boss.
I tried my best.
We might as well clean them up for good this time, boss!
Leave it.
Don't make things big.
Take care of it at your level.
Yes, boss.
Later, boss.
Boss, is everything okay?
Yeah, the game room..
- So you got it?
- Yes, boss.
Good.
Here, this is for you.
Boss, give us a bit more.
Hey, times are difficult for me too.
Getting my only sister married costs a shit load.
A bit more, boss.
We can't even pay rent these days.
Dumb ass!
Getting cheated by your own sponsor..
Let's wait 'til things get better.
You said that before, boss.
What!
Boss, can't you just pretend you skipped a racecourse bet?
You fucking with me?
How dare you fuck with me..
Byung-doo, how old are you this year?
Twenty-nine, boss.
Twenty-nine, huh?
And look at yourself.
Still begging for money..
Shouldn't you be getting somewhere by now?
Six villas and 20% a month.
Get them notarized..
Why waste money?
We are the notary.
Then make sure you get all the right documents.
Right, boss.
How are you, boss!
Yes, Byung-doo!
Heard you did a great job.
It's nothing.
No, no, that wasn't easy money to get back.
Sang-chul's got a smart kid under him.
All my boys are smart, boss.
Byung-doo, we're about to go for a drink.
Join us.
- Don't mind me.
- Come along.
You can be boss's designated driver.
I like you cause you don't look like a gangster.
Gangsters need to look like this nowadays.
It's hard to do business looking like him.
Boss, I've been getting facials.
Byung-doo, got a sponsor?
No, boss.
Not anymore.
Things didn't work out, boss.
His sponsor flew with our investment money.
It's hell of a situation, boss.
Then why don't you let him manage the new game room?
Yes, boss.
I was thinking about that.
I love you, boss.
Hello.
Yes, I'm having a drink with some employees.
Uh?
I'm afraid I can't right now.
Yes, I know.
Yes, give me some more time.
I'm sorry.
Fucking asshole!
What a pain in the ass.
But try to work things out.
- Sang-chul.
- Yes, boss.
Why don't you take attorney PARK for me?
What?
Couldn't you quietly solve this situation?
What do you mean?
I can't sleep well knowing he's pulling my strings.
If you do it for me, got your back for the rest of your life.
Can you do it?
Boss, we'll all get fucked.
You know that boss.
I'll do anything, but an attorney..
It's a different matter.
Right.
I knew it'd be hard.
Glory Game Land
Boss.
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks for coming.
You're raking in money.
Rake in my ass.
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.
Heard you're gonna be in charge of this place.
- Yes.
- Good luck, boy.
It's a good location, all it needs is a good management.
This is just the beginning.
Soon, we'll own several of these.
We need to get a good sponsor and start making a fortune.
By the way boss, we're gonna have some trouble with the Three-Way gang.
This is their district, isn't it?
Hey, I'm going for a drink with the guests.
I'll be back soon.
- Okay, boss.
- Ok.
- Jong-soo, gimme some light.
- Yes, boss.
You've come a long way smoking in front of me.
It's a special day, boss.
Let me smoke just this one.
So you like driving that BMW?
You know it's not my car.
Son of a bitch!
Stop going around kissing boss's ass and act right.
What?
I heard you've been making trouble at Three-Way's game room.
Are you going to fight them alone if they gain up on us?
What are you scared about?
It needs to happen anyway.
Hey, this business is mine.
Don't you butt in.
Byung-doo!
Hey, Min-ho!
KIM Min-ho!
Hey, long time no see.
Yeah, it's been a while.
How long has it been, man?
I know.
It's been ages.
Hey, you still look the same.
You too, man.
I could spot you out in an instant.
Oh yeah?
So why is it so hard to see you?
I looked up everywhere to find you.
Oh yeah?
Detective WOO called this morning.
He says you're a filmmaker?
I'm working on something.
Man, it's so cool I have a friend who's a film director.
What about you Byung-doo?
How's work?
I'm running that place and doing this and that.
Heard you wanted to meet gangsters?
Yeah, I'm preparing a gangster movie.
I met some detectives
Now I need to meet some gangsters.
I don't know if it'll help.
They're just like normal people.
Still..
I need to learn about their world.
Hey, are you still keeping in touch with elementary friends?
Sure, I see them once in a while at the reunion events.
Then have you seen KANG Hyun-joo?
KANG Hyun-joo?
Yeah, I saw her at the last gathering.
You remember her?
I remember my close friends.
So, how is she doing?
I heard she works at a book store.
Yeah, Jong-soo.
What?
Son of a bitch!
You motherfucker.
Son of a bitch!
Fucking motherfuckers.
Come in all of you!
- Young-pil!
- Yes, boss.
- Call the Three-Way fucks.
- Yes, boss.
- Byung-doo!
- Yes, boss.
It's war.
Gather all the boys.
Yes, boss.
Young-pil..

What?
Stuck in traffic?
We're nearly there so get here as soon as you can!
Shit, run them over!
Motherfuckers.
Open the trunk!
Shit
Son of a bitch.
Die!
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Motherfuckers!
Boss!
What was he thinking?
Big boss made things messy gutting that boy for nothing
Boss, isn't our whole family in deep shit if he dies?
Shut up!
Let's wait 'til the boss gets things settled
Big boss'd better not forget us, after everything we did this time.
Yeah, Sun-ok.
What?
!
Why on earth would you join the demonstration?
You have any idea how dangerous they are?
You thought they'd build around our house if you protested?
What else could I do?
By the way, what happened to your face?
Were you in a fight again?
Never mind my face.
You and Byung-sik, both of you..
It's all my fault.
Don't use your fists anymore.
Wars are outdated now.
You have to use your brains, Not your sashimi knives.
Yes, boss.
So how did you settle it?
We paid some compensation and Young-pil is going in.
- Young-pil is?
- Yes, boss.
I asked him to do it for me.
So I let his boys take care of the game room.
Boss, what do you mean?
I had to do it.
It was the least I could do for him.
Boss..
Sir, attorney PARK wants to see you in the next room.
Attorney PARK's here?
Who told him I was here?
Did I make a mistake?
What shall I tell him?
Tell him I'll be there.
This asshole is a stumbling block in my life.
Boss, just have a drink with him.
Go to boss's car and wait.
Boss, can I talk to you?
What is it?
How can you do this to me?
You need to understand.
Boss, did I ever disobey you?
What is it that Young-pil did that I didn't do for you?
I know.
Next time, OK?
Boss, please just this once.
Our family is about to get thrown out to the streets.
Please reconsider, boss.
Then you wanna go in instead of Young-pil?
- See you again.
- Yeah, see you next time.
- Is boss's car ready?
- Yes, boss.
- Hey!
- Yes?
- That's this?
- Oh, he's with me.
Meet attorney PARK.
He's a gangster too then.
Hey, come over here.
Fucking gangsters..
Parasites of our society..
Loser like this should be all sucked up with a vacuum cleaner.
Why don't you leave the poor kid alone.
Hey, Myung-geun.
You're neither a civilian nor a gangster.
What are you?
A mutt?
Act straight.
Let's have a smoke.
People need to age gracefully.
Attorneys aren't easy.
How old are you?
Twenty-nine, boss.
That's when Sang-chul came.
He was quick back then.
He's come a long way..
or maybe went too far.
There's so much to do but it's hard to find someone who'll last.
You should find a good sponsor and start making real money.
You can't be a gangster forever.
Thanks for your advice, boss.
Byung-doo, you just need to know two things to be successful.
Who you need, and what he needs..
It seems Sang-chul doesn't need anything anymore.
Thanks for driving.
Good night, boss.
Think of me as your big brother.
Yes.
Go home now.
Good night.
Sorry for coming back, boss.
It's okay.
What is it?
Do you have..
a name card of that attorney?
This is serious stuff.
All our necks are on the line.
You don't have to join me.
I'll do it myself if you're not in.
How can you say such a thing.
We're both outsiders, starting out as club waiters..
When will we make our fortune living like this?
Do you think we can ever find another sponsor like this?
Jong-soo!
Yes, boss.
Trust me on this one.
Yes, boss.
I'm here because of you.
I'll go if you go.
Good.
Let's go for it.
See if you can find out anything.
Work quietly.
Mr. CHOI!
How are you?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I was waiting for you but you didn't come..
Right, we had an appointment.
Sorry, I forgot.
It's not a problem.
But, can I talk to you for a minute?
Right now?
I can't.
I have a meeting.
How about tomorrow?
See you tomorrow.
Then, have you read my scenario?
Your scenario?
Why don't you look for something else?
The story hasn't changed a bit since last time.
If it's a gangster movie, it needs something strong.
But this one..
the storyline's just bland.
Plus, there's no gangster in this gangster movie.
Look for something else.
Sir.
I'll change it..
one last time.
I'm doing real interviews with some gangsters right now.
I'll make it realistic this time.
You just wait, motherfuckers.
I'll make something huge.
Hey, you found this place.
Yeah, it wasn't hard.
What's up with you these days?
I couldn't get a hold of you..
Are you busy these days?
Yeah, the business is busy.
I'm sorry about the other day.
Things just happen and shit..
Yeah, I saw what happened.
Man, what was that fight over?
You saw?
Just the usual territory fight.
Ah!
Man, that was some action.
It's my first time seeing gangsters fight.
Did you get hurt or anything?
I'm fine.
So what is it that you had to see me so urgently
Oh, that..
I'll tell you as we go.
Go where?
Where are we going?
You'll see once we get there.
Where are you taking me..
It was such a spectacle when the fat boy got smashed.
We couldn't go that way since then thanks to this son of a bitch.
That's right.
Byung-doo, you used to be so athletic.
Don't you remember?
Our class won that relay run because of him.
Yeah, that's right.
Man, it's so good to see you again.
I know.
Yeah, come out more often.
Yeah, okay.
Help Min-ho with his film too.
It's about time he made something.
Hey, stop.
Who knows?
When he becomes famous maybe he'll bring some gorgeous actresses with him.
As if I'll have time for you guys.
You arrogant son of a bitch.
Whatever!
Hey, Min-ho,
I think I'd better go in now.
Why?
Stay a little longer.
Hyun-joo will come soon.
This prick bought it.
I guess he did.
It's a bet!
He's betting two hundred for whoever finished
- the pie in 20 seconds.
- Really?
20 seconds?
Anyone can do that!
Whoever eats it can take it.
You'd better keep your word.
- OK, two hundred!
- You guys, join us.
Alright, bring on the pie.
- Byung-doo, try it.
- Hey, let's do it.
One, two, start!
Stop!
Who's finished it?
For real?
Open your mouth.
What the..
Byung-doo, take it.
Use it to pay for the drinks.
Hey, Hyun-joo!
Sorry, sorry.
Come sit over here.
Why are you so late?
Work ended late today.
You're always late.
- You'd better pay penalty.
- Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You know how long Byung-doo waited for you?
Hey, Byung-doo.
Hey, it's been a long time.
It's so good to see you.
You still look the same.
Really?
What do you mean?
She's aged.
You wanna die?
So when are you going to get married, Hyun-joo?
Hey, ask me after you find me a man first.
Hey, you know how much Byung-doo missed you?
Really?
Hey, I never said that.
Why not?
I missed him too.
Aren't you glad you came today?
Let's see each other more often.
You know how much I missed you?
Min-ho, today's just perfect.
Yeah..
Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You rock.
Drive safely, I'll call again.
Not too close.
Run in.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Hey, what the hell is wrong with your driving?
I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off.
Don't you know any better not to drive when you're sleepy?
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the damage.
- Let me get your name card.
- Yes, sure.
Aren't you attorney PARK?
You know me?
Yeah, I'm OH Jong-soo.
Don't you remember me?
OH Jong-soo?
Have we met before?
I saw you at the Rainbow.
Why don't you eat some food as well.
The food here is really good.
Yes, boss.
You look healthier than before.
Really?
I'm working out more, running two extra kilometers.
I must live long enough to spend all that money I have.
Of course, boss.
How's getting ready for moving to the new place?
It's going well, thanks to you.
I got your back from now on so let's work as team.
I have this business plan that I might need your help in.
I'm at your service, boss.
I willing to work hard.
But you know..
it won't' be easy settling things with Sang-chul.
I know, boss.
Good.
This case worked out well thanks to you.
- Let's drink to it.
- Yes, boss.
And, one more thing..
This never happened.
Not a soul will find out.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I know, boss.
So it's ten in total?
Let's see what you have.
Flush.
Hold your horses.
A full house.
Hey, good timing.
Go get some money.
They were meeting together.
The fucking son of a bitch.
He dares to leave me out?
I think Byung-doo did attorney PARK as you said.
I'm sorry it's been so long.
How's your health?
It's just so-so.
I need to cope with it.
Still, you'll get better soon.
Mom, remember how he used to be so considerate.
I told him not to come, but he kept on insisting that he wanted to see you.
Really?
Thank you.
I heard you've become a filmmaker?
Yes.
I'm so happy for you.
Poor Byung-doo couldn't finish school because of me.
Mom, you don't need to say that here.
Byung-doo's far better off than I am.
You've got yourself a good son.
You'd better tell some good stories to our director here.
Yes, boss.
Tell him everything.
Ask them anything you want to know.
Okay.
If you want juicy stuff, ask him.
He's had it rough.
He can stab you while smiling.
Jong-soo boss cried last night watching a TV drama.
You fucking ass, shut up!
Hey, watch it.
We have a guest here.
Sorry boss.
Oh, it's ok.
Jong-soo, what is that tattoo of?
It's interesting.
It's a forget-me-not.
Boss waters it sometimes like this..
Boss, my tattoo is prettier.
Hong-man's been watching over big boss's gang and says
Young-pil went down to Young-gwang today.
To Young-gwang?
Yeah, he didn't meet anyone in particular.
Just looked around.
Something's fishy.
When's Young-pil going in?
I heard after the big boss's sister's wedding.
Myung-goo, what do you want to do when you climb up in rank.
I want to find a good sponsor and make a fortune.
I wish to buy my own apartment someday.
Myung-goo and Hong-man are petite.
What made you wanna be a gangster?
Why boss, size doesn't matter.
The days of fattening up eating dog food and shit are over.
These days, you can't survive like that.
You need brains and skills these days.
Gangsters need to study to read documents.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, how may I help you?
Byung-doo!
Wow that's a lot of books there.
You read all of it?
Just the titles.
Hey, what happened last time?
You left in the middle of it.
Oh, something came up.
Hey, so how long have you been working here?
7-8 years.
Oh really?
Your legs must hurt from standing all day.
Well, that's how it is.
So, how's your mother?
She's doing well.
I remember she used to cook red bean noodles for me.
I crave it sometimes.
You have good memory.
Come over whenever you crave it.
Hey, so you're not dating anyone?
Nope.
And you?
Me?
I was too busy thinking of you.
Yeah right.
I'm serious.
Anyway, it's really nice to see you again.
Yeah.
Hey, I heard about what you do for living.
What did you hear?
That I'm a gangster?
- Yeah, Young-pil.
- Boss wants to see you.
- What?
- He said right now.
- Right now?
- Yes, boss.
- I see.
- Hurry up.
Alright.
You know what?
I need to get back to work.
Yeah.
Hey, is it okay if I came by once in a while?
No, why don't you call me when you're around here.
Why?
I don't want my friends to see me at work.
Alright.
- OK, bye.
- Bye.
- Come on in.
- You asked for me, boss?
Here's the wedding invitation.
Wow.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Sit down.
It's sad sending her off.
- So have you heard?
- Heard what?
Attorney PARK's missing.
Who?
Attorney PARK!
You met him in front of that karaoke.
Cops came by because of that.
Don't know why they're linking me with his absence.
What gangster in his sane mind would do that?
Knowing it would kill the whole organization.
Don't you agree?
Of course, boss.
By the way, go to Young-gwang this weekend after the wedding.
Young-gwang?
Do you remember Mr. JANG?
Go collect money from him.
Yes, boss.
Since that game room didn't work out for you, you can use half of it.
It'll be enough for you and your boys too.
Thanks, boss.
I kind of let you guys drift alone, didn't I?
It's hard with all these boys looking up to me.
I miss those days when we used to drought it together.
Yes, boss.
I want you to tell me if you feel like you're being mistreated.
You're the only one I have left, with Young-pil's going in soon.
He's done attorney PARK
Yes.
Then you should finish him off and teach Mr. HWANG a lesson.
I don't want to shed blood before the wedding.
He's going after the wedding so go after him and work quietly
Yes, boss.
This is melting in my mouth.
Boss, you should try some.
- Yeah, you go ahead eat.
- Okay.
This is for you guys.
Where is this from?
Get yourselves a new suit.
Thank you boss!
Let me ask you something.
What is a family?
What does a family mean to you?
Um, a family is like this, like us, boss.
A family is a mouth that eats from the same table.
One mouth, two..
three, four..
five, six..
seven including myself
We are all one mouth.
- Understood?
- Yes, boss.
Then, what about the asshole that wants to eat alone?
He's not a part of the family.
He's a fucking stranger.
Am I right?
Yes, boss!
I think the boss knows.
Then we should hurry, boss.
It has to be done anyway.
We could get fucked before them if we wait too long.
Thank you.
Boss, nice to see you.
- How are you, boss?
- Ah, welcome.
- Congratulations, boss.
- Welcome.
Thanks.
They said it might rain, but I'm glad it isn't, boss.
Yeah, I know.
You must be missing her already, boss.
It's about time she got married.
Everyone, look over here.
One, two..
Thank you.
Would the friends of the groom and the bride come out to take a picture at the front of the aisle.
How's the food?
Thanks a lot!
- Boss.
- Yeah.
The car is ready.
Yeah, escort them to the airport
- and drive safely.
- Yes, boss.
Hey, Mr. NOH, come over here.
Man, it's so hard to see you around.
Yeah, long time no see.
Here, sit down.
I need to greet the guests first.
- Have a drink before you go.
- Man, I can't resist.
The groom looks smart.
I heard he's from a good family.
So he's a fair match for my sister.
Of course, boss..
Well, I'm heading off to the airport, so I'll join you when I get back.
It's the least I can do for my boss.
You son of a bitch.
Alright.
Okay, see you later.
So how many years are you going in for?
Why don't you take all that money you're managing..
and leave the country for a few years?
Boss, you wanna die here or leave?
Hey, you have a drink too.
Hold on.
Boss, it seems there are more guests than expected.
I know.
Hey, nice suit.
Thanks.
It's a special day.
Shouldn't you be getting married soon too?
Not anytime soon, boss.
So when shall I visit Mr. JANG?
Huh?
Oh yeah, go tomorrow.
Mr. JANG isn't going to be easy to collect money from.
That's why appointed you to do the job.
Isn't that yours?
Oh, yes.
I don't know what to do with that gang.
Don't worry boss, I'll handle it.
- Okay.
- Long time no see, boss.
Who are you?
I met you at the funeral last time.
I'm with the Rotary gang, boss.
Oh, you're under Sang-chul.
How are you?
Doing great, boss.
Did you enjoy the food, boss?
Wedding food's always the same.
Then drink as much as you want.
We've prepared enough of it.
I guess Sang-chul boss is doing pretty well.
So many families came.
Sang-chul's always in good terms with everyone.
His boys are pretty smart too.
I heard someone's going in because of the game room.
Young-pil's supposed to go in.
When is he going in?
Right after the wedding, boss.
Is Sang-chul treating your family well too?
Of course, boss.
I see.
Yeah.
Good.
Let's finish it.
- Are we set?
- Yup.
- Okay, let's go.
- Yup.
I'll go with the driver and start unpacking.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Sun-ok might get lost later so wait for her at the bus stop.
Okay.
Let's go, mom.
Wait a minute.
Let me finish cleaning up.
You don't need to do that.
Of course I do.
One must clean after his place.
By the way, why are the cops coming for you these days?
Why are you being questioned?
What have you done?
I wish you'd stop living like that and start leading a normal life.
Can you stop.
And don't worry.
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'll find that book for you.
Could you come this way?
It's your book!
Would you want me to reserve the other book for you?
Yes, please.
We'll call you when it arrives.
Thank you.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
- This is all I could find.
- Thanks.
- Your boyfriend?
- No.
- He's good looking.
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
- Try this book.
- Okay.
So if I read this, it'll help us with our teamwork?
That's what the title implies.
Sounds nice.
I should buy more of it.
Hey, let's have dinner tonight.
Dinner?
- You're buying?
- Of course.
You'd better treat me to something delicious.
Miss KANG, what are you doing here?
Customers are waiting.
He's a customer too.
I'll be there soon.
Right now!
You're not eating any more?
I'm full.
I was going to treat you to something fancier.
Why noodles?
I just felt like it.
It's good.
By the way, what was that at the bookstore?
He was an ass.
Don't mind him.
Hey, why did you buy so many books?
They're for my employees.
I have an office now.
What kind of office?
I'm starting a real estate business.
Really?
I heard you're helping Min-ho with his movie.
I'm not much of a help.
I just told him some stories of how we live.
Hyun-joo, do you remember?
Remember what?
How we won first place in the relay race at school?
Yeah, of course I remember.
We used to stay after school to practice.
It was a lot of fun.
Yeah
We used to go to Min-ho's place for noodles afterwards.
Yeah, we did.
Byung-doo.
Don't get offended by what I'm about to say..
but I still can't believe you're doing that for living.
What?
I can't picture you as a gangster knowing how you used to be.
Hyun-joo.
Gangster's just a label.
I'm not as bad as you think.
You'll find out as you see me more often.
I guess Hyun-joo thinks of you a lot, sending you this.
What kind of tree is this?
It doesn't have branches.
It's a Lucky Tree.
It rarely blossoms but if it does, something good's supposed to happen.
I hope it blossoms so you can make a fortune.
A Lucky Tree.
Man, she's a woman of wit.
- Hey, Hippo.
- Yes, boss.
Take special care of that.
If you let it die, you die with it.
Yes, boss.
Hey, Byung-doo.
You must've landed a good sponsor.
No, some boss helped me out.
Oh yeah, that boss has a daughter who wants to be an actress.
Can you cast her for your movie?
Why not.
If it's your request,
I'll meet her next time.
Do you need help?
You have something chique and comfortable at the same time?
What size does the lady wear?
Try to find one this length.
- I'm sorry?
- This length.
Let's have a talk with dinner.
Why not?
Here are in front of company.
Let's have a talk.
I said no.
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong with you?
You can't do this to me.
You're not supposed to do this anymore.
Not do what?
Hyun-joo, let's start again.
I said I'll try harder.
Does your wife know you're still doing this?
Why are you mentioning her?
This is about us.
I don't want to talk with you.
Give me my purse.
Why are you avoiding me?
Give it back to me.
You can't leave until we're done talking.
Give it back.
- Let's talk this over.
- Hyun-joo.
Hey man, she said she wants to go.
What?
Who is this?
I'm Hyun-joo's friend.
A friend?
So what?
Byung-doo, let's go.
Give me my purse.
Oh.. so there was a reason..
All that was for him?
- Hey man.
- Hey man?
Can't you see I have something to discuss with Hyun-joo?
Discuss what?
She said no.
It's okay, let's go.
Hyun-joo.
Wait in my car.
Go to my car.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Give me the purse.
Give it to me!
You son of a bitch..
Hey, hold right there!
I said hold right there!
Fucking son of a bitch!
You motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!
What's wrong?
- Let me go.
- What did I do wrong?
- Was it that bad what I did?
- What?
You saw what happened.
He asked for it.
I'm sorry if it scared you.
But I'm not sorry for him.
Don't come to see me anymore.
What?
I don't like gangsters.
So don't come to see me.
What are you saying?
You scare me.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Hey, you can't sit there forever.
Go home now.
I said someone's coming.
Nobody's coming.
Shit, just wait and see.
Hey, Byung-doo, Byung-doo.
Man, you're so fucking heavy.
Why did you drink so much?
- Min-ho..
- What?
Shit..
Why is life so fucking hard?
What are you talking about?
Life sucks.
Hey, you really not gonna eat?
No.
I'm staying over tonight.
It's messy like your place so make yourself at home.
I remember when I used to deliver for your restaurant.
Your mom used to hate seeing you hanging out with me.
Really?
The owner's son and the delivery boy, both pathetic.
Man, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said such a thing.
No, it's okay.
It's true what you said.
Did you find the picture we talked about last time?
The picture?
Yeah.
I was going to give it to you.
Isn't Hyun-joo really cute?
Hey, how are things going between you guys?
Min-ho, do I scare you too?
Why?
Did someone say you're scary?
I..
I never regretted being a gangster but today,
I feel shitty.
You're really weird today.
Did something happen?
Just thought I shouldn't be doing things I was doing.
I tried everything to make money..
doing dirty work with sashimi knife.
Still, nothing changed about this shitty life.
I don't know what happened but you're not the only one.
I've been living like this for 3 years to make a movie.
Hey, did you really use a sashimi knife?
Why?
It sounds so unreal.
May because you're my friend.
When did you get that scar on your shoulder?
This?
You know..
when I was fighting over that game room.
Ah..
Is that scar from a knife?
Yeah.
I wonder what it's like being stabbed.
Have you ever stabbed anyone?
I'm no different from the rest.
What does it feel like?
Stabbing?
Feels like shit.
You're not yourself when you do it.
Yeah.
I can't imagine it.
That's why you shouldn't look into their eyes..
If you do, it will haunt you
for the rest of your life.
Nobody will understand..
I can't get it out of my mind.
Hey, who did you stab?
What's wrong with you today?
This is the bird's eye view of the apartment complex.
The total sales profit will be around 451 .8 billion won and the cost of land, construction, and selling..
All those will be replaced by beautiful apartments.
A shopping mall over there and a subway line there.
Imagine the scale of money selling 1,500 units.
We'll get at least five hundred if everything works out well.
Five hundred units?
I can't imagine it, boss.
It could be more.
But it won't be easy driving out the locals.
The landlords probably heard about the development by now.
They'll expect compensation.
You think you can handle it?
Yes, I'll do it, boss.
Good.
If you help me dig those grounds,
I'll give you 50 units.
- Really, boss?
- Of course.
I'm here because of you.
I'll make sure it happens.
Your scenario was good.
Why didn't you do it sooner?
Pardon me?
I guess all those interviews paid off.
The characters seemed real and the story's good.
Oh, really?
- Let's do it.
- What?
Let's get the actors together and start tomorrow.
Ah, yeah.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Lady, sell it.
Shit, you're holding up our construction business.
Should we come by at night and bury her?
Boss, let's do that.
I know a good mountain for digging.
Things will only get worse.
We'll pay you some extra.
How many times do I need to tell you.
I can't sell it.
I lived here for 30 years and it's all I've got for my sons
So your second son is a senior in high school?
Excuse me?
Boss, we couldn't find the owners of the five houses.
They're probably hiding.
I think the Serpents' got them.
I guess they want a part in this too.
The matter's serious if it's the Serpents though.
My boys will find those five landlords soon.
As long as we find one, the rest will come out easy.
Do it quietly.
An all-out war isn't easy.
- Yes, boss.
- Your guest has arrived.
- Hey, Min-ho.
Come here.
- Hello, director KIM.
Welcome.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to ask you to come when you must be so busy.
It's no problem.
I heard a lot about you from Byung-doo.
He seems very proud of you.
Really?
How's it coming along?
We'll go into shooting soon.
First of all, congratulations.
And thanks for casting my daughter.
She's good for the role.
Byung-doo helped me it's the least I could do.
It'd better be a big hit.
Thanks.
You can count on me, boss.
Make a blockbuster, Min-ho.
May I help you?
Do you know where Ms. KANG Hyun-joo is?
She didn't come to work today.
I'm a friend of hers.
Could you give this to her for me?
She's sick, so she's taking some days off.
Really?
Hyun-joo!
Open the door.
I said open the door!
Come out!
Open the door.
You'd better open the door.
I'm gonna break in.
Hyun-joo!
Is she okay?
The doctor will be here soon.
Why didn't you call home if you were this sick?
I must say this is excellent although I made it.
I used to get beat to get the recipe right for this.
Try it.
Try just a bite then, for my sake.
Why are you crying?
Eat so you can recover.
What the..?
This is expensive, you know.
100% natural honey..
Man, it's sweet!
It's sweet, ain't it?
There are lots of ants and digger bees in this mountain.
Won't it be nice to see happens for a few days?
Where's are they?
Did we get everything?
Things got complicated, boss.
Why?
I was just working on those five and it seems Serpent's got the papers himself.
What?
Serpent has them?
Fucking son of a bitch.
What shall we do, boss?
Kill them, until they tell you where Serpent is.
Yes, boss.
Who are you?
Mr. KIM, it's not polite to mess with others' business.
Who the fuck are you?
Your mother seemed ill.
Who are you?
And isn't it dangerous after dark for a pretty girl like your sister?
Byung-doo, what's wrong?
What's going on?
Sun-ok, hurry up and pack.
We're leaving right now.
Mom says she's not going.
What's happening?
Stay at uncle's place for a few days.
Where's Byung-sik?
He hasn't come home in a couple of days.
That son of a bitch.
Hurry, what are you doing?
I'm not leaving my house.
What did you do this time?
Just listen to me this once.
I can't deal with this anymore.
First it was cops, now we have to hide from gangsters?
We can manage on our own, go hide by yourself.
Your bad example messed up Byung-sik as well.
Shit!
You think I come here because I want to?
Who's gonna take care of Byung-sik and Sun-ok?
Stop shouting at mom.
I won't ask you to take care of us.
So get out!
Okay, I'll leave
So do whatever you want.
Where are they, boss?
Call Jong-soo and tell him to send some boys over to my house.
Yes, boss.
Yes!
We'll take care of them.
We'll bury them as soon as we find out where they are.
Okay, boss.
What did the boss say?
To finish everything tonight.
Okay.
Since they love land so much, we'll bury them.
We'll do what they did to our boys, when we find them.
Of course.
Can't believe we're going through all this trouble for Axe.
He shouldn't have got caught by them.
Boss, won't we get something for rescuing all of them?
I'm sure we will as soon as the boss gets things settled.
You know, Axe is a fucking psycho.
Remember when we went to collect money from Royal Billiards?
Axe forgot to bury him afterwards.
Lighter, lighter.
When we went back the tide water had already reached right below his eyes.
He could've died.
Isn't he a dumb ass, boss?
It gets even better.
When we got there, he looking up at me with these sad pleading eyes.
Then all of a sudden a stream of water shot out of nowhere.
You know what it was?
Eui-jung was pissing on him.
Isn't that something?
He must've been pissing in his pants himself.
I'm sure he was, boss.
All those Mokpo bitches are in the past, boss.
You lying bitch..
What?
What the..
Stop the car!
Motherfucker!
Where's Serpent?
Stay still, bitch.
Hurry, get him in the car.
This is Serpent's.
These are the rest of the landlords.
The land is open for construction now.
Good job.
You're ruthless.
What about the Serpents?
They're resolved for good?
Of course, boss.
After the authorization, we're set for good.
Don't forget about my share, boss.
Of course, you'll get your share.
- Cut
- It's a cut.
It's very different from real life..
I know, boss.
Practice!
Everything nice and all, but actions seem too sophisticated.
Can't we get it a bit more realistic?
Realistic?
How?
Maybe you can take out that jumping round kick.
You said it was okay on the first round.
You should've said it earlier then.
Now we have to change the whole routine.
This just isn't the type of action I was thinking of..
OK then, no jumping round kick.
What else?
I don't know what you want so tell me specifically.
- Min-ho.
- Yes.
He's the martial arts choreographer?
Yeah, why?
Hi, I was just watching.
I'm sorry to butt in, but the fight doesn't seem real.
Min-ho, real gangsters don't fight like this.
Hey, Jong-soo!
Come over here.
- Hurry up.
- Yes, boss.
Stand right here.
You see.
A punch should always fly low.
Keep it low and give it a sting at the end.
Like this.
This is how you do it.
I'm fine but the crew seems to feel a bit uncomfortable.
I guess I made a mistake.
I was only trying to help.
I know.
They're all really sensitive right now with stress.
Yeah, then I'll head off.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you soon
When it's all over.
Yeah, good luck with the rest of the shooting.
Min-ho!
Make something with a real gangster spirit.
See you.
You're off early today.
It's been a while.
How were you?
You feel better now?
I'm much better now.
Good.
You don't seem happy to see me.
People are watching, hurry, take it.
Actually, I went the book shop several times to see you.
But I couldn't say hi to you.
Thought you'd feel uncomfortable.
But I'm glad you look better.
Oh yeah, thank you for the other day.
You're a good cook.
Yeah, then get sick again.
So I can cook for you again.
How do you like this place?
It's really nice to be out after working inside all day.
It's like another world, another life in there.
I'll take you to a better place next time.
I saw you wearing new shoes.
Does it fit?
How did you know my size?
Just an eye measurement.
I'm always receiving things from you.
What is it?
What's the event?
Nothing..
I just wanted to celebrate something.
Enjoy your cake..
What did you want to celebrate?
Remember you sent me a Lucky tree?
It blossomed today.
Really?
That's really rare.
Yeah I know, but it did.
If something good really happens, it's because of you.
I had fun today.
Getting some fresh air..
You're a good conversationist and smiled a lot too today.
You helped me.
I haven't had such a good time in a while.
- Really?
- Yeah!
Yeah.
Next time, I'm buying.
Cool.
Don't you invite me for a cup of coffee?
Coffee?
It's too late tonight.
I'll make it for you next time.
Okay.
I can't believe it's time to go already.
Drive safely.
And thanks for the flowers.
Yup.
Hyun-joo!
Hold on.
Hyun-joo, can I like you?
You still hate me?
No, it's just..
I'm not sure..
Hyun-joo, if you want,
I can quit being a gangster.
To tell you the truth, I've never liked anyone but you.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
Congratulations.
Seems like a hit.
- Hey, thanks.
- Min-ho.
- You're here.
- You did a great job.
Everybody's talking about how good the movie it.
It's good.
It's a good piece of work.
Really?
You must work with me next time then.
Thank you.
Director!
Hey, Ji-ae
- Hello, Director.
- Hi.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for coming.
Did Ji-ae cause you trouble?
No, she was great.
Director, I think it's a hit.
Everyone's talking about it.
Yeah.
I wish you best of luck.
By the way, didn't you invite Byung-doo?
I tried calling him but he wouldn't pick up.
Right, he's so busy these days with work.
I see.
Let's have a drink sometime.
Sure.
Have more.
I hope you like it.
It tastes exactly like when I had it in elementary.
I'm glad.
Take some home with you.
She's made plenty.
It's not worth taking home.
Hyun-joo, come over often.
Okay.
A tip for my sister-in-law, it tastes better with salt and sugar.
You're embarrassing her.
It's my wishful thinking.
Byung-doo, you'd like that too.
You've become a different person ever since you've been dating her.
No I haven't.
Your brother always talks about you.
How pretty and smart you are.
Really?
I'm so happy you're with him.
He has a good heart.
Always bringing all sorts of medicine.
You need to get well soon.
Yes, boss.
Where are you?
I'm having dinner with my family.
So oblivious..
Pardon?
Are you alright?
What kind of driving is that?
I'm sorry, I had a small drink..
I'm sorry.
What?
You're driving drunk?
Let me see your license.
I don't have one.
Then let me see your ID.
I don't have that either.
No ID?
What kind of person would drive without a license?
- You know who I am?
- I sure do.
Hello, attorney Choi!
Long time no see.
Who did you do it to?
Go ahead and tell me.
Min-ho.
I took my boss.
Why?
There must've been a reason for taking him.
You wouldn't do that to your boss for no reason.
You can't tell anyone about this..
How far does he know?
I didn't mention anything about you.
Trust me, boss.
Are you out of your mind?
How could you tell him?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
Why did Sang-chul end up that way?
What will happen if your friend went about telling everyone?
He won't do such a thing, boss.
How can you be sure?
You did it.
You clean it up.
Look over here, good.
Okay, once more.
Now, hold your fists, pose like a gangster.
Smile a little more.
A little more, good!
Your characters are very real.
Did you interview real gangsters?
I watched a lot of gangster movies like "THE GODFATHER" and "SCARFACE".
I'm sorry, I should've called you.
Why did you do that?
I trusted you when I told you that.
You shouldn't have done it if you considered me your friend.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, but..
Sorry?
What if this ruins me?
You don't give a fuck, do you?
Hey, listen to me.
Listen to what?
I thought hard about it.
I figured it would be harmless.
Everyone knows about the case and anyone could've don
You've watched it too.
It's not about you.
I made it up.
Think about it.
Kim Mim-ho.
Okay, let's say it was my mistake.
But gangsters can do anything to cover their mistakes.
You wondered what it'd be like being stabbed.
Let me say just one thing.
Shut up for the rest of your life.
Okay?
Can you do that?
Yes.
I'll take it to my grave.
If something happens, I'm not going down alone.
Got it?
You trust him?
I don't.
He even made it into a movie.
I said I got it under control.
Stop talking about it.
And start gathering boys for the model house.
If you can't do it because he's your friend,
I'll do it.
What?
Leave it up to me.
You son of a bitch!
You stay out of this.
What do you mean, stay out of it, boss?
It's my business so you can stay out of it!
Boss, this isn't just about you.
Our whole family's on the line.
Why are you covering for that fucking bastard?
Will you take care of us, if we all get fucked up?
You son of a bitch!
Shit.
I'll fucking shut you up.
Didn't I say I got it under control?
Don't you ever mention that in front of me again.
Long time no see, boss.
Stop.
Boss.. how could you?
Unlike our boss,
I don't know you very well,
Ain't that so you pussy.
Sorry to worry you, boss.
I got everything under control now.
- Don't make another mistake.
- Yes, boss.
Model house and sales start next week.
So be prepared.
Yes, boss.
Our boss saved you this time.
But we'll be watching you.
Better keep your mouth shut.
We're on the same boat now.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your help.
It's doing well.
Yes, I'm glad.
What was the competition rate for sales contract until yesterday?
It was 50 to 1 until this morning.
I knew it would do well.
- You did?
- Thank you.
We brought more boys.
Set them over there to lift the atmosphere.
- Okay.
- Okay, boss.
Mr. HWANG, the competition is now 70 to 1.
The banks are panicking.
They running out of applications.
Good, keep checking!
Congratulations, boss.
It's a huge success.
You did a lot of work.
Prepare a big feast for the employees tonight.
Let's go in.
Digger!
Hey, Myung-goo!
What is a family?
It's a mouth that eats from the same table.
That's right.
Our family will go all the way!
Everybody!
I enjoyed your movie.
I was so realistic.
So, why did you call me?
Is something troubling you?
Byung-doo!
Can you come with me?
What is it?
What's the good news?
Tell me.
Not here, come with me.
I'm busy right now.
How about after work?
I can't wait that long.
What is it?
Tell me!
I wanted to say it in a better setting.
Take this first.
- What is it?
- Open it.
- KIM Byung-doo!
- Stop!
- Stay right there!
- Move!
Don't move!
- Catch him!
- Shit!
- Stop!
- Stop!
Move!
Fuck!
Move!
Freeze!
Go around, go around!
Boss, sorry to come by like this.
Jong-gyu, step outside for a while.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, boss.
So what is your plan?
You're gonna hide forever?
I'll clean up the mess since I caused it.
I'll take Min-ho.
What?
I'll finish him and I'll leave the country too.
He's big now.
Things can get more complicated.
I can do it, boss.
Just make sure you give me my share.
It's all my family can depend on.
Just in case things go wrong,
I won't mention your name.
The movie broke the record and sold five million tickets.
Thank you again.
Now let me introduce director KIM Min-ho.
Hello, I'm KIM Min-ho, the director of the movie.
I'm happy to meet all of you.
Thank you for watching our movie.
There were some difficult moments in making this movie, but I never dreamed a day like this would come.
- Yeah, Jong-soo.
- We are arrived.
I'll be right there.
It was crazy going into that theater.
I'm glad we hired those bodyguards.
Thanks detective!
Why do you look so down?
You should cheer up on a day like this.
Let's have a drink.
Come on, director!
Let's have a drink.
I don't want to ruin this, but I should leave now.
- You can't leave!
- No you can't, director!
We're going clubbing after this.
Come on!
I feel ashamed..
Letting you guys down..
I should've listened to you.
That was my biggest mistake.
What good is it to regret the past, boss?
We just need to try solving it.
After this, while I'm gone, you guys live quietly for 2 years.
And be a good boss to the boys while I'm gone.
- Okay, boss.
- Boss!
How are you?
Good, what's going on?
They're about to go somewhere else.
Okay.
I'll go ahead, you wait outside.
Be careful, boss.
- Is this on you?
- I told you, everything's on me!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Director, you need to drink with us!
- Sang-hee, make him drink.
- Come on, director!
Director, let's do a love shot!
Love shot!
Love shot!
There you go, you can drink!
The best director!
You must be tired.
You must be more tired than me, detective.
I'm used to this, it's my job.
Detective, why don't you have a drink with us too?
Oh no, I'm fine.
I met him when I went to the station.
He's been a lot of help.
Hold on.
- Yes?
- Director, where are you?
Me?
Director, where were you?
I was in the men's room.
Come on!
Let's go dance.
No, not me.
You have to go with us.
- Let's go together.
- No, I'm okay.
Close all the exits!
We've got Min-ho, boss.
Really?
Okay, I'll meet you there.
I'm here.
Where are you?
Catch him!
Son of a bitch!
Fucking..
Who are you?
Fucking
Catch him!
Son of a bitch!
Boss!
What's going on?
Boss, something went wrong.
Let's clean up.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.
We're nearly there.
What?
What do you mean?
Yes, boss.
- Turn the car around.
- Yes, boss.
Thank you
I'll see you at the house after the funeral.
Yes, boss.
Thank you.
Bye.
You came..
Go in and call me.
Has Byung-doo called?
Not since his last text message a few days ago..
Really?
Don't worry too much.
He'll come back soon.
Yeah.
- Okay, take care.
- Bye.
- You go ahead drink first.
- Yes, sir.
So what is your next movie going to be about?
I haven't decided yet.
How about my past love story?
Excuse me?
You see, I've had a hell of a drama in my love life.
Oh, I see..
Let's meet often to talk about it.
If you like the story, you don't need to worry about the money.
Since you're good at making up stories,
I think you'll do it well.
Oh, no, no, really..
But don't make it too similar, my wife might kill me.
Yup, a fiction will always be a fiction.
- Your guest has arrived.
- How are you, boss?
Good.
Come on in.
What are you waiting for?
Bring them in!
I'll bring them right in.
They're important guest, so treat them as you best clients.
Of course.
You know Jong-soo?
Yes.
You know the director?
Yes, boss.
I know him well.
Since you won't be in Seoul for a while, drink up and enjoy.
Thank you, boss.
And congratulations for winning the award.
Let's forget the past and start fresh.
Cheers!
This is one of my favourite songs.
The lyrics are good.
Hey, Min-ho.
Make something with a real gangster spirit.
Bye!

You fucking bastard, you think you're a gangster?
You wanna be a gangster too?
Fucking bastard!
Let go.
Beats up a person and throws away money.
I have to admit he's good for nothing though he's my son.
He's out of his mind!
He needs years behind bars before he comes to his senses
Stop it already.
We should be thankful they accepted our offer.
By the way, what shall we do?
We only have a month to move out.
Where can we get that much money?
I'll find a way.
No, it's okay.
I'll get the money somehow this time.
Don't worry mom, I said I'll take care of it.
You wanna get sick again?
This is for Sun-ok's academy and your medication.
Do you still have chest pains?
They're tolerable.
You'd better not be seen with those scamps again.
Next time, I'm gonna break your legs.
- See ya.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Drive safely and come by more often.
I think mom's condition's gotten worse these days.
OK.
Here.
A cell phone?
It's not for you to chat and text message with your friends
I can keep it?
Call mom whenever you're late from the academy.
OK
Go in.
Oh, KIM Byung-doo?
I know him well.
Really?
How do you know him?
I was in charge of the Rotary gang.
I met him then.
How do you know him?
He's my friend from elementary.
Oh, he's your friend?
Yeah.
I've been asking every policeman I met to find him
Then, good for you.
You should see him then, rather than talking to me
If it's for your movie, you should talk to the gangster himself.
I guess so.
You motherfuckers!
You think you can leave whenever you want?
You think this is some kinda club?
A fucking picnic?
Straigthen up.
Hello, boss.
Why did you bring them back if they didn't we anymore?
- Jong-soo.
- Yes, boss.
From now on, cut their fingers before they leave.
Yes, boss.
- You, youngest!
- Yes, boss.
- It's tough isn't it?
- No, it's ok, boss.
Let's bear it a little longer.
Since we're already here, might as well go all the way.
- Hey, Hippo!
- Yes, boss.
What's our philosophy?
Yes, boss.
Never lose face, never getjumped on,
Get your shoes polished even if you skip a meal.
Though we may starve to death, we should never faiI to respect ourselves
So what do you become the minute you lose integrity?
A scamp!
Am I right?
- Yes, boss.
- Right, boss.
Let's try our best.
Everybody cheer up.
Let's go working!
Yes, boss.
Apartment number 108-503!
Bitch, gimme my money!
CHOl Sun-duk!
Pay back if you borrowed my money!
Residents of building 108!
My family's starving because Apt. 503 won't pay me back!
Who are you calling a bitch!
Honey, call the police!
Go ahead, call again.
Let's go by the fucking law.
You're going a bit too far, young man.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't have any money!
Hello?
Sun-ok?
Byung-doo?
Can you hear me?
Yup.
Got good connection.
What's up?
I forgot to say thank you for the cell phone.
Hey, go back your studying and don't waste your time calling me.
The fruit of patience is what?
It's sweet.
Gotta go, I'm working.
Damn, what are you doing?
Do it harder, make me hard.
Higher, higher, that's right.
- Right there.
Good.
- Get back to your room.
I was hurting right there.
Today it's chrysanthemum, tomorrow it's rose.
You'll fall asleep tired from flirting!
I'm tired of waiting, Digger Digger!
Tired of collecting money, Digger!
I'm so lonely tonight oh no!
Who are you under?
Fucking son of a bitch.
I'm so fucking busy getting ready for my business, how could I fucking interrupt yours?
Fucking dick heads!
What?
Yeah, go ahead!
We're gonna open as planned.
Do whatever you want!
Bring your axe and shit!
- Hey!
- Yes, boss.
why did you make it so noticeable?
Sorry, boss.
I tried my best.
We might as well clean them up for good this time, boss!
Leave it.
Don't make things big.
Take care of it at your level.
Yes, boss.
Later, boss.
Boss, is everything okay?
Yeah, the game room...
so you got it?
Yes, boss.
Good.
Here, this is for you.
Boss, give us a bit more.
Hey, times are difficult for me too.
Getting my only sister married costs a shit load.
A bit more, boss.
We can't even pay rent these days.
Dumb ass, getting cheated by your own sponsor...
Let's wait til things get better.
You said that before, boss.
What!
Boss, can't you just pretend you skipped a racecourse bet?
You fucking with me?
How dare you fuck with me...
Byung-doo, how old are you this year?
Twenty-nine, boss.
Twenty-nine, huh?
And look at yourself.
Still begging for money...
Shouldn't you be getting somewhere by now?
Six villas and 20% a month.
Get them notarized...
Why waste money?
We are the notary.
Then make sure you get all the right documents.
Right, boss.
How are you, boss!
Yes, Byung-doo!
Heard you did a greatjob.
It's nothing.
No, no, That wasn't easy money to get back.
Sang-chuI's got a smart kid under him.
All my boys are smart, boss.
Byung-doo, we're about to go for a drink.
Join us.
Don't mind me.
Come along.
You can be boss's designated driver.
I like you cause you don't look like a gangster.
Gangsters need to look like this nowadays.
It's hard to do business looking like him.
Boss, I've been getting facials.
Byung-doo, got a sponsor?
No boss.
Not anymore.
Things didn't work out, boss.
His sponsor flew with our investment money.
It's hell of a situation, boss.
Then why don't you let him manage the new game room?
Yes, boss.
I was thinking about that.
I love you, boss.
Oh my god, oh my god, don't do this to me.
A girl's heart is like a reed.
Don't do this.
Don't ask.
Don't ask any more.
Hello.
Yes, I'm having a drink with some employees.
I'm afraid I can't right now.
Yes.
Give me some more time.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
I can't believe I love you.
Though you're not a knight in a shining armor
Fucking asshole!
What a pain in the ass.
But try to work things out.
- Sang-chuI.
- Yes, boss.
Why don't you take attorney PARK for me?
What?
Couldn't you quietly solve this situation?
What do you mean?
I can't sleep well knowing he's pulling my strings.
If you do it for me, I got your back for the rest of your life.
Can you do it?
Boss, we'll all get fucked.
You know that boss.
I'll do anything, but an attorney...
It's a different matter.
Right.
I knew it'd be hard.
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks.
You're raking in money.
Rake in my ass.
- Thanks for coming.
- Okay.
Heard you're gonna be in charge of this place.
- Yes.
- Good luck, boy.
It's a good location, all it needs is a good management.
This is just the beginning.
Soon, we'll own several of these.
We need to get a good sponsor and start making a fortune.
By the way boss, we're gonna have some trouble with the Three-way gang.
This is their district, isn't it?
Hey, I'm going for a drink with the guests.
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay, boss.
Okay.
Jong-soo, gimme some light.
Yes, boss.
You've come a long way smoking in front of me.
It's a special day, boss.
Let me smoke just this one.
So you like driving that BMW?
You know it's not my car.
Son of a bitch
Stop going around kissing boss's ass and act right.
What?
I heard you've been making trouble at Three-way's game room.
Are you going to fight them alone if they gain up on us?
What are you scared about?
It needs to happen anyway.
Hey, this business is mine.
Don't you butt in.
Byung-doo!
Hey, Min-ho!
KIM Min-ho, you son of a bitch!
Hey, long time no see.
Yeah, it's been a while.
How long has it been, man?
I know.
It's been ages.
Hey, you still look the same.
You too, man.
I could spot you out in an instant.
Oh yeah?
So why is it so hard to see you?
I looked up everywhere to find you.
Oh yeah?
Detective WOO called this morning.
He says you're a filmmaker?
I'm working on something.
Man, it's so cool I have a friend who's a film director.
What about you Byung-doo?
How's work?
I'm running that place and doing this and that.
Heard you wanted to meet gangsters?
Yeah, I'm preparing a gangster movie.
I met some detectives,
Now I need to meet some gangsters.
I don't know if it'll help.
They're just like normal people.
Still...
I need to learn about their world.
Hey, are you still keeping in touch with elementary friends?
Sure, I see them once in a while at the reunion events.
Then have you seen KANG Hyun-joo?
Yeah, I saw her at the last gathering.
You remember her?
I remember my close friends.
So, how is she doing?
I heard she works at a book store.
Yeah, what...
Jong-soo?
Son of a bitch
Mother fucker!
Fucker!
Fucking motherfuckers.
Come in all of you!
- Young-piI!
- Yes, boss.
Call the Three-way fucks.
Yes, boss.
- Byung-doo!
- Yes, boss.
It's war.
Gather all the boys.
Yes, boss.
Young-piI...
where are you?
Stuck in traffic?
Shit!
We're nearly there so get here as soon as you can!
Shit, run them over!
Open the trunk!
Open the trunk!
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Shit
Son of a bitch!
Boss!
What was he thinking?
Big boss made things messy gutting that boy for nothing
Boss, isn't our whole family in deep shit if he dies?
Shut up!
Let's wait til the boss gets things settled
Big boss'd better not forget us, after everything we did this time.
Yeah, Sun-ok, what?
Why on earth would you join the demonstration?
You're ill.
You have any idea how dangerous they are?
You thought they'd build around our house if you protested?
What else could I do?
By the way, what happened to your face?
Were you in a fight again?
Never mind my face.
You and Byung-sik, both of you...
It's all my fault.
Don't use your fists anymore.
Wars are outdated now.
You have to use your brains, Not your sashimi knives.
Yes, boss.
So how did you settle it?
We paid some compensation and Young-piI is going in.
- Young-piI is?
- Yes, boss.
I asked him to do it for me.
So I let his boys take care of the game room.
Boss, what do you mean?
I had to do it.
It was the least I could do for him.
Boss...
Sir, attorney PARK wants to see you in the next room.
Attorney PARK's here?
Who told him I was here?
Oh, did I make a mistake?
What shall I tell him?
Tell him I'll be there.
This asshole is a stumbling block in my life.
Boss, just have a drink with him.
Go to boss's car and wait.
Boss, can I talk to you?
What is it?
How can you do this to me?
You need to understand.
Boss, did I ever disobey you?
What is it that Young-piI did that I didn't do for you?
I know.
Next time, OK?
Boss, please...
just this once.
Our family is about to get thrown out to the streets.
Please reconsider, boss.
Then you wanna go in instead of Young-piI?
- See you again.
- Yeah, see you next time.
Yes.
- Is boss's car ready?
- Yes, boss.
- Hey!
- Yes?
- What's this?
- Oh, he's with me.
Meet attorney PARK.
He's a gangster too then.
Hey, come over here.
Fucking gangsters...
Parasites of our society...
Loser like this should be all sucked up with a vacuum cleaner.
Why don't you leave the poor kid alone.
Hey, Myung-geun.
You're neither a civilian nor a gangster.
What are you?
A mutt?
Act straight.
Let's have a smoke.
Yes.
People need to age gracefully.
Attorneys aren't easy.
How old are you?
Twenty-nine, boss.
That's when Sang-chuI came.
He was quick back then.
He's come a long way...
or maybe went too far.
There's so much to do but it's hard to find someone who'll last.
You should find a good sponsor and start making real money.
You can't be a gangster forever.
Thanks for your advice, boss.
Byung-doo, you just need to know two things to be successful.
Who you need, and what he needs...
It seems Sang-chuI doesn't need anything anymore.
Thanks for driving.
Good night, boss.
Think of me as your big brother.
- Yeah.
- Go home now.
Good night.
Sorry for coming back, boss.
It's okay.
What is it?
Do you have a name card of that attorney?
This is serious stuff.
All our necks are on the line.
You don't have to join me.
I'll do it myself if you're not in.
How can you say such a thing.
We're both outsiders, starting out as club waiters..
When will we make our fortune living like this?
Do you think we can ever find another sponsor like this?
Jong-soo!
Yes, boss.
Trust me on this one.
Yes, boss.
I'm here because of you.
I'll go if you go.
Good.
Let's go for it.
See if you can find out anything.
Work quietly.
Mr. CHOl!
How are you?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I was waiting for you but you didn't come...
Right, we had an appointment.
Sorry I forgot.
It's not a problem.
But, can I talk to you for a minute?
Right now?
I can't.
I have a meeting.
How about tomorrow?
See you tomorrow.
Then, have you read my scenario?
Your scenario?
Why don't you look for something else?
What?
The story hasn't changed a bit since last time.
If it's a gangster movie, it needs something strong.
but this one...
the storyline's just bland.
Plus, there's no gangster in this gangster movie.
Look for something else.
I'll change it... one last time.
I'm doing real interviews with some gangsters right now.
I'll make it realistic this time.
You just wait, motherfuckers.
I'll make something huge.
Hey!
- You found this place.
- Yeah, it wasn't hard.
What's up with you these days?
I couldn't get a hold of you.
Are you busy these days?
Yeah, the business is busy.
I'm sorry about the other day.
Things just happen and shit...
Yeah, I saw what happened.
Man, what was that fight over?
You saw?
Just the usual territory fight.
Man, that was some action.
It's my first time seeing gangsters fight.
Did you get hurt or anything?
I'm fine.
So what is it that you had to see me so urgently?
Oh, that...
I'll tell you as we go.
Go where?
Where are we going?
You'll see once we get there.
Where are you taking me...
It was such a spectacle when the fat boy got smashed.
We couldn't go that way since then thanks to this son of a bitch.
That's right.
Byung-doo, you used to be so athletic.
Don't youguys remember?
Our class won that relay run because of him.
Yeah, that's right.
Man, it's so good to see you again.
I know.
Yeah, come out more often.
Yeah, okay.
Help Min-ho with his film too.
It's about time he made something.
Hey, stop.
Who knows?
When he becomes famous maybe he'll bring some gorgeous actresses with him.
As if I'll have time for you guys.
- You arrogant son of a bitch.
- Whatever!
Hey, Min-ho, I think I'd better go in now.
Why?
Stay a little longer.
Hyun-joo will come soon.
This prick finally showed up.
I guess he did.
It's a bet!
Hey guys, he's betting two hundred for whoever finishes the pie in twenty seconds.
Twenty seconds?
Anyone can do that!
Whoever eats it can take it.
You'd better keep your word.
- OK, Two hundred!
- You guys, join us.
Alright, bring on the pie.
- Byung-doo, try it.
- Hey, let's do it.
One, two, start!
Stop!
Who's finished it?
He ate all.
For real?
Open your mouth.
What the...
Byung-doo, take it.
Forget it.
Use it to pay for the drinks.
Hey, Hyun-joo!
Sorry, sorry.
Come sit over here.
Why are you so late?
Work ended late today.
You're always late.
- You'd better pay penalty.
- Okay, next stop's on me.
Hyun-joo.
You know how long Byung-doo waited for you?
Hey, Byung-doo.
Hey, it's been a long time.
It's so good to see you.
You still look the same.
Really?
What do you mean?
She's aged.
You wanna die?
So when are you going to get married, Hyun-joo?
Hey, ask me after you find me a man first.
Hey, you know how much Byung-doo missed you?
Really?
Hey, I never said that.
Why not?
I missed him too.
She runs away when I approach her
Looks away when I glance at her
Time keeps passing by while
I wonder if she knows how I feel
She swifts by me, and though I try to ignore it
Aren't you glad you came today?
Let's see each other more often.
You know how much I missed you?
Min-ho, today's just perfect.
Yeah...
I may not run like a child I may not chase the butterfly but I'll stay by you forever
And flow by you like the river
I could run, I could fly.
If you came into my heart.
Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You rock.
- Hyun-joo!
Fighting!
- Fighting!
I could run, I could fly.
If you came into my heart.
Drive safely, I'll call again.
Not too close.
Run in.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Hey, what the hell is wrong with your driving?
I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off.
Don't you know any better not to drive when you're sleepy?
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the damage.
- Let me get your name card.
- Yes, sure.
Aren't you attorney PARK?
You know me?
Yeah, I'm OH Jong-soo.
Don't you remember me?
OH Jong-soo?
Have we met before?
I saw you at the Rainbow.
Why don't you eat some food as well.
The food here is really good.
Yes, boss.
You look healthier than before.
Really?
I'm working out more, running two extra kilometers.
I must live long enough to spend all that money I have.
Of course, boss.
How's getting ready for moving to the new place?
It's going well, thanks to you.
I got your back from now on so let's work as team.
I have this business plan that I might need your help in.
I'm at your service, boss.
I willing to work hard.
But you know it wont' be easy settling things with Sang-chuI.
I know, boss.
Good.
This case worked out well thanks to you.
- Let's drink to it.
- Yes, boss.
And, one more thing...
This never happened.
Not a soul will find out.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I know, boss.
- So it's ten in total?
- Yeah.
Let's see what you have.
Flush.
Hold your horses.
A full house.
Hey, good timing.
Go get some money.
What is it?
They were meeting together.
The fucking son of a bitch.
He dares to leave me out?
I think Byung-doo did attorney PARK as you said.
I'm sorry it's been so long.
How's your health?
It's just so-so.
I need to cope with it.
Still, you'll get better soon.
Mom, remember how he used to be so considerate.
I told him not to come, but he kept on insisting that he wanted to see you.
Really?
thank you.
I heard you've become a filmmaker?
Yes.
I'm so happy for you.
Poor Byung-doo couldn't finish school because of me.
Mom, you don't need to say that here.
Yeah.
Byung-doo's far better off than I am.
You've got yourself a good son.
You'd better tell some good stories to our director here.
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.
Tell him everything.
Ask them anything you want to know.
Okay.
If you wantjuicy stuff, ask him.
He's had it rough.
He can stab you while smiling.
Jong-soo boss cried last night watching a TV drama.
You fucking ass, shut up!
Hey, watch it.
We have a guest here.
Sorry boss.
Sorry boss.
Oh, it's ok.
Jong-soo, what is that tattoo of?
It's interesting.
It's a forget-me-not.
Boss waters it sometimes like this
Boss, my tattoo is prettier.
Hong-man's been watching over big boss's gang and says
Young-piI went down to Young-gwang today.
To Young-gwang?
Yeah, he didn't meet anyone in particular.
Just looked around.
Something's fishy.
When's Young-piI going in?
I heard after the big boss's sister's wedding.
Myung-goo, what do you want to do when you climb up in rank.
I want to find a good sponsor and make a fortune.
I wish to buy my own apartment someday.
Myung-goo and Hong-man are petite.
What made you wanna be a gangster?
Why boss, size doen't matter.
The days of fattening up eating dog food and shit are over.
These days, you can't survive like that.
You need brains and skills these days.
Gangsters need to study to read documents.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, how may I help you?
Byung-doo!
Wow that's a lot of books there.
You read all of it?
Just the titles.
Hey, what happened last time?
You left in the middle of it.
Oh, something came up.
Hey, so how long have you been working here?
- Seven to eight years.
- Oh really?
Your legs must hurt from standing all day.
Well... that's how it is.
So, how's your mother?
She's doing well.
I remember she used to cook red bean noodles for me.
I crave it sometimes.
Wow, you have good memory.
Come over whenever you crave it.
Hey, so you're not dating anyone?
Nope.
And you?
Me?
I was too busy thinking of you.
Yeah right.
I'm serious.
Anyway, it's really nice to see you again.
I know.
Hey, I heard about what you do for living.
What did you hear?
That I'm a gangster?
- Yeah, Young-piI.
- Boss said you get back.
- What?
- He wants to meet you.
- Right now?
- Yesh, boss!
- Alright.
- Hurry up.
You know what?
I need to get back to work.
Yeah.
Hey, is it okay if I came by once in a while?
No, why don't you call me when you're around here.
Why?
I don't want my friends to see me at work.
Alright.
- OK, bye.
- Bye.
Come on in.
You asked for me, boss?
Yeah.
Here's the wedding invitation.
Wow, congratulations.
Thanks.
Sit down.
It's sad sending her off.
So have you heard?
Heard what?
Attorney PARK's missing.
Who?
Attorney PARK!
You met him in front of that karaoke.
Cops came by because of that.
Don't know why they're linking me with his absence.
What gangster in his sane mind would do that?
Knowing it would kill the whole organization.
Don't you agree?
Of course, boss.
By the way, go to Young-gwang this weekend after the wedding.
Young-gwang?
Yeah, you remember Mr. JANG?
Go collect money from him.
Yes, boss.
Since that game room didn't work out for you, you can use half of it.
It'll be enough for you and your boys too.
Thanks, boss.
I kind of let you guys drift alone, didn't I?
It's hard with all these boys looking up to me.
I miss those days when we used to rought it together.
Yes, boss.
I want you to tell me if you feel like you're being mistreated.
You're the only one I have left, with Young-piI's going in soon.
He's done attorney PARK
Yeah.
Then you should finish him off and teach Mr. HWANG a lesson.
I don't want to shed blood before the wedding.
He's going after the wedding so go after him and work quietly.
Yes, boss.
This is melting in my mouth.
Boss, you should try some.
- Yeah, you go ahead eat.
- Okay.
This is for you guys.
Where is this from?
Get yourselves a new suit.
Thank you boss!
Let me ask you something.
What is a family?
What does a family mean to you?
Um, a family is like this, like us, boss.
A family is a mouth that eats from the same table.
One mouth, two.. three, four five, six... seven, including myself.
We are all one mouth.
- Understood?
- Yes, boss.
Then, what about the asshole that wants to eat alone?
He's not a part of the family.
He's a fucking stranger.
Am I right?
Yes, boss!
Echo waves reach everyone.
A land that split our youth
Life is a turning water mill, so follow the wind and the cloud.
I think the boss knows
Then we should hurry, boss.
It has to be done anyway.
We could get fucked before them if we wait too long
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Boss, nice to see you.
- How are you, boss?
- Ah, welcome.
Congratulations, boss.
Welcome.
Thanks
They said it might rain, but I'm glad it isn't, boss.
Yeah, I know.
You must be missing her already, boss.
Nay, It's about time she got married.
Good!
Everyone, look over here.
One, two!
Thank you.
Pay attention, please.
Would the friends of the groom and the bride come out to take a picture at the front of the aisle.
How's the food?
Thanks for coming.
You did a greatjob.
Boss.
Yeah.
The car is ready.
Yeah, escort them to the airport
- and drive safely.
- Yes, boss.
Hey, Mr. NOH, come over here.
Man, it's so hard to see you around.
Yeah, long time no see.
Here, sit down.
I need to greet the guests first.
- Have a drink before you go.
- Man, I can't resist.
The groom looks smart.
I heard he's from a good family.
So he's a fair match for my sister.
Of course, boss...
Well, I'm heading off to the airport, so I'll join you when I get back.
It's the least I can do for my boss.
You son of a bitch...
alright.
Okay, see you later.
What the fuck!
Hey!
So how many years are you going in for?
Why don't you take all that money you're managing... and leave the country for a few years?
Boss, you wanna die here or leave?
Hey, you have a drink too.
Hold on.
Boss, it seems there are more guests than expected.
I know.
Hey, nice suit.
Thanks.
It's a special day.
Shouldn't you be getting married soon too?
Not anytime soon, boss.
So when shall I visit Mr. JANG?
Huh?
Oh yeah, go tomorrow.
Mr. JANG isn't going to be easy to collect money from.
That's why appointed you to do the job.
Isn't that yours?
Oh, yes.
I don't know what to do with that gang.
Don't worry boss, I'll handle it.
- Okay.
- Long time no see, boss.
Who are you?
I met you at the funeral last time.
I'm with the Rotary gang, boss.
Oh, you're under Sang-chuI.
How are you?
Doing great, boss.
Did you enjoy the food, boss?
Wedding food's always the same.
Then drink as much as you want.
We've prepared enough of it.
I guess Sang-chuI boss is doing pretty well.
So many families came.
Sang-chuI's always in good terms with everyone.
His boys are pretty smart too.
I heard someone's going in because of the game room.
Young-piI's supposed to go in.
When is he going in?
Right after the wedding, boss.
Is Sang-chuI treating your family well too?
Of course, boss.
I see.
Yeah.
Let's finish it.
- Are we set?
- Yup.
- Okay, let's go.
- Yup.
Byung-doo.
I'll go with the driver and start unpacking.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Sun-ok might get lost later so wait for her at the bus stop.
Okay.
Let's go, mom.
Wait a minute.
Let me finish cleaning up.
What are you doing?
You don't need to do that.
Of course I do.
One must clean after his place.
By the way, why are the cops coming for you these days?
Why are you being questioned?
What have you done?
I wish you'd stop living like that and start leading a normal life.
Can you stop.
And don't worry.
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'll find that book for you.
- Yeah.
- Could you come this way?
Here you are.
Would you want me to reserve the other book for you?
Yes, please.
We'll call you when it arrives.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
This is all I could find.
Thanks.
- Who's that?
Your boyfriend?
- No.
He's good looking.
He's not my boyfriend.
Thanks.
- Try this book.
- Okay.
So if I read this, it'll help us with our teamwork?
That's what the title implies.
Sounds nice.
I should buy more of it.
Hey, let's have dinner tonight.
Dinner?
You're buying?
Of course.
You'd better treat me to something delicious.
Miss KANG, what are you doing here?
Customers are waiting.
He's a customer too.
I'll be there soon.
Right now!
You're not eating any more?
I'm full.
I was going to treat you to something fancier.
Why noodles?
I just felt like it.
It's good.
By the way, what was that at the bookstore?
He was an ass.
Oh, don't mind him.
Hey, why did you buy so many books?
They're for my employees.
I have an office now.
What kind of office?
I'm starting a real estate business.
Really?
I heard you're helping Min-ho with his movie.
I'm not much of a help.
I just told him some stories of how we live.
Hyun-joo, do you remember?
Remember what?
How we won first place in the relay race at school?
Yeah, of course I remember.
We used to stay after school to practice.
It was a lot of fun.
We used to go to Min-ho's place for noodles afterwards.
Yeah, we did.
Byung-doo.
Don't get offended by what I'm about to say... but I still can't believe you're doing that for living.
What?
I can't picture you as a gangster knowing how you used to be.
Hyun-joo.
Gangster's just a label.
I'm not as bad as you think.
You'll find out as you see me more often.
I guess Hyun-joo thinks of you a lot, sending you this.
What kind of tree is this?
It doesn't have branches.
Oh, it's a Lucky Tree It rarely blossoms but if it does, something good's supposed to happen.
Hey, I hope it blossoms so you can make a fortune.
Hmm... a Lucky Tree.
Man, she's a woman of wit.
- Hey, Hippo.
- Yes, boss.
Take special care of that.
If you let it die, you die with it.
Yes, boss.
Hey, Byung-doo.
You must've landed a good sponsor.
No, some boss helped me out.
Oh yeah, that boss has a daughter who wants to be an actress.
Can you cast her for your movie?
Why not.
If it's your request, I'll meet her next time.
Do you need help?
You have something chique and comfortable at the same time?
What size does the lady wear?
Try to find one this length.
- I'm sorry?
- This length.
I'm just asking dinner together.
What's the matter?
In front of company?
Let's have a talk.
I said no.
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong with you, huh?
You can't do this to me.
You're not supposed to do this anymore.
Not do what?
Hyun-joo.
Let's start again.
I said I'll try harder.
Does your wife know you're still doing this?
Why are you mentioning her?
This is about us.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Give me my purse.
- Why are you avoiding me?
- Give it back to me.
You can't leave until we're done talking.
- Give it back.
- Let's talk this over.
Hyun-joo.
Hey man, she said she wants to go.
What?
Who is this?
I'm Hyun-joo's friend.
A friend?
So what?
Byung-doo, let's go.
Give me my purse.
Oh... so there was a reason...
All that was for him?
- Hey man.
- Hey man?
Can't you see I have something to discuss with Hyun-joo?
Discuss what?
She said no.
It's okay, let's go.
Hyun-joo.
Wait in my car.
- Go to my car.
- Hey!
What are you doing?
Give me the purse.
Give it to me!
You son of a bitch...
Hey, hold right there!
I said hold right there!
Fucking son of a bitch!
You motherfucker!
Shit!
Hyun-joo!
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- Let me go.
What did I do wrong?
Was it that bad what I did?
- What?
- You saw what happened.
He asked for it.
I'm sorry if it scared you.
But I'm not sorry for him.
Don't come to see me anymore.
What?
I don't like gangsters.
So don't come to see me.
What are you saying?
You scare me.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Hey, you can't sit there forever.
Go home now.
I said someone's coming.
Nobody's coming.
Shit, just wait and see.
Hey, Byung-doo, Byung-doo.
Man, you're so fucking heavy.
Why did you drink so much?
- Min-ho!
- What?
Shit!
Why is life so fucking hard?
What are you talking about?
Life sucks.
Hey, you really not gonna eat?
No.
I'm staying over tonight.
It's messy like your place so make yourself at home.
I remember when I used to deliver for your restaurant.
Your mom used to hate seeing you hanging out with me.
Really?
But look at us.
The owner's son and the delivery boy, both pathetic.
Man, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said such a thing.
No, it's okay.
It's true what you said.
Hey, did you find the picture we talked about last time?
The picture?
Yeah.
I was going to give it to you.
Isn't Hyun-joo really cute?
Hey, how are things going between you guys?
- Min-ho, do I scare you too?
- Huh?
Why?
Did someone say you're scary?
No.
I never regretted being a gangster but today,
I feel shitty.
You're really weird today.
Did something happen?
Just thought I shouldn't be doing things I was doing.
tried everything to make money... doing dirty work with sashimi knife.
Still, nothing changed about this shitty life.
I don't know what happened but you're not the only one.
I've been living like this for three years to make a movie.
Hey, did you really use a sashimi knife?
Why?
It sounds so unreal.
May because you're my friend.
When did you get that scar on your shoulder?
This?
You know... when I was fighting over that game room.
Oh... is that scar from a knife?
Yeah.
I wonder what it's like being stabbed.
Have you ever stabbed anyone?
I'm no different from the rest.
What does it feel like?
Stabbing?
Feels like shit.
You're not yourself when you do it.
Yeah.
I can't imagine it.
That's why you shouldn't look into their eyes...
If you do,
it will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Nobody will understand...
I can't get it out of my mind.
Hey, who did you stab?
What's wrong with you today?
This is the bird's eye view of the apartment complex.
The total sales profit will be around 451.8 billion won and the cost of land, construction, and selling...
All those will be replaced by beautiful apartments.
A shopping mall over there and a subway line there.
Imagine the scale of money selling 1,500 units.
We'll get at least five hundred if everything works out well.
Five hundred units?
I can't imagine it, boss.
It could be more.
But it won't be easy driving out the locals.
The landlords probably heard about the development by now.
They'll expect compensation.
There are some defrauders.
You think you can handle it?
Yes, I'll do it, boss.
Good.
If you help me dig those grounds,
I'll give you fifty units.
- Really, boss?
- Of course.
I'm here because of you.
I'll make sure it happens.
Your scenario was good.
Why didn't you do it sooner?
Pardon me?
What happened?
I guess all those interviews paid off.
The characters seemed real and the story's good.
Oh, really?
Let's do it.
- What?
- Let's get the actors together and start tomorrow.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Her beautiful mind mind caressed my heart
Lady, sell it.
Shit, you're holding up our construction business.
Should we come by at night and bury her?
Boss, let's do that.
I know a good mountain for digging.
Things will only get worse.
We'll pay you some extra.
How many times do I need to tell you.
I can't sell it.
I lived here for 30 years and it's all I've got for my sons.
So your second son is a senior in high school?
Excuse me?
Boss, we couldn't find the owners of the five houses.
They're probably hiding.
That 5 area,
I think the Serpents' got them.
I guess they want a part in this too.
The matter's serious if it's the Serpents though.
My boys will find those five landlords soon.
As long as we find one, the rest will come out easy.
Do it quietly.
An all-out war isn't easy.
Yes, boss.
Your guest has arrived.
- Hey, Min-ho.
Come here.
- Hello, director KIM.
Welcome.
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to ask you to come when you must be so busy.
It's no problem.
I heard a lot about you from Byung-doo.
He seems very proud of you.
Really?
How's it coming along?
We'll go into shooting soon.
- First of all, congratulations.
- Thank you.
And thanks for casting my daughter.
She's good for the role.
Plus, Byung-doo helped me so much, it's the least I could do.
It'd better be a big hit.
Thanks.
You can count on me, boss.
Make a blockbuster, Min-ho.
Fighting!
She runs away when I approach her
Looks away when I glance at her
Time keeps passing by while
I wonder if she knows how I feel
She swifts by me, and though I try to ignore it
She flows me like the river She's a rainbow over my heart
I could run, I could fly
If you come into my heart
May I help you?
Do you know where Ms. KANG Hyun-joo is?
She didn't come to work today.
I'm a friend of hers.
Could you give this to her for me?
She's sick, so she's taking some days off.
Really?
Hyun-joo!
Open the door.
I said open the door!
Come out!
Open the door.
You'd better open the door or I'm gonna break in.
Hyun-joo!
Is she okay?
The doctor will be here soon.
Why didn't you call home if you were this sick?
I must say this is excellent although I made it.
I used to get beat to get the recipe right for this.
Try it.
Try just a bite then, for my sake.
Why are you crying?
Eat so you can recover.
What the...
- I'm tired of waiting, Digger
- Digger
- Tired of waiting, Digger
- Digger
I'm so lonely tonight
This is expensive, you know.
100% natural honey...
Man, it's sweet!
It's sweet, ain't it?
There are lots of ants and digger bees in this mountain.
Won't it be nice to see happens for a few days?
Huh?
Where's are they?
Good afternoon, boss.
Did we get everything?
Things got complicated, boss.
Why?
I was just working on those five and it seems Serpent's got the papers himself.
What?
Serpent has them?
Fucking son of a bitch.
What shall we do, boss?
Kill them until they tell you where Serpent is.
Yes, boss.
Who are you?
Mr. KIM, it's not polite to mess with others'business.
Who the fuck are you?
Your mother seemed ill.
Who are you?
And isn't it danerous after dark for a pretty girl like your sister?
Byung-doo, what's wrong?
What's going on?
Sun-ok, hurry up and pack.
We're leaving right now.
- Mom says she's not going.
- What's happening?
I'll explain later.
Stay at uncle's place for a few days.
- Where's Byung-sik?
- He hasn't come home in a couple of days.
That son of a bitch.
Hurry, what are you doing?
I'm not leaving my house.
What did you do this time?
It's not what you think.
Just listen to me this once.
I can't deal with this anymore.
First it was cops, now we have to hide from gangsters?
We can manage on our own, go hide by yourself.
Your bad example messed up Byung-sik as well.
Shit!
You think I come here because I want to?
Who's gonna take care of Byung-sik and Sun-ok?
Stop shouting at mom.
I won't ask you to take care of us, so get out!
Okay, I'II leave, so do whatever you want.
Where are they, boss?
Call Jong-soo and tell him to send some boys over to my house.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.
We'll take care of them.
Yes, boss.
We'll bury them as soon as we find out where they are.
Okay, boss.
What did the boss say?
To finish everything tonight.
Okay.
Since they love land so much, we'll bury them.
We'll do what they did to our boys, when we find them.
Of course.
Can't believe we're going through all this trouble for Axe.
He shouldn't have got caught by them.
Boss, won't we get something for rescuing all of them?
I'm sure we will as soon as the boss gets things settled.
You know, Axe is a fucking psycho.
Remember when we went to collect money from
royal Billiards?
Axe forgot to undig him afterwards.
Fuck!
Lighter, lighter.
When we went back the tide water had already reached right below his eyes.
He could've died.
Isn't he a dumb ass, boss?
It gets even better.
When we got there, he looking up at me with these sad pleading eyes.
I was kind of hesitating to kill him.
Then all of a sudden a stream of water shot out of nowhere.
You know what it was?
Eui-jung was pissing on him.
Isn't that something?
He must've been pissing in his pants himself.
I'm sure he was, boss.
All those Mok-po bitches are in the past, boss.
You lying bitch...
What the...
Stop the car!
Fuck!
Fucking, where's Serpent?
Motherfucker!
Stay still, bitch.
Hurry, get him in the car.
This is Serpent's and these are the rest of the landlords'.
The land is open for construction now.
Good job.
You're ruthless.
What about the Serpents?
They're resolved for good?
Of course, boss.
After the authorization, we're set for good.
Don't forget about my share, boss.
Of course, you'll get your share.
- Cut!
- It's a cut.
Everybody, gather here.
What's up with yourjump?
It's very different from real life.
I know, boss.
- Hold on.
- Practice!
Everything nice and all, but actions seem too sophisticated
Can't we get it a bit more realistic?
Realistic?
How?
Maybe you can take out thatjumping round kick.
You said it was okay on the first round.
You should've said it earlier then.
Now we have to change the whole routine.
This just isn't the type of action I was thinking of...
OK then, no jumping round kick.
What else?
I don't know what you want so tell me specifically.
- Min-ho.
- Yeah.
He's the martial arts choreographer?
Yeah, why?
Hi, I was just watching.
I'm sorry to butt in, but the fight doesn't seem real.
Yes.
Min-ho.
real gangsters don't fight like this.
Yeah.
Hey, Jong-soo!
Come over here.
Yeah!
- Hurry up.
- Yes, boss.
Stand right here.
You see, a punch should always fly low.
Keep it low and give it a sting at the end.
Like this.
This is how you do it.
I'm fine but the crew seems to feel a bit uncomfortable.
I guess I made a mistake.
I was only trying to help.
I know, but they're all really sensitive right now with stress.
Yeah, then I'll head off.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you soon
When it's all over.
Yeah, good luck with the rest of the shooting.
Min-ho!
Make something with a real Gangster spirit.
See you.
See you.
You're off early today.
Hey, it's been a while.
Yeah, how were you?
You feel better now?
Yeah, I'm much better now.
Good.
Hey, you don't seem happy to see me.
Here, people are watching, hurry, take it.
Actually, I went the book shop several times to see you.
But I couldn't say hi to you.
Thought you'd feel uncomfortable.
But I'm glad you look better.
Oh yeah, thank you for the other day.
You're a good cook.
Yeah, then get sick again.
so I can cook for you again.
How do you like this place?
It's really nice to be out after working inside all day.
It's like another world, another life in there.
I'll take you to a better place next time.
I saw you wearing new shoes.
Does it fit?
How did you know my size?
Just an eye measurement.
I'm always receiving things from you.
What is it?
What's the event?
Nothing.
I just wanted to celebrate something.
Enjoy your cake.
What did you want to celebrate?
You Remember you sent me a Lucky tree?
It blossomed today.
Really?
That's really rare.
Yeah I know, but it did.
If something good really happens, it's because of you.
I had fun today.
Getting some fresh air...
You're a good conversationist, and smiled a lot too today.
You helped me.
I haven't had such a good time in a while.
Really?
Yeah.
Next time, I'm buying.
OK!
cool.
Won't you invite me for a cup of coffee?
Coffee?
It's too late tonight.
I'll make it for you next time.
Okay.
Man, I can't believe it's time to go already.
Drive safely.
And thanks for the flowers.
Yup.
Hyun-joo, hold on.
Hyun-joo, can I like you?
You still hate me?
No, it's just...
I'm not sure...
Hyun-joo, if you want,
I can quit being a gangster.
To tell you the truth, I've never liked anyone but you.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
The south ganster's struggle
- Congratulations.
Seems like a hit.
- Hey, thanks.
Min-ho.
- You're here.
- You did a greatjob
Everybody's talking about how good the movie it.
It's good.
It's a good piece of work.
Really?
You must work with me next time then.
Thank you.
- Director!
- Hey, Ji-ae
- Hello, Director.
Hi.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for coming.
Did Ji-ae cause you trouble?
No, she was great.
It was tough for her too.
Director, I think it's a hit.
Everyone's talking about it.
Yeah.
- I wish you best of luck.
- Yes, thank you.
By the way, didn't you invite Byung-doo?
Oh, yes.
I tried calling him, but he wouldn't pick up.
Right, he's so busy these days with work.
I see.
I'll see you after the movie.
Let's have a drink sometime.
Sure.
Have more.
I hope you like it.
It tastes exactly like when I had it in elementary.
I'm glad.
Take some home with you.
She's made plenty.
It's not worth taking home.
Hyun-joo, come over often.
Okay.
A tip for my sister-in-law, it tastes better with salt and suger.
Hey, you're embarrassing her.
It's my wishful thinking.
Byung-doo, you'd like that too.
You've become a different person ever since you've been dating her.
No I haven't.
Your brother always talks about how pretty and smart you are.
Really?
I'm so happy you're with him.
He has a good heart.
Always bringing all sorts of medicine.
You need to get well soon.
Yes, boss.
Where are you?
I'm having dinner with my family.
- So oblivious...
- Pardon?
Are you alright?
What kind of driving is that?
I'm sorry, I had a small drink...
I'm sorry.
What?
You're driving drunk?
Let me see your license.
I don't have one.
Then let me see your ID.
I don't have that either.
No ID?
What kind of person would drive without a license?
You know who I am?
I sure do.
Hello, attorney Choi!
Long time no see.
Who did you do it to?
Go ahead and tell me.
Min-ho.
I took my boss.
Why?
There must've been a reason for taking him.
You wouldn't do that to your boss for no reason.
You can't tell anyone about this...
How far does he know?
I didn't mention anything about you.
Trust me, boss.
Are you out of your mind?
How could you tell him?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
Why did Sang-chuI end up that way?
What will happen if your friend went about telling everyone?
He won't do such a thing, boss.
How can you be sure?
You did it, you clean it up.
Look over here, good.
You're doing well.
Okay, once more.
Now, hold your fists, pose like a gangster.
Smile a little more, a little more, good!
Your characters are very real.
Did you interview real gangsters?
Not, especially.
I watched a lot of gangster movies like THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE.
I usually get inspiration from that movies.
I'm sorry, I should've called you.
Why did you do that?
I trusted you when I told you that.
You shouldn't have done it if you considered me your friend.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, but...
Sorry?
What if this ruins me?
You don't give a fuck, do you?
- Hey, listen to me.
- Listen to what?
I thought hard about it and I figured it would be harmless.
Everyone knows about the case and anyone could've done it.
You've watched it too.
It's not about you.
I made it up.
Think about it.
Kim Min-Ho.
Okay, let's say it was my mistake.
But gangsters can do anything to cover their mistakes.
You wondered what it'd be like being stabbed.
Let me say just one thing... shut up for the rest of your life.
Okay?
Can you do that?
Yes.
I'll take it to my grave.
If something happens, I'm not going down alone, got it?
You trust him?
I don't.
He even made it into a movie.
I said I got it under control.
Stop talking about it.
And start gathering boys for the model house.
If you can't do it because he's your friend, I'll do it.
What?
Leave it up to me.
You son of a bitch, you stay out of this.
What do you mean, Stay out of it, boss?
It's my business so you can stay out of it!
Boss, this isn't just about you.
Our whole family's on the line.
Why are you covering for that fucking bastard?
Will you take care of us, if we all get fucked up?
You son of of a bitch!
Son of bitch!
I'll fucking shut you up.
Didn't I say I got it under control, huh?
Don't you ever mention that in front of me again.
Long time no see, boss.
Stop.
Yeah.
Boss, how could you?
Unlike our boss,
I don't know you very well,
Ain't that so you pussy.
Sorry to worry you, boss.
I got everything under control now.
Don't make another mistake.
Yes, boss.
model house and sales start next week, so be prepared.
Yes, boss.
Our boss saved you this time.
But we'll be watching you.
Better keep your mouth shut.
We're on the same boat now.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your help.
- It's doing well.
- Yes, I'm glad.
What was the competition rate for sales contract until yesterday?
It was 50 to 1 until this morning.
- Boss!
- I knew it would do well.
You did?
Thank you.
We brought more boys.
Really?
Set them over there to lift the atmosphere.
- Okay.
- Okay, boss.
Okay!
Mr. HWANG, the competition is now 70 to 1.
The banks are panicking.
They running out of applications.
Good, keep checking!
Yeah.
Congratulations, boss.
It's a huge success.
You did a lot of work.
Prepare a big feast for the employees tonight.
Let's go in.
Digger!
Hey, Myung-goo!
What is a family?
It's a mouth that eats from the same table.
That's right.
Our family will go all the way!
I can't trust you.
I can't!
I can't!
- You must grow up.
- You must!
You must!
It's no use explaining, but, your heart is good.
Today it's chrysanthemum
Tomorrow it's rose.
You'll fall asleep tired from flirting!
Everybody!
I'm tired of waiting, Digger!
I'm tired of waiting, Digger!
I'm so lonely tonight
Lonely, so lonely
You're a digger, I can't help it
You're a digger, I have to cry.
I'm so lonely tonight.
Lonely, so lonely
I enjoyed your movie.
I was so realistic.
So, why did you call me?
Is something troubling you?
Your little help will be courage poor people.
Let's help poor people.
Let's give them love the end of the year.
Your little help will be courage poor people.
Hey!
Can you come with me?
What is it?
What's the good news?
Tell me.
Not here, come with me.
I'm busy right now.
How about after work?
I can't wait that long.
What is it?
Tell me!
I wanted to say it in a better setting.
Take this first.
What is it?
Open it
- KIM Byung-doo!
- Stay right there!
Move!
Do not let him go!
Catch him!
Move!
Stop!
- Stop!
- Move!
That son of bitch!
Freeze!
Boss, sorry to come by like this.
Jong-gyu, step outside for a while.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry boss.
So what is your plan?
You're gonna hide forever?
I'll clean up the mess since I caused it.
I'll take Min-ho.
What?
I'll finish him and I'II leave the country too.
He's big now.
Things can get more complicated.
I can do it, boss.
Just make sure you give me my share.
It's all my family can depend on.
Just in case, things go wrong, I won't mention your name.
The movie broke the record and sold five million tickets.
Thank you again.
Now let me introduce director KIM Min-ho.
Hello, I'm KIM Min-ho, the director of the movie.
I'm happy to meet all of you.
Thank you for watching our movie.
There were some difficult moments in making this movie, but I never dreamed a day like this would come.
- Yeah, Jong-soo.
- Boss, I just arrived here.
I'll be right there.
Wow, it was crazy going into that theater.
I'm glad we hired those bodyguards.
Thanks, detective!
Why do you look so down?
You should cheer up on a day like this.
Let's have a drink.
Come on, director!
- Let's drink!
- I don't want to ruin this, but I should leave now.
- You can't leave!
- No you can't, director!
What are you talking about?
We're going clubbing after this.
Come on!
I feel ashamed...
Leting you guys down...
I should've listened to you.
That was my biggest mistake.
What good is it to regret the past, boss?
We just need to try solving it.
After this, while I'm gone, you guys live quietly for two years.
And be a good boss to the boys while I'm gone.
Okay, boss.
Boss!
How are you?
Good, what's going on?
They're about to go somewhere else.
Okay.
I'll go ahead, you wait outside.
Be careful, boss.

You must be tired.
You must be more tired than me, detective.
I'm used to this, it's my job.
Detective, why don't you have a drink with us too?
Oh no, I'm fine.
I met him when I went to the station.
He's been a lot of help.
Hold on.

Don't worry too much.
He'll come back soon.
Yeah.
Okay, take care.
Bye.
You go ahead drink first.
Yes, sir.
So what is your next movie going to be about?
I haven't decided yet.
How about my past love story?
Excuse me?
You see, I've had a hell of a drama in my love life.
Oh, I see...
Let's meet often to talk about it.
If you like the story, you don't need to worry about the money.
Since you're good at making up stories, I think you'll do it well.
Oh, no... no.

But don't make it too similar, my wife might kill me.
Yup, a fiction will always be a fiction.
Your guest has arrived.
How are you, boss?

Yes, boss.
I know him well.
Since you won't be in seoul for a while, drink up and enjoy.
Thank you, boss.
And congratulations for winning the award.
Yes.
Lets forget the past and start fresh.
Cheers!
This is one of my favorite songs.

You fucking bastard.
You're a gangster?
You wanna be a gangster, too?
Let go.
Fucking bastard!
Beays up a person and throws away money.
I have to admit he's good for nothing though he's my son.
He needs years behind bars before he comes to his senses.
Stop it already.
We should be thankful they accepted our offer.
By the way, what shall we do?
We only have a month to move out.
Where can we get that much money?
Produced by TCHA Sung-jai KIM Mi-hee / CHOI Sun-joong
I'll find a way.
No, it's okay.
I'll get the money somehow this time.
I'll get the money.
Don't worry, mom.
You wanna get sick again?
This is for Sun-ok's academy and your medication.
Do you still have chest pains?
They're tolerable.
You'd better not be seen with those scamps again.
Next time, I'm gonna break your legs.
- See you.
- Okay.
Drive safely and come by more often.
I think mom's condition's gotten worse these days.
OK.
Here.
A cell phone?
It's not for you to chat and text message with your friends
I can keep it?
Call mom whenever you're late from the academy.
- OK

Oh, KIM Byung-doo?
I know him well.
Really?
How do you know him?
I was in charge ofthe Rotary gang.
I met him then.
How do you know him?
He's my friend from elementary.
Oh, he's your friend?
Yeah.
I've been asking every policeman I met to find him
You should see him then, rather than talking to me
If it's for your movie, you should talk to the gangster himself.
I guess so.
You motherfuckers!
You think you can leave whenever you want?
You think this is some kind a club?
A fucking picnic?
Straighthen up.
I'm home, boss.
Why did you bring them back ifthey didn't wanna be here anymore?
- Jong-soo.
- Yes, boss.
From now on, cut their fingers before they leave.
Yes, boss.
- You, youngest!
- Yes, boss.
- It's tough isn't it?
- No, it's ok, boss.
Let's bear it a little longer.
Since we're already here, might as well go all the way.
- Hey, Hippo!
- Yes, boss.
What's our philosophy?
Yes, boss.
Never lose face, never getjumped on,
Get your shoes polished even if you skip a meal.
Though we may starve to death, we should never fail to respect ourselves
So what do you become the minute you lose integrity?
A scamp.
- Am I right?
- Right, boss.
Let's try our best.
- Let's go working!
- Yes, boss.
Apartment number 108-503!
Bitch, gimme my money!
CHOI Sun-duk, Pay back if you borrowed my money!
Residenys of building 108!
My family's starving because apt. 503 won't pay me back!
Who are you calling a bitch!
Honey, call the police!
Go ahead, call again.
Let's go by the fucking law.
You're going a bit too far, young man.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't have any money!
Hello?
Sun-ok?
Byung-doo?
Can you hear me?
Yup.
Got good connection.
What's up?
I forgot to say thank you for the cell phone.
Hey, go back your studying and don't waste your time calling me.
The fruit of patience is what?
It's sweet.
Gotta go, I'm working.
Damn, what are you doing?
Do it harder, make me hard.
Higher, higher.
That's right.
That's right, there.
- Get back to your room.
- Right there.
Good.
I was hurting right there.
♪ Today it's chrysanthemum tomorrow it's rose
♪ You'll fall asleep tired from flirting
♪ I'm tired of waiting Digger Digger
♪ Tired of collecting money Digger Digger
♪ I'm so lonely tonight
Who are you under?
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
I'm so fucking busy getting ready for my business.
How could I fucking interrupt yours?
What?
Yeah, go ahead!
We're gonna open as planned.
Do whatever you want!
Bring your axe and shit!
Shit!
- Hey!
- Yes, boss.
Hey, why did you make it so noticeable?
Sorry, boss.
I tried my best.
We might as well clean them up for good this time, boss!
Leave it.
Don't make things big.
Take care of it at your level.
Yes, boss.
Later, boss.
Boss, is everything okay?
Yeah, the game room...
- So you got it?
- Yes, boss.
Good.
Here, this is for you.
Boss, give us a bit more.
Hey, times are difficult for me too.
Getting my only sister married cosys a shit load.
A bit more, boss.
We can't even pay rent these days.
Dumb ass!
Getting cheated by your own sponsor...
Let's wait 'til things get better.
You said that before, boss.
What!
Boss, can't you just pretend you skipped a racecourse bet?
You fucking with me?
How dare you fuck with me...
Byung-doo, how old are you this year?
Twenty-nine, boss.
Twenty-nine, huh?
And look at yourself.
Still begging for money...
Shouldn't you be getting somewhere by now?
Six villas and 20% a month.
Get them notarized...
Why waste money?
We are the notary.
Then make sure you get all the right documenys.
Right, boss.
How are you, boss!
Yes, Byung-doo!
Heard you did a greatjob.
It's nothing.
No, no, that wasn't easy money to get back.
Sang-chul's got a smart kid under him.
All my boys are smart, boss.
Byung-doo, we're about to go for a drink.
Join us.
- Don't mind me.
- Come along.
You can be boss's designated driver.
I like you cause you don't look like a gangster.
Gangsters need to look like this nowadays.
It's hard to do business looking like him.
Boss, I've been getting facials.
Byung-doo, got a sponsor?
No, boss.
Not anymore.
Things didn't work out, boss.
His sponsor flew with our investment money.
It's hell of a situation, boss.
Then why don't you let him manage the new game room?
Yes, boss.
I was thinking about that.
I love you, boss.
♪ Oh my god oh my god don't do this to me
♪ A girl's heart is like a reed
♪ Don't do this Don't ask
♪ Don't ask any more
Hello.
Yes, I'm having a drink with some employees.
Uh?
I'm afraid I can't right now.
Yes, I know.
Yes, give me some more time.
I'm sorry.
♪ I can't believe I love you
♪ Though you're not...
Fucking asshole!
What a pain in the ass.
But try to work things out.
- Sang-chul.
- Yes, boss.
Why don't you take attorney PARK for me?
What?
Couldn't you quietly solve this situation?
What do you mean?
I can't sleep well knowing he's pulling my strings.
If you do it for me, got your back for the rest of your life.
Can you do it?
Boss, we'll all get fucked.
You know that boss.
I'll do anything, but an attorney...
It's a different matter.
Right.
I knew it'd be hard.
Glory Game Land
Boss.
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks for coming.
You're raking in money.
Rake in my ass.
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.
Heard you're gonna be in charge ofthis place.
- Yes.
-Good luck, boy.
It's a good location, all it needs is a good management.
This is just the beginning.
Soon, we'll own several ofthese.
We need to get a good sponsor and start making a fortune.
By the way boss, we're gonna have some trouble with the Three-way gang.
This is their district, isn't it?
Hey, I'm going for a drink with the guesys.
I'll be back soon.
- Okay, boss.
- Ok.
- Jong-soo, gimme some light.
- Yes, boss.
You've come a long way smoking in front of me.
It's a special day, boss.
Let me smoke just this one.
So you like driving that BMW?
You know it's not my car.
Son of a bitch!
Stop going around kissing boss's ass and act right.
What?
I heard you've been making trouble at Three-way's game room.
Are you going to fight them alone ifthey gain up on us?
What are you scared about?
It needs to happen anyway.
Hey, this business is mine.
Don't you butt in.
Byung-doo!
Hey, Min-ho!
KIM Min-ho!
Hey, long time no see.
Yeah, it's been a while.
How long has it been, man?
I know.
It's been ages.
Hey, you still look the same.
You too, man.
I could spot you out in an instant.
Oh yeah?
So why is it so hard to see you?
I looked up everywhere to find you.
Oh yeah?
Detective WOO called this morning.
He says you're a filmmaker?
I'm working on something.
Man, it's so cool I have a friend who's a film director.
What about you Byung-doo?
How's work?
I'm running that place and doing this and that.
Heard you wanted to meet gangsters?
Yeah, I'm preparing a gangster movie.
I met some detectives
Now I need to meet some gangsters.
I don't know if it'll help.
They're just like normal people.
Still...
I need to learn about their world.
Hey, are you still keeping in touch with elementary friends?
Sure, I see them once in a while at the reunion evenys.
Then have you seen KANG Hyun-joo?
KANG Hyun-joo?
Yeah, I saw her at the last gathering.
You remember her?
I remember my close friends.
So, how is she doing?
I heard she works at a book store.
Yeah, Jong-soo.
what?
Son of a bitch!
You motherfucker.
Son of a bitch!
Fucking motherfuckers.
Come in all of you!
- Young-pil!
- Yes, boss.
- Call the Three-way fucks.
- Yes, boss.
- Byung-doo!
- Yes, boss.
It's war.
Gather all the boys.
Yes, boss.
Young-pil...
where are you?
What?
Stuck in traffic?
We're nearly there so get here as soon as you can!
Shit, run them over!
Motherfuckers.
Open the trunk!
Shit
Son of a bitch.
Die!
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Motherfuckers!
Boss!
What was he thinking?
Big boss made things messy gutting that boy for nothing
Boss, isn't our whole family in deep shit if he dies?
Shut up!
Let's wait 'til the boss geys things settled
Big boss'd better not forget us, after everything we did this time.
Yeah, Sun-ok.
What?
!
Why on earth would you join the demonstration?
You have any idea how dangerous they are?
You thought they'd build around our house if you protested?
What else could I do?
By the way, what happened to your face?
Were you in a fight again?
Never mind my face.
You and Byung-sik, both of you...
It's all my fault.
Don't use your fisys anymore.
Wars are outdated now.
You have to use your brains, Not your sashimi knives.
Yes, boss.
So how did you settle it?
We paid some compensation and Young-pil is going in.
- Young-pil is?
- Yes, boss.
I asked him to do it for me.
So I let his boys take care ofthe game room.
Boss, what do you mean?
I had to do it.
It was the least I could do for him.
Boss...
Sir, attorney PARK wanys to see you in the next room.
Attorney PARK's here?
Who told him I was here?
Did I make a mistake?
What shall I tell him?
Tell him I'll be there.
This asshole is a stumbling block in my life.
Boss, just have a drink with him.
Go to boss's car and wait.
Boss, can I talk to you?
What is it?
How can you do this to me?
You need to understand.
Boss, did I ever disobey you?
What is it that Young-pil did that I didn't do for you?
I know.
Next time, OK?
Boss, please just this once.
Our family is about to get thrown out to the streeys.
Please reconsider, boss.
Then you wanna go in instead ofYoung-pil?
- See you again.
- Yeah, see you next time.
- Is boss's car ready?
- Yes, boss.
- Hey!
- Yes?
- That's this?
- Oh, he's with me.
Meet attorney PARK.
He's a gangster too then.
Hey, come over here.
Fucking gangsters...
Parasites of our society...
Loser like this should be all sucked up with a vacuum cleaner.
Why don't you leave the poor kid alone.
Hey, Myung-geun.
You're neither a civilian nor a gangster.
What are you?
A mutt?
Act straight.
Let's have a smoke.
People need to age gracefully.
Attorneys aren't easy.
How old are you?
Twenty-nine, boss.
That's when Sang-chul came.
He was quick back then.
He's come a long way...
or maybe went too far.
There's so much to do but it's hard to find someone who'll last.
You should find a good sponsor and start making real money.
You can't be a gangster forever.
Thanks for your advice, boss.
Byung-doo, you just need to know two things to be successful.
Who you need, and what he needs...
It seems Sang-chul doesn't need anything anymore.
Thanks for driving.
Good night, boss.
Think of me as your big brother.
Yes.
Go home now.
Good night.
Sorry for coming back, boss.
It's okay.
What is it?
Do you have... a name card ofthat attorney?
This is serious stuff.
All our necks are on the line.
You don't have to join me.
I'll do it myself if you're not in.
How can you say such a thing.
We're both ouysiders, starting out as club waiters...
When will we make our fortune living like this?
Do you think we can ever find another sponsor like this?
Jong-soo!
Yes, boss.
Trust me on this one.
Yes, boss.
I'm here because of you.
I'll go if you go.
Good.
Let's go for it.
See if you can find out anything.
Work quietly.
Mr. CHOI!
How are you?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I was waiting for you but you didn't come...
Right, we had an appointment.
Sorry, I forgot.
It's not a problem.
But, can I talk to you for a minute?
Right now?
I can't.
I have a meeting.
How about tomorrow?
See you tomorrow.
Then, have you read my scenario?
Your scenario?
Why don't you look for something else?
The story hasn't changed a bit since last time.
If it's a gangster movie, it needs something strong.
but this one...
the storyline's just bland.
Plus, there's no gangster in this gangster movie.
Look for something else.
Sir.
I'll change it...
one last time.
I'm doing real interviews with some gangsters right now.
I'll make it realistic this time.
You just wait, motherfuckers.
I'll make something huge.
Hey, you found this place.
Yeah, it wasn't hard.
What's up with you these days?
I couldn't get a hold of you...
Are you busy these days?
Yeah, the business is busy.
I'm sorry about the other day.
Things just happen and shit...
Yeah, I saw what happened.
Man, what was that fight over?
You saw?
Just the usual territory fight.
Ah!
Man, that was some action.
It's my first time seeing gangsters fight.
Did you get hurt or anything?
I'm fine.
So what is it that you had to see me so urgently
Oh, that...
I'll tell you as we go.
Go where?
Where are we going?
You'll see once we get there.
Where are you taking me...
It was such a spectacle when the fat boy got smashed.
We couldn't go that way since then thanks to this son of a bitch.
That's right.
Byung-doo, you used to be so athletic.
Don't you remember?
Our class won that relay run because of him.
Yeah, that's right.
Man, it's so good to see you again.
I know.
Yeah, come out more often.
Yeah, okay.
Help Min-ho with his film too.
It's about time he made something.
Hey, stop.
Who knows?
When he becomes famous maybe he'll bring some gorgeous actresses with him.
As if I'll have time for you guys.
You arrogant son of a bitch.
Whatever!
Hey, Min-ho,
I think I'd better go in now.
Why?
Stay a little longer.
Hyun-joo will come soon.
This prick bought it.
I guess he did.
It's a bet!
He's betting two hundred for whoever finished
- the pie in 20 seconds.
- Really?
20 seconds?
Anyone can do that!
Whoever eays it can take it.
You'd better keep your word.
- OK, Two hundred!
- You guys, join us.
Alright, bring on the pie.
- Byung-doo, try it.
- Hey, let's do it.
One, two, start!
Stop!
Who's finished it?
For real?
Open your mouth.
What the...
Byung-doo, take it.
Use it to pay for the drinks.
Hey, Hyun-joo!
Sorry, sorry.
Come sit over here.
Why are you so late?
Work ended late today.
You're always late.
- You'd better pay penalty.
- Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You know how long Byung-doo waited for you?
Hey, Byung-doo.
Hey, it's been a long time.
It's so good to see you.
You still look the same.
Really?
What do you mean?
She's aged.
You wanna die?
So when are you going to get married, Hyun-joo?
Hey, ask me after you find me a man first.
Hey, you know how much Byung-doo missed you?
Really?
Hey, I never said that.
Why not?
I missed him too.
♪ She runs away when I approach her
♪ Looks away when I glance at her
♪ Time keeps passing by while
♪ I wonder if she knows how I feel
♪ She swifts by me
♪ and though I try to ignore it
Aren't you glad you came today?
Let's see each other more often.
You know how much I missed you?
Min-ho, today's just perfect.
Yeah... ♪ I may not chase the butterfly
♪ but I'll stay by you forever
♪ And flow by you like the river
♪ I could run I could fly
♪ If you came into my heart
Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You rock.
♪ I could run I could fly
Drive safely, I'll call again.
Not too close.
Run in.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Hey, what the hell is wrong with your driving?
I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off.
Don't you know any better not to drive when you're sleepy?
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the damage.
- Let me get your name card.
- Yes, sure.
Aren't you attorney PARK?
You know me?
Yeah, I'm OH Jong-soo.
Don't you remember me?
OH Jong-soo?
Have we met before?
I saw you at the Rainbow.
Why don't you eat some food as well.
The food here is really good.
Yes, boss.
You look healthier than before.
Really?
I'm working out more, running two extra kilometers.
I must live long enough to spend all that money I have.
Of course, boss.
How's getting ready for moving to the new place?
It's going well, thanks to you.
I got your back from now on so let's work as team.
I have this business plan that I might need your help in.
I'm at your service, boss.
I willing to work hard.
But you know... it wont' be easy settling things with Sang-chul.
I know, boss.
Good.
This case worked out well thanks to you.
- Let's drink to it.
- Yes, boss.
And, one more thing...
This never happened.
Not a soul will find out.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I know, boss.
So it's ten in total?
Let's see what you have.
Flush.
Hold your horses.
A full house.
Hey, good timing.
Go get some money.
They were meeting together.
The fucking son of a bitch.
He dares to leave me out?
I think Byung-doo did attorney PARK as you said.
I'm sorry it's been so long.
How's your health?
It's just so-so.
I need to cope with it.
Still, you'll get better soon.
Mom, remember how he used to be so considerate.
I told him not to come, but he kept on insisting that he wanted to see you.
Really?
thank you.
I heard you've become a filmmaker?
Yes.
I'm so happy for you.
Poor Byung-doo couldn't finish school because of me.
Mom, you don't need to say that here.
Byung-doo's far better offthan I am.
You've got yourself a good son.
You'd better tell some good stories to our director here.
Yes, boss.
Tell him everything.
Ask them anything you want to know.
Okay.
If you wantjuicy stuff, ask him.
He's had it rough.
He can stab you while smiling.
Jong-soo boss cried last night watching a TV drama.
You fucking ass, shut up!
Hey, watch it.
We have a guest here.
Sorry boss.
Oh, it's ok.
Jong-soo, what is that tattoo of?
It's interesting.
It's a forget-me-not.
Boss waters it sometimes like this...
Boss, my tattoo is prettier.
Hong-man's been watching over big boss's gang and says
Young-pil went down to Young-gwang today.
To Young-gwang?
Yeah, he didn't meet anyone in particular.
Just looked around.
Something's fishy.
When's Young-pil going in?
I heard after the big boss's sister's wedding.
Myung-goo, what do you want to do when you climb up in rank.
I want to find a good sponsor and make a fortune.
I wish to buy my own apartment someday.
Myung-goo and Hong-man are petite.
What made you wanna be a gangster?
Why boss, size dosen't matter.
The days offattening up eating dog food and shit are over.
These days, you can't survive like that.
You need brains and skills these days.
Gangsters need to study to read documents.
Excuse me.
- Yes, how may I help you?
Byung-doo!
Wow that's a lot of books there.
You read all of it?
Just the titles.
Hey, what happened last time?
You left in the middle of it.
Oh, something came up.
Hey, so how long have you been working here?
7~8 years.
Oh really?
Your legs must hurt from standing all day.
Well, that's how it is.
So, how's your mother?
She's doing well.
I remember she used to cook red bean noodles for me.
I crave it sometimes.
You have good memory.
Come over whenever you crave it.
Hey, so you're not dating anyone?
Nope.
And you?
Me?
I was too busy thinking of you.
Yeah right.
I'm serious.
Anyway, it's really nice to see you again.
Yeah.
Hey, I heard about what you do for living.
What did you hear?
That I'm a gangster?
- Yeah, Young-pil.
- Boss wants to see you.
- What?
- He said right now.
- Right now?
- Yes, boss.
- I see.
- Hurry up.
Alright.
You know what?
I need to get back to work.
Yeah.
Hey, is it okay if I came by once in a while?
No, why don't you call me when you're around here.
Why?
I don't want my friends to see me at work.
Alright.
- OK, bye.
- Bye.
- Come on in.
- You asked for me, boss?
Here's the wedding invitation.
Wow.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Sit down.
It's sad sending her off.
- So have you heard?
- Heard what?
Attorney PARK's missing.
Who?
Attorney PARK!
You met him in front ofthat karaoke.
Cops came by because ofthat.
Don't know why they're linking me with his absence.
What gangster in his sane mind would do that?
Knowing it would kill the whole organization.
Don't you agree?
Of course, boss.
By the way, go to Young-gwang this weekend after the wedding.
Young-gwang?
Do you remember Mr. JANG?
Go collect money from him.
Yes, boss.
Since that game room didn't work out for you, you can use half of it.
It'll be enough for you and your boys too.
Thanks, boss.
I kind of let you guys drift alone, didn't I?
It's hard with all these boys looking up to me.
I miss those days when we used to drought it together.
Yes, boss.
I want you to tell me if you feel like you're being mistreated.
You're the only one I have left, with Young-pil's going in soon.
He's done attorney PARK
Yes.
Then you should finish him off and teach Mr. HWANG a lesson.
I don't want to shed blood before the wedding.
He's going after the wedding so go after him and work quietly
Yes, boss.
This is melting in my mouth.
Boss, you should try some.
- Yeah, you go ahead eat.
- Okay.
This is for you guys.
Where is this from?
Get yourselves a new suit.
Thank you boss!
Let me ask you something.
What is a family?
What does a family mean to you?
Um, a family is like this, like us, boss.
A family is a mouth that eays from the same table.
One mouth, two... three, four... five, six... seven including myself
We are all one mouth.
- Understood?
- Yes, boss.
Then, what about the asshole that wanys to eat alone?
He's not a part ofthe family.
He's a fucking stranger.
Am I right?
Yes, boss!
♪ Echo waves reach everyone
♪ A land that split our youth
♪ Life is a turning water mill
♪ so follow the wind and the cloud
I think the boss knows.
Then we should hurry, boss.
It has to be done anyway.
We could get fucked before them ifwe wait too long.
Thank you.
Boss, nice to see you.
- How are you, boss?
- Ah, welcome.
- Congratulations, boss.
- Welcome.
Thanks.
They said it might rain, but I'm glad it isn't, boss.
Yeah, I know.
You must be missing her already, boss.
It's about time she got married.
Everyone, look over here.
One, two...
Thank you.
Would the friends ofthe groom and the bride come out to take a picture at the front ofthe aisle.
How's the food?
Thanks a lot!
- Boss.
- Yeah.
The car is ready.
Yeah, escort them to the airport
- and drive safely.
- Yes, boss.
Hey, Mr. NOH, come over here.
Man, it's so hard to see you around.
Yeah, long time no see.
Here, sit down.
I need to greet the guesys first.
- Have a drink before you go.
- Man, I can't resist.
The groom looks smart.
I heard he's from a good family.
So he's a fair match for my sister.
Of course, boss...
Well, I'm heading off to the airport, so I'll join you when I get back.
It's the least I can do for my boss.
You son of a bitch.
Alright.
Okay, see you later.
So how many years are you going in for?
Why don't you take all that money you're managing... and leave the country for a few years?
Boss, you wanna die here or leave?
Hey, you have a drink too.
Hold on.
Boss, it seems there are more guesys than expected.
I know.
Hey, nice suit.
Thanks.
It's a special day.
Shouldn't you be getting married soon too?
Not anytime soon, boss.
So when shall I visit Mr. JANG?
Huh?
Oh yeah, go tomorrow.
Mr. JANG isn't going to be easy to collect money from.
That's why appointed you to do the job.
Isn't that yours?
Oh, yes.
I don't know what to do with that gang.
Don't worry boss, I'll handle it.
- Okay.
- Long time no see, boss.
Who are you?
I met you at the funeral last time.
I'm with the Rotary gang, boss.
Oh, you're under Sang-chul.
How are you?
Doing great, boss.
Did you enjoy the food, boss?
Wedding food's always the same.
Then drink as much as you want.
We've prepared enough of it.
I guess Sang-chul boss is doing pretty well.
So many families came.
Sang-chul's always in good terms with everyone.
His boys are pretty smart too.
I heard someone's going in because ofthe game room.
Young-pil's supposed to go in.
When is he going in?
Right after the wedding, boss.
Is Sang-chul treating your family well too?
Of course, boss.
I see.
Yeah.
Good.
Let's finish it.
- Are we set?
- Yup.
- Okay, let's go.
- Yup.
I'll go with the driver and start unpacking.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Sun-ok might get lost later so wait for her at the bus stop.
Okay.
Let's go, mom.
Wait a minute.
Let me finish cleaning up.
You don't need to do that.
Of course I do.
One must clean after his place.
By the way, why are the cops coming for you these days?
Why are you being questioned?
What have you done?
I wish you'd stop living like that and start leading a normal life.
Can you stop.
And don't worry.
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'll find that book for you.
Could you come this way?
It's your book!
Would you want me to reserve the other book for you?
Yes, please.
We'll call you when it arrives.
Thank you.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
- This is all I could find.
- Thanks.
- Your boyfriend?
- No.
- He's good looking.
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
- Try this book.
- Okay.
So if I read this, it'll help us with our teamwork?
That's what the title implies.
Sounds nice.
I should buy more of it.
Hey, let's have dinner tonight.
Dinner?
- You're buying?
- Of course.
You'd better treat me to something delicious.
Miss KANG, what are you doing here?
Customers are waiting.
He's a customer too.
I'll be there soon.
Right now!
You're not eating any more?
I'm full.
I was going to treat you to something fancier.
Why noodles?
I just felt like it.
It's good.
By the way, what was that at the bookstore?
He was an ass.
Don't mind him.
Hey, why did you buy so many books?
They're for my employees.
I have an office now.
What kind of office?
I'm starting a real estate business.
Really?
I heard you're helping Min-ho with his movie.
I'm not much of a help.
I just told him some stories of how we live.
Hyun-joo, do you remember?
Remember what?
How we won first place in the relay race at school?
Yeah, of course I remember.
We used to stay after school to practice.
It was a lot offun.
Yeah
We used to go to Min-ho's place for noodles afterwards.
Yeah, we did.
Byung-doo.
Don't get offended by what I'm about to say... but I still can't believe you're doing that for living.
What?
I can't picture you as a gangster knowing how you used to be.
Hyun-joo.
Gangster's just a label.
I'm not as bad as you think.
You'll find out as you see me more often.
I guess Hyun-joo thinks of you a lot, sending you this.
What kind oftree is this?
It doesn't have branches.
It's a Lucky Tree.
It rarely blossoms but if it does, something good's supposed to happen.
I hope it blossoms so you can make a fortune.
A Lucky Tree.
Man, she's a woman ofwit.
- Hey, Hippo.
- Yes, boss.
Take special care ofthat.
If you let it die, you die with it.
Yes, boss.
Hey, Byung-doo.
You must've landed a good sponsor.
No, some boss helped me out.
Oh yeah, that boss has a daughter who wanys to be an actress.
Can you cast her for your movie?
Why not.
If it's your request,
I'll meet her next time.
Do you need help?
You have something schique and comfortable at the same time?
What size does the lady wear?
Try to find one this length.
- I'm sorry?
- This length.
Let's have a talk with dinner.
Why not?
Here are in front of company.
Let's have a talk.
I said no.
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong with you?
You can't do this to me.
You're not supposed to do this anymore.
Not do what?
Hyun-joo, let's start again.
I said I'll try harder.
Does your wife know you're still doing this?
Why are you mentioning her?
This is about us.
I don't want to talk with you.
Give me my purse.
Why are you avoiding me?
Give it back to me.
You can't leave until we're done talking.
Give it back.
- Let's talk this over.
- Hyun-joo.
Hey man, she said she wanys to go.
What?
Who is this?
I'm Hyun-joo's friend.
A friend?
So what?
Byung-doo, let's go.
Give me my purse.
Oh... so there was a reason...
All that was for him?
- Hey man.
- Hey man?
Can't you see I have something to discuss with Hyun-joo?
Discuss what?
She said no.
It's okay, let's go.
Hyun-joo.
Wait in my car.
Go to my car.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Give me the purse.
Give it to me!
You son of a bitch...
Hey, hold right there!
I said hold right there!
Fucking son of a bitch!
You motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!
What's wrong?
- Let me go.
- What did I do wrong?
- Was it that bad what I did?
- What?
You saw what happened.
He asked for it.
I'm sorry if it scared you.
But I'm not sorry for him.
Don't come to see me anymore.
What?
I don't like gangsters.
So don't come to see me.
What are you saying?
You scare me.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Hey, you can't sit there forever.
Go home now.
I said someone's coming.
Nobody's coming.
Shit, just wait and see.
Hey, Byung-doo, Byung-doo.
Man, you're so fucking heavy.
Why did you drink so much?
- Min-ho...
- What?
Shit...
Why is life so fucking hard?
What are you talking about?
Life sucks.
Hey, you really not gonna eat?
No.
I'm staying over tonight.
It's messy like your place so make yourself at home.
I remember when I used to deliver for your restaurant.
Your mom used to hate seeing you hanging out with me.
Really?
The owner's son and the delivery boy, both pathetic.
Man, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said such a thing.
No, it's okay.
It's true what you said.
Did you find the picture we talked about last time?
The picture?
Yeah.
I was going to give it to you.
Isn't Hyun-joo really cute?
Hey, how are things going between you guys?
Min-ho, do I scare you too?
Why?
Did someone say you're scary?
I...
I never regretted being a gangster but today,
I feel shitty.
You're really weird today.
Did something happen?
Just thought I shouldn't be doing things I was doing.
I tried everything to make money... doing dirty work with sashimi knife.
Still, nothing changed about this shitty life.
I don't know what happened but you're not the only one.
I've been living like this for 3 years to make a movie.
Hey, did you really use a sashimi knife?
Why?
It sounds so unreal.
May because you're my friend.
When did you get that scar on your shoulder?
This?
You know... when I was fighting over that game room.
Ah...
Is that scar from a knife?
Yeah.
I wonder what it's like being stabbed.
Have you ever stabbed anyone?
I'm no different from the rest.
What does it feel like?
Stabbing?
Feels like shit.
You're not yourselfwhen you do it.
Yeah.
I can't imagine it.
That's why you shouldn't look into their eyes...
If you do, it will haunt you
for the rest of your life.
Nobody will understand...
I can't get it out of my mind.
Hey, who did you stab?
What's wrong with you today?
This is the bird's eye view ofthe apartment complex.
The total sales profit will be around 451 .8 billion won and the cost of land, construction, and selling...
All those will be replaced by beautiful apartmenys.
A shopping mall over there and a subway line there.
Imagine the scale of money selling 1 ,500 uniys.
We'll get at least five hundred if everything works out well.
Five hundred uniys?
I can't imagine it, boss.
It could be more.
But it won't be easy driving out the locals.
The landlords probably heard about the development by now.
They'll expect compensation.
You think you can handle it?
Yes, I'll do it, boss.
Good.
If you help me dig those grounds,
I'll give you 50 uniys.
- Really, boss?
- Of course.
I'm here because of you.
I'll make sure it happens.
Your scenario was good.
Why didn't you do it sooner?
Pardon me?
I guess all those interviews paid off.
The characters seemed real and the story's good.
Oh, really?
- Let's do it.
- What?
Let's get the actors together and start tomorrow.
Ah, yeah.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
♪ Her beautiful smile

Lady, sell it.
Shit, you're holding up our construction business.
Should we come by at night and bury her?
Boss, let's do that.
I know a good mountain for digging.
Things will only get worse.
We'll pay you some extra.
How many times do I need to tell you.
I can't sell it.
I lived here for 30 years and it's all I've got for my sons
So your second son is a senior in high school?
Excuse me?
Boss, we couldn't find the owners ofthe five houses.
They're probably hiding.
I think the Serpenys' got them.
I guess they want a part in this too.
The matter's serious if it's the Serpenys though.
My boys will find those five landlords soon.
As long as we find one, the rest will come out easy.
Do it quietly.
An all-out war isn't easy.
- Yes, boss.
- Your guest has arrived.
- Hey, Min-ho.
Come here.
- Hello, director KIM.
Welcome.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to ask you to come when you must be so busy.
It's no problem.
I heard a lot about you from Byung-doo.
He seems very proud of you.
Really?
How's it coming along?
We'll go into shooting soon.
First of all, congratulations.
And thanks for casting my daughter.
She's good for the role.
Byung-doo helped me it's the least I could do.
It'd better be a big hit.
Thanks.
You can count on me, boss.
Make a blockbuster, Min-ho.

May I help you?
Do you know where Ms. KANG Hyun-joo is?
She didn't come to work today.
I'm a friend of hers.
Could you give this to her for me?
She's sick, so she's taking some days off.
Really?
Hyun-joo!
Open the door.
I said open the door!
Come out!
Open the door.
You'd better open the door.
I'm gonna break in.
Hyun-joo!
Is she okay?
The doctor will be here soon.
Why didn't you call home if you were this sick?
I must say this is excellent although I made it.
I used to get beat to get the recipe right for this.
Try it.
Tryjust a bite then, for my sake.
Why are you crying?
Eat so you can recover.
What the...?
♪ I'm tired of waiting Digger Digger
♪ Tired of waiting Digger Digger
♪ I'm so lonely tonight
This is expensive, you know.
100% natural honey...
Man, it's sweet!
It's sweet, ain't it?
There are loys of anys and digger bees in this mountain.
Won't it be nice to see happens for a few days?
Where's are they?
Did we get everything?
Things got complicated, boss.
Why?
I was just working on those five and it seems Serpent's got the papers himself.
What?
Serpent has them?
Fucking son of a bitch.
What shall we do, boss?
Kill them, until they tell you where Serpent is.
Yes, boss.
Who are you?
Mr. KIM, it's not polite to mess with others' business.
Who the fuck are you?
Your mother seemed ill.
Who are you?
And isn't it dangerous after dark for a pretty girl like your sister?
Byung-doo, what's wrong?
What's going on?
Sun-ok, hurry up and pack.
We're leaving right now.
Mom says she's not going.
What's happening?
Stay at uncle's place for a few days.
Where's Byung-sik?
He hasn't come home in a couple of days.
That son of a bitch.
Hurry, what are you doing?
I'm not leaving my house.
What did you do this time?
Just listen to me this once.
I can't deal with this anymore.
First it was cops, now we have to hide from gangsters?
We can manage on our own, go hide by yourself.
Your bad example messed up Byung-sik as well.
Shit!
You think I come here because I want to?
Who's gonna take care of Byung-sik and Sun-ok?
Stop shouting at mom.
I won't ask you to take care of us.
So get out!
Okay, I'll leave
So do whatever you want.
Where are they, boss?
Call Jong-soo and tell him to send some boys over to my house.
Yes, boss.
Yes!
We'll take care ofthem.
We'll bury them as soon as we find out where they are.
Okay, boss.
What did the boss say?
To finish everything tonight.
Okay.
Since they love land so much, we'll bury them.
We'll do what they did to our boys, when we find them.
Of course.
Can't believe we're going through all this trouble for Axe.
He shouldn't have got caught by them.
Boss, won't we get something for rescuing all ofthem?
I'm sure we will as soon as the boss geys things settled.
You know, Axe is a fucking psycho.
Remember when we went to collect money from Royal Billiards?
Axe forgot to bury him afterwards.
Lighter, lighter.
When we went back the tide water had already reached right below his eyes.
He could've died.
Isn't he a dumb ass, boss?
It geys even better.
When we got there, he looking up at me with these sad pleading eyes.
Then all of a sudden a stream of water shot out of nowhere.
You know what it was?
Eui-jung was pissing on him.
Isn't that something?
He must've been pissing in his panys himself.
I'm sure he was, boss.
All those Mokpo bitches are in the past, boss.
You lying bitch...
What?
What the...
Stop the car!
Motherfucker!
Where's Serpent?
Stay still, bitch.
Hurry, get him in the car.
This is Serpent's.
These are the rest ofthe landlords.
The land is open for construction now.
Good job.
You're ruthless.
What about the Serpenys?
They're resolved for good?
Of course, boss.
After the authorization, we're set for good.
Don't forget about my share, boss.
Of course, you'll get your share.
- Cut
- It's a cut.
It's very different from real life...
I know, boss.
Practice!
Everything nice and all, but actions seem too sophisticated.
Can't we get it a bit more realistic?
Realistic?
How?
Maybe you can take out thatjumping round kick.
You said it was okay on the first round.
You should've said it earlier then.
Now we have to change the whole routine.
This just isn't the type of action I was thinking of...
OK then, no jumping round kick.
What else?
I don't know what you want so tell me specifically.
- Min-ho.
- Yes.
He's the martial arts choreographer?
Yeah, why?
Hi, I was just watching.
I'm sorry to butt in, but the fight doesn't seem real.
Min-ho, real gangsters don't fight like this.
Hey, Jong-soo!
Come over here.
- Hurry up.
- Yes, boss.
Stand right here.
You see.
A punch should always fly low.
Keep it low and give it a sting at the end.
Like this.
This is how you do it.
I'm fine but the crew seems to feel a bit uncomfortable.
I guess I made a mistake.
I was only trying to help.
I know.
They're all really sensitive right now with stress.
Yeah, then I'll head off.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you soon
When it's all over.
Yeah, good luck with the rest ofthe shooting.
Min-ho!
Make something with a real Gangster spirit.
See you.
You're off early today.
It's been a while.
How were you?
You feel better now?
I'm much better now.
Good.
You don't seem happy to see me.
People are watching, hurry, take it.
Actually, I went the book shop several times to see you.
But I couldn't say hi to you.
Thought you'd feel uncomfortable.
But I'm glad you look better.
Oh yeah, thank you for the other day.
You're a good cook.
Yeah, then get sick again.
So I can cook for you again.
How do you like this place?
It's really nice to be out after working inside all day.
It's like another world, another life in there.
I'll take you to a better place next time.
I saw you wearing new shoes.
Does it fit?
How did you know my size?
Just an eye measurement.
I'm always receiving things from you.
What is it?
What's the event?
Nothing...
I just wanted to celebrate something.
Enjoy your cake...
What did you want to celebrate?
Remember you sent me a Lucky tree?
It blossomed today.
Really?
That's really rare.
Yeah I know, but it did.
If something good really happens, it's because of you.
I had fun today.
Getting some fresh air...
You're a good conversationist and smiled a lot too today.
You helped me.
I haven't had such a good time in a while.
- Really?
- Yeah!
Yeah.
Next time, I'm buying.
Cool.
Don't you invite me for a cup of coffee?
Coffee?
It's too late tonight.
I'll make it for you next time.
Okay.
I can't believe it's time to go already.
Drive safely.
And thanks for the flowers.
Yup.
Hyun-joo!
Hold on.
Hyun-joo, can I like you?
You still hate me?
No, it's just...
I'm not sure...
Hyun-joo, if you want,
I can quit being a gangster.
To tell you the truth, I've never liked anyone but you.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
Congratulations.
Seems like a hit.
- Hey, thanks.
- Min-ho.
- You're here.
- You did a greatjob.
Everybody's talking about how good the movie it.
It's good.
It's a good piece ofwork.
Really?
You must work with me next time then.
Thank you.
Director!
Hey, Ji-ae
- Hello, Director.
- Hi.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for coming.
Did Ji-ae cause you trouble?
No, she was great.
Director, I think it's a hit.
Everyone's talking about it.
Yeah.
I wish you best of luck.
By the way, didn't you invite Byung-doo?
I tried calling him but he wouldn't pick up.
Right, he's so busy these days with work.
I see.
Let's have a drink sometime.
Sure.
Have more.
I hope you like it.
It tastes exactly like when I had it in elementary.
I'm glad.
Take some home with you.
She's made plenty.
It's not worth taking home.
Hyun-joo, come over often.
Okay.
A tip for my sister-in-law, it tastes better with salt and sugar.
You're embarrassing her.
It's my wishful thinking.
Byung-doo, you'd like that too.
You've become a different person ever since you've been dating her.
No I haven't.
Your brother always talks about you.
How pretty and smart you are.
Really?
I'm so happy you're with him.
He has a good heart.
Always bringing all sorts of medicine.
You need to get well soon.
Yes, boss.
Where are you?
I'm having dinner with my family.
So oblivious...
Pardon?
Are you alright?
What kind of driving is that?
I'm sorry, I had a small drink...
I'm sorry.
What?
You're driving drunk?
Let me see your license.
I don't have one.
Then let me see your ID.
I don't have that either.
No ID?
What kind of person would drive without a license?
- You know who I am?
- I sure do.
Hello, attorney Choi!
Long time no see.
Who did you do it to?
Go ahead and tell me.
Min-ho.
I took my boss.
Why?
There must've been a reason for taking him.
You wouldn't do that to your boss for no reason.
You can't tell anyone about this...
How far does he know?
I didn't mention anything about you.
Trust me, boss.
Are you out of your mind?
How could you tell him?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
Why did Sang-chul end up that way?
What will happen if your friend went about telling everyone?
He won't do such a thing, boss.
How can you be sure?
You did it.
You clean it up.
Look over here, good.
Okay, once more.
Now, hold your fisys, pose like a gangster.
Smile a little more.
A little more, good!
Your characters are very real.
Did you interview real gangsters?
I watched a lot of gangster movies like "THE GODFATHER" and "SCARFACE".
I'm sorry, I should've called you.
Why did you do that?
I trusted you when I told you that.
You shouldn't have done it if you considered me your friend.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, but...
Sorry?
What ifthis ruins me?
You don't give a fuck, do you?
Hey, listen to me.
Listen to what?
I thought hard about it.
I figured it would be harmless.
Everyone knows about the case and anyone could've don
You've watched it too.
It's not about you.
I made it up.
Think about it.
Kim Mim-ho.
Okay, let's say it was my mistake.
But gangsters can do anything to cover their mistakes.
You wondered what it'd be like being stabbed.
Let me sayjust one thing.
Shut up for the rest of your life.
Okay?
Can you do that?
Yes.
I'll take it to my grave.
If something happens, I'm not going down alone.
Got it?
You trust him?
I don't.
He even made it into a movie.
I said I got it under control.
Stop talking about it.
And start gathering boys for the model house.
If you can't do it because he's your friend,
I'll do it.
What?
Leave it up to me.
You son of a bitch!
You stay out ofthis.
What do you mean, stay out of it, boss?
It's my business so you can stay out of it!
Boss, this isn't just about you.
Our whole family's on the line.
Why are you covering for that fucking bastard?
Will you take care of us, ifwe all get fucked up?
You son of a bitch!
Shit.
I'll fucking shut you up.
Didn't I say I got it under control?
Don't you ever mention that in front of me again.
Long time no see, boss.
Stop.
Boss... how could you?
Unlike our boss,
I don't know you very well,
Ain't that so you pussy.
Sorry to worry you, boss.
I got everything under control now.
- Don't make another mistake.
- Yes, boss.
Model house and sales start next week.
So be prepared.
Yes, boss.
Our boss saved you this time.
But we'll be watching you.
Better keep your mouth shut.
We're on the same boat now.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your help.
It's doing well.
Yes, I'm glad.
What was the competition rate for sales contract until yesterday?
It was 50 to 1 until this morning.
I knew it would do well.
- You did?
- Thank you.
We brought more boys.
Set them over there to lift the atmosphere.
- Okay.
- Okay, boss.
Mr. HWANG, the competition is now 70 to 1 .
The banks are panicking.
They running out of applications.
Good, keep checking!
Congratulations, boss.
It's a huge success.
You did a lot ofwork.
Prepare a big feast for the employees tonight.
Let's go in.
Digger!
Hey, Myung-goo!
What is a family?
It's a mouth that eays from the same table.
That's right.
Our family will go all the way!

So, why did you call me?
Is something troubling you?
Byung-doo!
Can you come with me?
What is it?
What's the good news?
Tell me.
Not here, come with me.
I'm busy right now.
How about after work?
I can't wait that long.
What is it?
Tell me!
I wanted to say it in a better setting.
Take this first.

Boss, sorry to come by like this.
Jong-gyu, step ouyside for a while.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, boss.
So what is your plan?
You're gonna hide forever?
I'll clean up the mess since I caused it.
I'll take Min-ho.
What?
I'll finish him and I'll leave the country too.
He's big now.
Things can get more complicated.
I can do it, boss.
Just make sure you give me my share.
It's all my family can depend on.
Just in case things go wrong,
I won't mention your name.
The movie broke the record and sold five million tickeys.
Thank you again.
Now let me introduce director KIM Min-ho.
Hello, I'm KIM Min-ho, the director ofthe movie.
I'm happy to meet all of you.
Thank you for watching our movie.
There were some difficult momenys in making this movie, but I never dreamed a day like this would come.
- Yeah, Jong-soo.
- We are arrived.
I'll be right there.
It was crazy going into that theater.
I'm glad we hired those bodyguards.
Thanks detective!
Why do you look so down?
You should cheer up on a day like this.
Let's have a drink.
Come on, director!
Let's have a drink.
I don't want to ruin this, but I should leave now.
- You can't leave!
- No you can't, director!
We're going clubbing after this.
Come on!
I feel ashamed...
Leting you guys down...
I should've listened to you.
That was my biggest mistake.
What good is it to regret the past, boss?
We just need to try solving it.
After this, while I'm gone, you guys live quietly for 2 years.
And be a good boss to the boys while I'm gone.
- Okay, boss.
- Boss!
How are you?
Good, what's going on?
They're about to go somewhere else.
Okay.
I'll go ahead, you wait ouyside.
Be careful, boss.
- Is this on you?
- I told you, everything's on me!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Director, you need to drink with us!
- Sang-hee, make him drink.
- Come on, director!
Director, let's do a love shot!
Love shot!
Love shot!
There you go, you can drink!
The best director!
You must be tired.
You must be more tired than me, detective.
I'm used to this, it's myjob.
Detective, why don't you have a drink with us too?
Oh no, I'm fine.
I met him when I went to the station.
He's been a lot of help.
Hold on.
- Yes?
- Director, where are you?
Me?
Director, where were you?
I was in the men's room.
Come on!
Let's go dance.
No, not me.
You have to go with us.
- Let's go together.
- No, I'm okay.
Close all the exiys!
We've got Min-ho, boss.
Really?
Okay, I'll meet you there.
I'm here.
Where are you?
Catch him!
Son of a bitch!
Fucking...
Who are you?
Fucking
Catch him!
Son of a bitch!
Boss!
What's going on?
Boss, something went wrong.
Let's clean up.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.
We're nearly there.
What?
What do you mean?
Yes, boss.
- Turn the car around.
- Yes, boss.
Thank you
I'll see you at the house after the funeral.
Yes, boss.
Thank you.
Bye.
You came...
Go in and call me.
Has Byung-doo called?
Not since his last text message a few days ago...
Really?
Don't worry too much.
He'll come back soon.
Yeah.
- Okay, take care.
- Bye.
- You go ahead drink first.
- Yes, sir.
So what is your next movie going to be about?
I haven't decided yet.
How about my past love story?
Excuse me?
You see, I've had a hell of a drama in my love life.
Oh, I see...
Let's meet often to talk about it.
If you like the story, you don't need to worry about the money.
Since you're good at making up stories,
I think you'll do it well.
Oh, no, no, really...
But don't make it too similar, my wife might kill me.
Yup, a fiction will always be a fiction.
- Your guest has arrived.
- How are you, boss?
Good.
Come on in.
What are you waiting for?
Bring them in!
I'll bring them right in.
They're important guest, so treat them as you best clienys.
Of course.
You know Jong-soo?
Yes.
You know the director?
Yes, boss.
I know him well.
Since you won't be in Seoul for a while, drink up and enjoy.
Thank you, boss.
And congratulations for winning the award.
Leys forget the past and start fresh.
Cheers!
This is one of my favorite songs.
The lyrics are good.
Hey, Min-ho.
Make something with a real Gangster spirit.
Bye!

A DIRTY CARNIVAL
ZO In-sung
You fucking bastard, you think you're a gangster?
You wanna be a gangster too?
Fucking bastard!
Let go.
Beats up a person and throws away money.
I have to admit he's good for nothing though he's my son.
He's out of his mind!
He needs years behind bars before he comes to his senses
Stop it already.
We should be thankful they accepted our offer.
By the way, what shall we do?
We only have a month to move out.
Where can we get that much money?
I'll find a way.
No, it's okay.
I'll get the money somehow this time.
Don't worry mom, I said I'll take care of it.
You wanna get sick again?
This is for Sun-ok's academy and your medication.
Do you still have chest pains?
They're tolerable.
You'd better not be seen with those scamps again.
Next time, I'm gonna break your legs.
- See ya.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Drive safely and come by more often.
I think mom's condition's gotten worse these days.
OK.
Here.
A cellphone?
It's not for you to chat and text message with your friends
I can keep it?
Call mom whenever you're late from the academy.
OK.
Go in.
Oh, KIM Byung-doo?
I know him well.
Really?
How do you know him?
I was in charge of the Rotary gang.
I met him then.
How do you know him?
He's my friend from elementary.
Oh, he's your friend?
Yeah.
I've been asking every policeman I met to find him
Then, good for you.
You should see him then, rather than talking to me
If it's for your movie, you should talk to the gangster himself.
I guess so.
You motherfuckers!
You think you can leave whenever you want?
You think this is some kinda club?
A fucking picnic?
Straighten up.
Hello, boss.
Why did you bring them back if they didn't we anymore?
- Jong-soo.
- Yes, boss.
From now on, cut their fingers before they leave.
Yes, boss.
- You, youngest!
- Yes, boss.
- It's tough isn't it?
- No, it's OK, boss.
Let's bear it a little longer.
Since we're already here, might as well go all the way.
- Hey, Hippo!
- Yes, boss.
What's our philosophy?
Yes, boss.
Never lose face, never get jumped on,
Get your shoes polished even if you skip a meal.
Though we may starve to death, we should never fail to respect ourselves
So what do you become the minute you lose integrity?
A scamp!
Am I right?
- Yes, boss.
- Right, boss.
Let's try our best.
Everybody cheer up.
Let's go working!
Yes, boss.
Apartment number 108-503!
Bitch, gimme my money!
CHOI Sun-duk!
Pay back if you borrowed my money!
Residents of building 108!
My family's starving because Apt. 503 won't pay me back!
Who are you calling a bitch!
Honey, call the police!
Go ahead, call again.
Let's go by the fucking law.
You're going a bit too far, young man.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't have any money!
Hello?
Sun-ok?
Byung-doo?
Can you hear me?
Yup.
Got good connection.
What's up?
I forgot to say thank you for the cellphone.
Hey, go back your studying and don't waste your time calling me.
The fruit of patience is what?
It's sweet.
Gotta go, I'm working.
Damn, what are you doing?
Do it harder, make me hard.
Higher, higher, that's right.
- Right there.
Good.
- Get back to your room.
I was hurting right there.
Today it's chrysanthemum, tomorrow it's rose.
You'll fall asleep tired from flirting!
I'm tired of waiting, Digger Digger!
Tired of collecting money, Digger!
I'm so lonely tonight oh no!
Who are you under?
Fucking son of a bitch.
I'm so fucking busy getting ready for my business, how could I fucking interrupt yours?
Fucking dick heads!
What?
Yeah, go ahead!
We're gonna open as planned.
Do whatever you want!
Bring your axe and shit!
- Hey!
- Yes, boss.
why did you make it so noticeable?
Sorry, boss.
I tried my best.
We might as well clean them up for good this time, boss!
Leave it.
Don't make things big.
Take care of it at your level.
Yes, boss.
Later, boss.
Boss, is everything okay?
Yeah, the game room...
so you got it?
Yes, boss.
Good.
Here, this is for you.
Boss, give us a bit more.
Hey, times are difficult for me too.
Getting my only sister married costs a shit load.
A bit more, boss.
We can't even pay rent these days.
Dumb ass, getting cheated by your own sponsor...
Let's wait till things get better.
You said that before, boss.
What!
Boss, can't you just pretend you skipped a racecourse bet?
You fucking with me?
How dare you fuck with me...
Byung-doo, how old are you this year?
Twenty-nine, boss.
Twenty-nine, huh?
And look at yourself.
Still begging for money...
Shouldn't you be getting somewhere by now?
Six villas and 20% a month.
Get them notarized...
Why waste money?
We are the notary.
Then make sure you get all the right documents.
Right, boss.
How are you, boss!
Yes, Byung-doo!
Heard you did a great job.
It's nothing.
No, no, That wasn't easy money to get back.
Sang-chul's got a smart kid under him.
All my boys are smart, boss.
Byung-doo, we're about to go for a drink.
Join us.
Don't mind me.
Come along.
You can be boss's designated driver.
I like you cause you don't look like a gangster.
Gangsters need to look like this nowadays.
It's hard to do business looking like him.
Boss, I've been getting facials.
Byung-doo, got a sponsor?
No boss.
Not anymore.
Things didn't work out, boss.
His sponsor flew with our investment money.
It's hell of a situation, boss.
Then why don't you let him manage the new game room?
Yes, boss.
I was thinking about that.
I love you, boss.
Oh my god, oh my god, don't do this to me.
A girl's heart is like a reed.
Don't do this.
Don't ask.
Don't ask any more.
Hello.
Yes, I'm having a drink with some employees.
I'm afraid I can't right now.
Yes.
Give me some more time.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
I can't believe I love you.
Though you're not a knight in a shining armor
Fucking asshole!
What a pain in the ass.
But try to work things out.
- Sang-chul.
- Yes, boss.
Why don't you take attorney PARK for me?
What?
Couldn't you quietly solve this situation?
What do you mean?
I can't sleep well knowing he's pulling my strings.
If you do it for me, I got your back for the rest of your life.
Can you do it?
Boss, we'll all get fucked.
You know that boss.
I'll do anything, but an attorney...
It's a different matter.
Right.
I knew it'd be hard.
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks.
You're raking in money.
Rake in my ass.
- Thanks for coming.
- Okay.
Heard you're gonna be in charge of this place.
- Yes.
- Good luck, boy.
It's a good location, all it needs is a good management.
This is just the beginning.
Soon, we'll own several of these.
We need to get a good sponsor and start making a fortune.
By the way boss, we're gonna have some trouble with the Three-way gang.
This is their district, isn't it?
Hey, I'm going for a drink with the guests.
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay, boss.
Okay.
Jong-soo, gimme some light.
Yes, boss.
You've come a long way smoking in front of me.
It's a special day, boss.
Let me smoke just this one.
So you like driving that BMW?
You know it's not my car.
Son of a bitch
Stop going around kissing boss's ass and act right.
What?
I heard you've been making trouble at Three-way's game room.
Are you going to fight them alone if they gain up on us?
What are you scared about?
It needs to happen anyway.
Hey, this business is mine.
Don't you butt in.
Byung-doo!
Hey, Min-ho!
KIM Min-ho, you son of a bitch!
Hey, long time no see.
Yeah, it's been a while.
How long has it been, man?
I know.
It's been ages.
Hey, you still look the same.
You too, man.
I could spot you out in an instant.
Oh yeah?
So why is it so hard to see you?
I looked up everywhere to find you.
Oh yeah?
Detective WOO called this morning.
He says you're a filmmaker?
I'm working on something.
Man, it's so cool I have a friend who's a film director.
What about you Byung-doo?
How's work?
I'm running that place and doing this and that.
Heard you wanted to meet gangsters?
Yeah, I'm preparing a gangster movie.
I met some detectives,
Now I need to meet some gangsters.
I don't know if it'll help.
They're just like normal people.
Still...
I need to learn about their world.
Hey, are you still keeping in touch with elementary friends?
Sure, I see them once in a while at the reunion events.
Then have you seen KANG Hyun-joo?
Yeah, I saw her at the last gathering.
You remember her?
I remember my close friends.
So, how is she doing?
I heard she works at a book store.
Yeah, what...
Jong-soo?
Son of a bitch
Mother fucker!
Fucker!
Fucking motherfuckers.
Come in all of you!
- Young-pil!
- Yes, boss.
Call the Three-way fucks.
Yes, boss.
- Byung-doo!
- Yes, boss.
It's war.
Gather all the boys.
Yes, boss.
Young-pil...
where are you?
Stuck in traffic?
Shit!
We're nearly there so get here as soon as you can!
Shit, run them over!
Open the trunk!
Open the trunk!
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Shit
Son of a bitch!
Boss!
What was he thinking?
Big boss made things messy gutting that boy for nothing
Boss, isn't our whole family in deep shit if he dies?
Shut up!
Let's wait till the boss gets things settled
Big boss'd better not forget us, after everything we did this time.
Yeah, Sun-ok, what?
Why on earth would you join the demonstration?
You're ill.
You have any idea how dangerous they are?
You thought they'd build around our house if you protested?
What else could I do?
By the way, what happened to your face?
Were you in a fight again?
Never mind my face.
You and Byung-sik, both of you...
It's all my fault.
Don't use your fists anymore.
Wars are outdated now.
You have to use your brains, Not your sashimi knives.
Yes, boss.
So how did you settle it?
We paid some compensation and Young-pil is going in.
- Young-pil is?
- Yes, boss.
I asked him to do it for me.
So I let his boys take care of the game room.
Boss, what do you mean?
I had to do it.
It was the least I could do for him.
Boss...
Sir, attorney PARK wants to see you in the next room.
Attorney PARK's here?
Who told him I was here?
Oh, did I make a mistake?
What shall I tell him?
Tell him I'll be there.
This asshole is a stumbling block in my life.
Boss, just have a drink with him.
Go to boss's car and wait.
Boss, can I talk to you?
What is it?
How can you do this to me?
You need to understand.
Boss, did I ever disobey you?
What is it that Young-pil did that I didn't do for you?
I know.
Next time, OK?
Boss, please...
just this once.
Our family is about to get thrown out to the streets.
Please reconsider, boss.
Then you wanna go in instead of Young-pil?
- See you again.
- Yeah, see you next time.
Yes.
- Is boss's car ready?
- Yes, boss.
- Hey!
- Yes?
- What's this?
- Oh, he's with me.
Meet attorney PARK.
He's a gangster too then.
Hey, come over here.
Fucking gangsters...
Parasites of our society...
Loser like this should be all sucked up with a vacuum cleaner.
Why don't you leave the poor kid alone.
Hey, Myung-geun.
You're neither a civilian nor a gangster.
What are you?
A mutt?
Act straight.
Let's have a smoke.
Yes.
People need to age gracefully.
Attorneys aren't easy.
How old are you?
Twenty-nine, boss.
That's when Sang-chul came.
He was quick back then.
He's come a long way...
or maybe went too far.
There's so much to do but it's hard to find someone who'll last.
You should find a good sponsor and start making real money.
You can't be a gangster forever.
Thanks for your advice, boss.
Byung-doo, you just need to know two things to be successful.
Who you need, and what he needs...
It seems Sang-chul doesn't need anything anymore.
Thanks for driving.
Good night, boss.
Think of me as your big brother.
- Yeah.
- Go home now.
Good night.
Sorry for coming back, boss.
It's okay.
What is it?
Do you have a name card of that attorney?
This is serious stuff.
All our necks are on the line.
You don't have to join me.
I'll do it myself if you're not in.
How can you say such a thing.
We're both outsiders, starting out as club waiters...
When will we make our fortune living like this?
Do you think we can ever find another sponsor like this?
Jong-soo!
Yes, boss.
Trust me on this one.
Yes, boss.
I'm here because of you.
I'll go if you go.
Good.
Let's go for it.
See if you can find out anything.
Work quietly.
Mr. CHOI!
How are you?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I was waiting for you but you didn't come...
Right, we had an appointment.
Sorry I forgot.
It's not a problem.
But, can I talk to you for a minute?
Right now?
I can't.
I have a meeting.
How about tomorrow?
See you tomorrow.
Then, have you read my scenario?
Your scenario?
Why don't you look for something else?
What?
The story hasn't changed a bit since last time.
If it's a gangster movie, it needs something strong.
but this one...
the storyline's just bland.
Plus, there's no gangster in this gangster movie.
Look for something else.
I'll change it... one last time.
I'm doing real interviews with some gangsters right now.
I'll make it realistic this time.
You just wait, motherfuckers.
I'll make something huge.
Hey!
- You found this place.
- Yeah, it wasn't hard.
What's up with you these days?
I couldn't get a hold of you.
Are you busy these days?
Yeah, the business is busy.
I'm sorry about the other day.
Things just happen and shit...
Yeah, I saw what happened.
Man, what was that fight over?
You saw?
Just the usual territory fight.
Man, that was some action.
It's my first time seeing gangsters fight.
Did you get hurt or anything?
I'm fine.
So what is it that you had to see me so urgently?
Oh, that...
I'll tell you as we go.
Go where?
Where are we going?
You'll see once we get there.
Where are you taking me...
It was such a spectacle when the fat boy got smashed.
We couldn't go that way since then thanks to this son of a bitch.
That's right.
Byung-doo, you used to be so athletic.
Don't you guys remember?
Our class won that relay run because of him.
Yeah, that's right.
Man, it's so good to see you again.
I know.
Yeah, come out more often.
Yeah, okay.
Help Min-ho with his film too.
It's about time he made something.
Hey, stop.
Who knows?
When he becomes famous maybe he'll bring some gorgeous actresses with him.
As if I'll have time for you guys.
- You arrogant son of a bitch.
- Whatever!
Hey, Min-ho, I think I'd better go in now.
Why?
Stay a little longer.
Hyun-joo will come soon.
This prick finally showed up.
I guess he did.
It's a bet!
Hey guys, he's betting two hundred for whoever finishes the pie in twenty seconds.
Twenty seconds?
Anyone can do that!
Whoever eats it can take it.
You'd better keep your word.
- OK, Two hundred!
- You guys, join us.
Alright, bring on the pie.
- Byung-doo, try it.
- Hey, let's do it.
One, two, start!
Stop!
Who's finished it?
He ate all.
For real?
Open your mouth.
What the...
Byung-doo, take it.
Forget it.
Use it to pay for the drinks.
Hey, Hyun-joo!
Sorry, sorry.
Come sit over here.
Why are you so late?
Work ended late today.
You're always late.
- You'd better pay penalty.
- Okay, next stop's on me.
Hyun-joo.
You know how long Byung-doo waited for you?
Hey, Byung-doo.
Hey, it's been a long time.
It's so good to see you.
You still look the same.
Really?
What do you mean?
She's aged.
You wanna die?
So when are you going to get married, Hyun-joo?
Hey, ask me after you find me a man first.
Hey, you know how much Byung-doo missed you?
Really?
Hey, I never said that.
Why not?
I missed him too.
She runs away when I approach her
Looks away when I glance at her
Time keeps passing by while
I wonder if she knows how I feel
She swifts by me, and though I try to ignore it
Aren't you glad you came today?
Let's see each other more often.
You know how much I missed you?
Min-ho, today's just perfect.
Yeah...
I may not run like a child I may not chase the butterfly but I'll stay by you forever
And flow by you like the river
I could run, I could fly.
If you came into my heart.
Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You rock.
- Hyun-joo!
Fighting!
- Fighting!
I could run, I could fly.
If you came into my heart.
Drive safely, I'll call again.
Not too close.
Run in.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Hey, what the hell is wrong with your driving?
I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off.
Don't you know any better not to drive when you're sleepy?
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the damage.
- Let me get your name card.
- Yes, sure.
Aren't you attorney PARK?
You know me?
Yeah, I'm OH Jong-soo.
Don't you remember me?
OH Jong-soo?
Have we met before?
I saw you at the Rainbow.
Why don't you eat some food as well.
The food here is really good.
Yes, boss.
You look healthier than before.
Really?
I'm working out more, running two extra kilometers.
I must live long enough to spend all that money I have.
Of course, boss.
How's getting ready for moving to the new place?
It's going well, thanks to you.
I got your back from now on so let's work as team.
I have this business plan that I might need your help in.
I'm at your service, boss.
I willing to work hard.
But you know it won't be easy settling things with Sang-chul.
I know, boss.
Good.
This case worked out well thanks to you.
- Let's drink to it.
- Yes, boss.
And, one more thing...
This never happened.
Not a soul will find out.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I know, boss.
- So it's ten in total?
- Yeah.
Let's see what you have.
Flush.
Hold your horses.
A full house.
Hey, good timing.
Go get some money.
What is it?
They were meeting together.
The fucking son of a bitch.
He dares to leave me out?
I think Byung-doo did attorney PARK as you said.
I'm sorry it's been so long.
How's your health?
It's just so-so.
I need to cope with it.
Still, you'll get better soon.
Mom, remember how he used to be so considerate.
I told him not to come, but he kept on insisting that he wanted to see you.
Really?
thank you.
I heard you've become a filmmaker?
Yes.
I'm so happy for you.
Poor Byung-doo couldn't finish school because of me.
Mom, you don't need to say that here.
Yeah.
Byung-doo's far better off than I am.
You've got yourself a good son.
You'd better tell some good stories to our director here.
- Got it?
- Yes, boss.
Tell him everything.
Ask them anything you want to know.
Okay.
If you want juicy stuff, ask him.
He's had it rough.
He can stab you while smiling.
Jong-soo boss cried last night watching a TV drama.
You fucking ass, shut up!
Hey, watch it.
We have a guest here.
Sorry boss.
Sorry boss.
Oh, it's OK.
Jong-soo, what is that tattoo of?
It's interesting.
It's a forget-me-not.
Boss waters it sometimes like this
Boss, my tattoo is prettier.
Hong-man's been watching over big boss's gang and says
Young-pil went down to Young-gwang today.
To Young-gwang?
Yeah, he didn't meet anyone in particular.
Just looked around.
Something's fishy.
When's Young-pil going in?
I heard after the big boss's sister's wedding.
Myung-goo, what do you want to do when you climb up in rank.
I want to find a good sponsor and make a fortune.
I wish to buy my own apartment someday.
Myung-goo and Hong-man are petite.
What made you wanna be a gangster?
Why boss, size doesn't matter.
The days of fattening up eating dog food and shit are over.
These days, you can't survive like that.
You need brains and skills these days.
Gangsters need to study to read documents.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, how may I help you?
Byung-doo!
Wow that's a lot of books there.
You read all of it?
Just the titles.
Hey, what happened last time?
You left in the middle of it.
Oh, something came up.
Hey, so how long have you been working here?
- Seven to eight years.
- Oh really?
Your legs must hurt from standing all day.
Well... that's how it is.
So, how's your mother?
She's doing well.
I remember she used to cook red bean noodles for me.
I crave it sometimes.
Wow, you have good memory.
Come over whenever you crave it.
Hey, so you're not dating anyone?
Nope.
And you?
Me?
I was too busy thinking of you.
Yeah right.
I'm serious.
Anyway, it's really nice to see you again.
I know.
Hey, I heard about what you do for living.
What did you hear?
That I'm a gangster?
- Yeah, Young-pil.
- Boss said you get back.
- What?
- He wants to meet you.
- Right now?
- Yes, boss!
- Alright.
- Hurry up.
You know what?
I need to get back to work.
Yeah.
Hey, is it okay if I came by once in a while?
No, why don't you call me when you're around here.
Why?
I don't want my friends to see me at work.
Alright.
- OK, bye.
- Bye.
Come on in.
You asked for me, boss?
Yeah.
Here's the wedding invitation.
Wow, congratulations.
Thanks.
Sit down.
It's sad sending her off.
So have you heard?
Heard what?
Attorney PARK's missing.
Who?
Attorney PARK!
You met him in front of that karaoke.
Cops came by because of that.
Don't know why they're linking me with his absence.
What gangster in his sane mind would do that?
Knowing it would kill the whole organization.
Don't you agree?
Of course, boss.
By the way, go to Young-gwang this weekend after the wedding.
Young-gwang?
Yeah, you remember Mr. JANG?
Go collect money from him.
Yes, boss.
Since that game room didn't work out for you, you can use half of it.
It'll be enough for you and your boys too.
Thanks, boss.
I kind of let you guys drift alone, didn't I?
It's hard with all these boys looking up to me.
I miss those days when we used to rough it together.
Yes, boss.
I want you to tell me if you feel like you're being mistreated.
You're the only one I have left, with Young-pil's going in soon.
He's done attorney PARK
Yeah.
Then you should finish him off and teach Mr. HWANG a lesson.
I don't want to shed blood before the wedding.
He's going after the wedding so go after him and work quietly.
Yes, boss.
This is melting in my mouth.
Boss, you should try some.
- Yeah, you go ahead eat.
- Okay.
This is for you guys.
Where is this from?
Get yourselves a new suit.
Thank you boss!
Let me ask you something.
What is a family?
What does a family mean to you?
Um, a family is like this, like us, boss.
A family is a mouth that eats from the same table.
One mouth, two... three, four five, six... seven, including myself.
We are all one mouth.
- Understood?
- Yes, boss.
Then, what about the asshole that wants to eat alone?
He's not a part of the family.
He's a fucking stranger.
Am I right?
Yes, boss!
Echo waves reach everyone.
A land that split our youth
Life is a turning water mill, so follow the wind and the cloud.
I think the boss knows
Then we should hurry, boss.
It has to be done anyway.
We could get fucked before them if we wait too long
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Boss, nice to see you.
- How are you, boss?
- Ah, welcome.
Congratulations, boss.
Welcome.
Thanks
They said it might rain, but I'm glad it isn't, boss.
Yeah, I know.
You must be missing her already, boss.
Nay, It's about time she got married.
Good!
Everyone, look over here.
One, two!
Thank you.
Pay attention, please.
Would the friends of the groom and the bride come out to take a picture at the front of the aisle.
How's the food?
Thanks for coming.
You did a great job.
Boss.
Yeah.
The car is ready.
Yeah, escort them to the airport
- and drive safely.
- Yes, boss.
Hey, Mr. NOH, come over here.
Man, it's so hard to see you around.
Yeah, long time no see.
Here, sit down.
I need to greet the guests first.
- Have a drink before you go.
- Man, I can't resist.
The groom looks smart.
I heard he's from a good family.
So he's a fair match for my sister.
Of course, boss...
Well, I'm heading off to the airport, so I'll join you when I get back.
It's the least I can do for my boss.
You son of a bitch...
alright.
Okay, see you later.
What the fuck!
Hey!
So how many years are you going in for?
Why don't you take all that money you're managing... and leave the country for a few years?
Boss, you wanna die here or leave?
Hey, you have a drink too.
Hold on.
Boss, it seems there are more guests than expected.
I know.
Hey, nice suit.
Thanks.
It's a special day.
Shouldn't you be getting married soon too?
Not anytime soon, boss.
So when shall I visit Mr. JANG?
Huh?
Oh yeah, go tomorrow.
Mr. JANG isn't going to be easy to collect money from.
That's why appointed you to do the job.
Isn't that yours?
Oh, yes.
I don't know what to do with that gang.
Don't worry boss, I'll handle it.
- Okay.
- Long time no see, boss.
Who are you?
I met you at the funeral last time.
I'm with the Rotary gang, boss.
Oh, you're under Sang-chul.
How are you?
Doing great, boss.
Did you enjoy the food, boss?
Wedding food's always the same.
Then drink as much as you want.
We've prepared enough of it.
I guess Sang-chul boss is doing pretty well.
So many families came.
Sang-chul's always in good terms with everyone.
His boys are pretty smart too.
I heard someone's going in because of the game room.
Young-pil's supposed to go in.
When is he going in?
Right after the wedding, boss.
Is Sang-chul treating your family well too?
Of course, boss.
I see.
Yeah.
Let's finish it.
- Are we set?
- Yup.
- Okay, let's go.
- Yup.
Byung-doo.
I'll go with the driver and start unpacking.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Sun-ok might get lost later so wait for her at the bus stop.
Okay.
Let's go, mom.
Wait a minute.
Let me finish cleaning up.
What are you doing?
You don't need to do that.
Of course I do.
One must clean after his place.
By the way, why are the cops coming for you these days?
Why are you being questioned?
What have you done?
I wish you'd stop living like that and start leading a normal life.
Can you stop.
And don't worry.
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'll find that book for you.
- Yeah.
- Could you come this way?
Here you are.
Would you want me to reserve the other book for you?
Yes, please.
We'll call you when it arrives.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
This is all I could find.
Thanks.
- Who's that?
Your boyfriend?
- No.
He's good looking.
He's not my boyfriend.
Thanks.
- Try this book.
- Okay.
So if I read this, it'll help us with our teamwork?
That's what the title implies.
Sounds nice.
I should buy more of it.
Hey, let's have dinner tonight.
Dinner?
You're buying?
Of course.
You'd better treat me to something delicious.
Miss KANG, what are you doing here?
Customers are waiting.
He's a customer too.
I'll be there soon.
Right now!
You're not eating any more?
I'm full.
I was going to treat you to something fancier.
Why noodles?
I just felt like it.
It's good.
By the way, what was that at the bookstore?
He was an ass.
Oh, don't mind him.
Hey, why did you buy so many books?
They're for my employees.
I have an office now.
What kind of office?
I'm starting a real estate business.
Really?
I heard you're helping Min-ho with his movie.
I'm not much of a help.
I just told him some stories of how we live.
Hyun-joo, do you remember?
Remember what?
How we won first place in the relay race at school?
Yeah, of course I remember.
We used to stay after school to practice.
It was a lot of fun.
We used to go to Min-ho's place for noodles afterwards.
Yeah, we did.
Byung-doo.
Don't get offended by what I'm about to say... but I still can't believe you're doing that for living.
What?
I can't picture you as a gangster knowing how you used to be.
Hyun-joo.
Gangster's just a label.
I'm not as bad as you think.
You'll find out as you see me more often.
I guess Hyun-joo thinks of you a lot, sending you this.
What kind of tree is this?
It doesn't have branches.
Oh, it's a Lucky Tree It rarely blossoms but if it does, something good's supposed to happen.
Hey, I hope it blossoms so you can make a fortune.
Hmm... a Lucky Tree.
Man, she's a woman of wit.
- Hey, Hippo.
- Yes, boss.
Take special care of that.
If you let it die, you die with it.
Yes, boss.
Hey, Byung-doo.
You must've landed a good sponsor.
No, some boss helped me out.
Oh yeah, that boss has a daughter who wants to be an actress.
Can you cast her for your movie?
Why not.
If it's your request, I'll meet her next time.
Do you need help?
You have something chique and comfortable at the same time?
What size does the lady wear?
Try to find one this length.
- I'm sorry?
- This length.
I'm just asking dinner together.
What's the matter?
In front of company?
Let's have a talk.
I said no.
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong with you, huh?
You can't do this to me.
You're not supposed to do this anymore.
Not do what?
Hyun-joo.
Let's start again.
I said I'll try harder.
Does your wife know you're still doing this?
Why are you mentioning her?
This is about us.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Give me my purse.
- Why are you avoiding me?
- Give it back to me.
You can't leave until we're done talking.
- Give it back.
- Let's talk this over.
Hyun-joo.
Hey man, she said she wants to go.
What?
Who is this?
I'm Hyun-joo's friend.
A friend?
So what?
Byung-doo, let's go.
Give me my purse.
Oh... so there was a reason...
All that was for him?
- Hey man.
- Hey man?
Can't you see I have something to discuss with Hyun-joo?
Discuss what?
She said no.
It's okay, let's go.
Hyun-joo.
Wait in my car.
- Go to my car.
- Hey!
What are you doing?
Give me the purse.
Give it to me!
You son of a bitch...
Hey, hold right there!
I said hold right there!
Fucking son of a bitch!
You motherfucker!
Shit!
Hyun-joo!
What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
- Let me go.
What did I do wrong?
Was it that bad what I did?
- What?
- You saw what happened.
He asked for it.
I'm sorry if it scared you.
But I'm not sorry for him.
Don't come to see me anymore.
What?
I don't like gangsters.
So don't come to see me.
What are you saying?
You scare me.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Hey, you can't sit there forever.
Go home now.
I said someone's coming.
Nobody's coming.
Shit, just wait and see.
Hey, Byung-doo, Byung-doo.
Man, you're so fucking heavy.
Why did you drink so much?
- Min-ho!
- What?
Shit!
Why is life so fucking hard?
What are you talking about?
Life sucks.
Hey, you really not gonna eat?
No.
I'm staying over tonight.
It's messy like your place so make yourself at home.
I remember when I used to deliver for your restaurant.
Your mom used to hate seeing you hanging out with me.
Really?
But look at us.
The owner's son and the delivery boy, both pathetic.
Man, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said such a thing.
No, it's okay.
It's true what you said.
Hey, did you find the picture we talked about last time?
The picture?
Yeah.
I was going to give it to you.
Isn't Hyun-joo really cute?
Hey, how are things going between you guys?
- Min-ho, do I scare you too?
- Huh?
Why?
Did someone say you're scary?
No.
I never regretted being a gangster but today,
I feel shitty.
You're really weird today.
Did something happen?
Just thought I shouldn't be doing things I was doing.
tried everything to make money... doing dirty work with sashimi knife.
Still, nothing changed about this shitty life.
I don't know what happened but you're not the only one.
I've been living like this for three years to make a movie.
Hey, did you really use a sashimi knife?
Why?
It sounds so unreal.
May because you're my friend.
When did you get that scar on your shoulder?
This?
You know... when I was fighting over that game room.
Oh... is that scar from a knife?
Yeah.
I wonder what it's like being stabbed.
Have you ever stabbed anyone?
I'm no different from the rest.
What does it feel like?
Stabbing?
Feels like shit.
You're not yourself when you do it.
Yeah.
I can't imagine it.
That's why you shouldn't look into their eyes...
If you do,
it will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Nobody will understand...
I can't get it out of my mind.
Hey, who did you stab?
What's wrong with you today?
This is the bird's eye view of the apartment complex.
The total sales profit will be around 451.8 billion won and the cost of land, construction, and selling...
All those will be replaced by beautiful apartments.
A shopping mall over there and a subway line there.
Imagine the scale of money selling 1,500 units.
We'll get at least five hundred if everything works out well.
Five hundred units?
I can't imagine it, boss.
It could be more.
But it won't be easy driving out the locals.
The landlords probably heard about the development by now.
They'll expect compensation.
There are some defrauders.
You think you can handle it?
Yes, I'll do it, boss.
Good.
If you help me dig those grounds,
I'll give you fifty units.
- Really, boss?
- Of course.
I'm here because of you.
I'll make sure it happens.
Your scenario was good.
Why didn't you do it sooner?
Pardon me?
What happened?
I guess all those interviews paid off.
The characters seemed real and the story's good.
Oh, really?
Let's do it.
- What?
- Let's get the actors together and start tomorrow.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Her beautiful mind mind caressed my heart
Lady, sell it.
Shit, you're holding up our construction business.
Should we come by at night and bury her?
Boss, let's do that.
I know a good mountain for digging.
Things will only get worse.
We'll pay you some extra.
How many times do I need to tell you.
I can't sell it.
I lived here for 30 years and it's all I've got for my sons.
So your second son is a senior in high school?
Excuse me?
Boss, we couldn't find the owners of the five houses.
They're probably hiding.
That 5 area,
I think the Serpents' got them.
I guess they want a part in this too.
The matter's serious if it's the Serpents though.
My boys will find those five landlords soon.
As long as we find one, the rest will come out easy.
Do it quietly.
An all-out war isn't easy.
Yes, boss.
Your guest has arrived.
- Hey, Min-ho.
Come here.
- Hello, director KIM.
Welcome.
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to ask you to come when you must be so busy.
It's no problem.
I heard a lot about you from Byung-doo.
He seems very proud of you.
Really?
How's it coming along?
We'll go into shooting soon.
- First of all, congratulations.
- Thank you.
And thanks for casting my daughter.
She's good for the role.
Plus, Byung-doo helped me so much, it's the least I could do.
It'd better be a big hit.
Thanks.
You can count on me, boss.
Make a blockbuster, Min-ho.
Fighting!
She runs away when I approach her
Looks away when I glance at her
Time keeps passing by while
I wonder if she knows how I feel
She swifts by me, and though I try to ignore it
She flows me like the river She's a rainbow over my heart
I could run, I could fly
If you come into my heart
May I help you?
Do you know where Ms. KANG Hyun-joo is?
She didn't come to work today.
I'm a friend of hers.
Could you give this to her for me?
She's sick, so she's taking some days off.
Really?
Hyun-joo!
Open the door.
I said open the door!
Come out!
Open the door.
You'd better open the door or I'm gonna break in.
Hyun-joo!
Is she okay?
The doctor will be here soon.
Why didn't you call home if you were this sick?
I must say this is excellent although I made it.
I used to get beat to get the recipe right for this.
Try it.
Try just a bite then, for my sake.
Why are you crying?
Eat so you can recover.
What the...
- I'm tired of waiting, Digger
- Digger
- Tired of waiting, Digger
- Digger
I'm so lonely tonight
This is expensive, you know.
100% natural honey...
Man, it's sweet!
It's sweet, ain't it?
There are lots of ants and digger bees in this mountain.
Won't it be nice to see happens for a few days?
Huh?
Where's are they?
Good afternoon, boss.
Did we get everything?
Things got complicated, boss.
Why?
I was just working on those five and it seems Serpent's got the papers himself.
What?
Serpent has them?
Fucking son of a bitch.
What shall we do, boss?
Kill them until they tell you where Serpent is.
Yes, boss.
Who are you?
Mr. KIM, it's not polite to mess with others' business.
Who the fuck are you?
Your mother seemed ill.
Who are you?
And isn't it dangerous after dark for a pretty girl like your sister?
Byung-doo, what's wrong?
What's going on?
Sun-ok, hurry up and pack.
We're leaving right now.
- Mom says she's not going.
- What's happening?
I'll explain later.
Stay at uncle's place for a few days.
- Where's Byung-sik?
- He hasn't come home in a couple of days.
That son of a bitch.
Hurry, what are you doing?
I'm not leaving my house.
What did you do this time?
It's not what you think.
Just listen to me this once.
I can't deal with this anymore.
First it was cops, now we have to hide from gangsters?
We can manage on our own, go hide by yourself.
Your bad example messed up Byung-sik as well.
Shit!
You think I come here because I want to?
Who's gonna take care of Byung-sik and Sun-ok?
Stop shouting at mom.
I won't ask you to take care of us, so get out!
Okay, I'll leave, so do whatever you want.
Where are they, boss?
Call Jong-soo and tell him to send some boys over to my house.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.
We'll take care of them.
Yes, boss.
We'll bury them as soon as we find out where they are.
Okay, boss.
What did the boss say?
To finish everything tonight.
Okay.
Since they love land so much, we'll bury them.
We'll do what they did to our boys, when we find them.
Of course.
Can't believe we're going through all this trouble for Axe.
He shouldn't have got caught by them.
Boss, won't we get something for rescuing all of them?
I'm sure we will as soon as the boss gets things settled.
You know, Axe is a fucking psycho.
Remember when we went to collect money from
Royal Billiards?
Axe forgot to undig him afterwards.
Fuck!
Lighter, lighter.
When we went back the tide water had already reached right below his eyes.
He could've died.
Isn't he a dumb ass, boss?
It gets even better.
When we got there, he looking up at me with these sad pleading eyes.
I was kind of hesitating to kill him.
Then all of a sudden a stream of water shot out of nowhere.
You know what it was?
Eui-jung was pissing on him.
Isn't that something?
He must've been pissing in his pants himself.
I'm sure he was, boss.
All those Mok-po bitches are in the past, boss.
You lying bitch...
What the...
Stop the car!
Fuck!
Fucking, where's Serpent?
Motherfucker!
Stay still, bitch.
Hurry, get him in the car.
This is Serpent's and these are the rest of the landlords'.
The land is open for construction now.
Good job.
You're ruthless.
What about the Serpents?
They're resolved for good?
Of course, boss.
After the authorization, we're set for good.
Don't forget about my share, boss.
Of course, you'll get your share.
- Cut!
- It's a cut.
Everybody, gather here.
What's up with your jump?
It's very different from real life.
I know, boss.
- Hold on.
- Practice!
Everything nice and all, but actions seem too sophisticated
Can't we get it a bit more realistic?
Realistic?
How?
Maybe you can take out that jumping round kick.
You said it was okay on the first round.
You should've said it earlier then.
Now we have to change the whole routine.
This just isn't the type of action I was thinking of...
OK then, no jumping round kick.
What else?
I don't know what you want so tell me specifically.
- Min-ho.
- Yeah.
He's the martial arts choreographer?
Yeah, why?
Hi, I was just watching.
I'm sorry to butt in, but the fight doesn't seem real.
Yes.
Min-ho.
Real gangsters don't fight like this.
Yeah.
Hey, Jong-soo!
Come over here.
Yeah!
- Hurry up.
- Yes, boss.
Stand right here.
You see, a punch should always fly low.
Keep it low and give it a sting at the end.
Like this.
This is how you do it.
I'm fine but the crew seems to feel a bit uncomfortable.
I guess I made a mistake.
I was only trying to help.
I know, but they're all really sensitive right now with stress.
Yeah, then I'll head off.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you soon
When it's all over.
Yeah, good luck with the rest of the shooting.
Min-ho!
Make something with a real Gangster spirit.
See you.
See you.
You're off early today.
Hey, it's been a while.
Yeah, how were you?
You feel better now?
Yeah, I'm much better now.
Good.
Hey, you don't seem happy to see me.
Here, people are watching, hurry, take it.
Actually, I went the book shop several times to see you.
But I couldn't say hi to you.
Thought you'd feel uncomfortable.
But I'm glad you look better.
Oh yeah, thank you for the other day.
You're a good cook.
Yeah, then get sick again.
so I can cook for you again.
How do you like this place?
It's really nice to be out after working inside all day.
It's like another world, another life in there.
I'll take you to a better place next time.
I saw you wearing new shoes.
Does it fit?
How did you know my size?
Just an eye measurement.
I'm always receiving things from you.
What is it?
What's the event?
Nothing.
I just wanted to celebrate something.
Enjoy your cake.
What did you want to celebrate?
You Remember you sent me a Lucky tree?
It blossomed today.
Really?
That's really rare.
Yeah I know, but it did.
If something good really happens, it's because of you.
I had fun today.
Getting some fresh air...
You're a good conversationist, and smiled a lot too today.
You helped me.
I haven't had such a good time in a while.
Really?
Yeah.
Next time, I'm buying.
OK!
Cool.
Won't you invite me for a cup of coffee?
Coffee?
It's too late tonight.
I'll make it for you next time.
Okay.
Man, I can't believe it's time to go already.
Drive safely.
And thanks for the flowers.
Yup.
Hyun-joo, hold on.
Hyun-joo, can I like you?
You still hate me?
No, it's just...
I'm not sure...
Hyun-joo, if you want,
I can quit being a gangster.
To tell you the truth, I've never liked anyone but you.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
The south gangster's struggle
- Congratulations.
Seems like a hit.
- Hey, thanks.
Min-ho.
- You're here.
- You did a great job
Everybody's talking about how good the movie it.
It's good.
It's a good piece of work.
Really?
You must work with me next time then.
Thank you.
- Director!
- Hey, Ji-ae
- Hello, Director.
Hi.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for coming.
Did Ji-ae cause you trouble?
No, she was great.
It was tough for her too.
Director, I think it's a hit.
Everyone's talking about it.
Yeah.
- I wish you best of luck.
- Yes, thank you.
By the way, didn't you invite Byung-doo?
Oh, yes.
I tried calling him, but he wouldn't pick up.
Right, he's so busy these days with work.
I see.
I'll see you after the movie.
Let's have a drink sometime.
Sure.
Have more.
I hope you like it.
It tastes exactly like when I had it in elementary.
I'm glad.
Take some home with you.
She's made plenty.
It's not worth taking home.
Hyun-joo, come over often.
Okay.
A tip for my sister-in-law, it tastes better with salt and sugar.
Hey, you're embarrassing her.
It's my wishful thinking.
Byung-doo, you'd like that too.
You've become a different person ever since you've been dating her.
No I haven't.
Your brother always talks about how pretty and smart you are.
Really?
I'm so happy you're with him.
He has a good heart.
Always bringing all sorts of medicine.
You need to get well soon.
Yes, boss.
Where are you?
I'm having dinner with my family.
- So oblivious...
- Pardon?
Are you alright?
What kind of driving is that?
I'm sorry, I had a small drink...
I'm sorry.
What?
You're driving drunk?
Let me see your license.
I don't have one.
Then let me see your ID.
I don't have that either.
No ID?
What kind of person would drive without a license?
You know who I am?
I sure do.
Hello, attorney Choi!
Long time no see.
Who did you do it to?
Go ahead and tell me.
Min-ho.
I took my boss.
Why?
There must've been a reason for taking him.
You wouldn't do that to your boss for no reason.
You can't tell anyone about this...
How far does he know?
I didn't mention anything about you.
Trust me, boss.
Are you out of your mind?
How could you tell him?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
Why did Sang-chul end up that way?
What will happen if your friend went about telling everyone?
He won't do such a thing, boss.
How can you be sure?
You did it, you clean it up.
Look over here, good.
You're doing well.
Okay, once more.
Now, hold your fists, pose like a gangster.
Smile a little more, a little more, good!
Your characters are very real.
Did you interview real gangsters?
Not, especially.
I watched a lot of gangster movies like THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE.
I usually get inspiration from that movies.
I'm sorry, I should've called you.
Why did you do that?
I trusted you when I told you that.
You shouldn't have done it if you considered me your friend.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, but...
Sorry?
What if this ruins me?
You don't give a fuck, do you?
- Hey, listen to me.
- Listen to what?
I thought hard about it and I figured it would be harmless.
Everyone knows about the case and anyone could've done it.
You've watched it too.
It's not about you.
I made it up.
Think about it.
Kim Min-Ho.
Okay, let's say it was my mistake.
But gangsters can do anything to cover their mistakes.
You wondered what it'd be like being stabbed.
Let me say just one thing... shut up for the rest of your life.
Okay?
Can you do that?
Yes.
I'll take it to my grave.
If something happens, I'm not going down alone, got it?
You trust him?
I don't.
He even made it into a movie.
I said I got it under control.
Stop talking about it.
And start gathering boys for the model house.
If you can't do it because he's your friend, I'll do it.
What?
Leave it up to me.
You son of a bitch, you stay out of this.
What do you mean, Stay out of it, boss?
It's my business so you can stay out of it!
Boss, this isn't just about you.
Our whole family's on the line.
Why are you covering for that fucking bastard?
Will you take care of us, if we all get fucked up?
You son of a bitch!
Son of bitch!
I'll fucking shut you up.
Didn't I say I got it under control, huh?
Don't you ever mention that in front of me again.
Long time no see, boss.
Stop.
Yeah.
Boss, how could you?
Unlike our boss,
I don't know you very well,
Ain't that so you pussy.
Sorry to worry you, boss.
I got everything under control now.
Don't make another mistake.
Yes, boss.
Model house and sales start next week, so be prepared.
Yes, boss.
Our boss saved you this time.
But we'll be watching you.
Better keep your mouth shut.
We're on the same boat now.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your help.
- It's doing well.
- Yes, I'm glad.
What was the competition rate for sales contract until yesterday?
It was 50 to 1 until this morning.
- Boss!
- I knew it would do well.
You did?
Thank you.
We brought more boys.
Really?
Set them over there to lift the atmosphere.
- Okay.
- Okay, boss.
Okay!
Mr. HWANG, the competition is now 70 to 1.
The banks are panicking.
They running out of applications.
Good, keep checking!
Yeah.
Congratulations, boss.
It's a huge success.
You did a lot of work.
Prepare a big feast for the employees tonight.
Let's go in.
Digger!
Hey, Myung-goo!
What is a family?
It's a mouth that eats from the same table.
That's right.
Our family will go all the way!
I can't trust you.
I can't!
I can't!
- You must grow up.
- You must!
You must!
It's no use explaining, but, your heart is good.
Today it's chrysanthemum
Tomorrow it's rose.
You'll fall asleep tired from flirting!
Everybody!
I'm tired of waiting, Digger!
I'm tired of waiting, Digger!
I'm so lonely tonight
Lonely, so lonely
You're a digger, I can't help it
You're a digger, I have to cry.
I'm so lonely tonight.
Lonely, so lonely
I enjoyed your movie.
I was so realistic.
So, why did you call me?
Is something troubling you?
Your little help will be courage poor people.
Let's help poor people.
Let's give them love the end of the year.
Your little help will be courage poor people.
Hey!
Can you come with me?
What is it?
What's the good news?
Tell me.
Not here, come with me.
I'm busy right now.
How about after work?
I can't wait that long.
What is it?
Tell me!
I wanted to say it in a better setting.
Take this first.
What is it?
Open it
- KIM Byung-doo!
- Stay right there!
Move!
Do not let him go!
Catch him!
Move!
Stop!
- Stop!
- Move!
That son of bitch!
Freeze!
Boss, sorry to come by like this.
Jong-gyu, step outside for a while.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry boss.
So what is your plan?
You're gonna hide forever?
I'll clean up the mess since I caused it.
I'll take Min-ho.
What?
I'll finish him and I'll leave the country too.
He's big now.
Things can get more complicated.
I can do it, boss.
Just make sure you give me my share.
It's all my family can depend on.
Just in case, things go wrong, I won't mention your name.
The movie broke the record and sold five million tickets.
Thank you again.
Now let me introduce director KIM Min-ho.
Hello, I'm KIM Min-ho, the director of the movie.
I'm happy to meet all of you.
Thank you for watching our movie.
There were some difficult moments in making this movie, but I never dreamed a day like this would come.
- Yeah, Jong-soo.
- Boss, I just arrived here.
I'll be right there.
Wow, it was crazy going into that theater.
I'm glad we hired those bodyguards.
Thanks, detective!
Why do you look so down?
You should cheer up on a day like this.
Let's have a drink.
Come on, director!
- Let's drink!
- I don't want to ruin this, but I should leave now.
- You can't leave!
- No you can't, director!
What are you talking about?
We're going clubbing after this.
Come on!
I feel ashamed...
Letting you guys down...
I should've listened to you.
That was my biggest mistake.
What good is it to regret the past, boss?
We just need to try solving it.
After this, while I'm gone, you guys live quietly for two years.
And be a good boss to the boys while I'm gone.
Okay, boss.
Boss!
How are you?
Good, what's going on?
They're about to go somewhere else.
Okay.
I'll go ahead, you wait outside.
Be careful, boss.
- Is this on you?
- I told you, everything's on me!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Director, you need to drink with us!
Sang-hee, make him drink.
Drink with me, director.
Let's do a love shot!
Love shot!
Love shot!
Love shot!
Love shot!
There you go, you can drink!
The best manager!
You must be tired.
You must be more tired than me, detective.
I'm used to this, it's my job.
Detective, why don't you have a drink with us too?
Oh no, I'm fine.
I met him when I went to the station.
He's been a lot of help.
Hold on.
- Yes, hello?
- Director, where are you?
Me?
Uh...
Director, where were you?
I was in the men's room.
Come on!
Let's go dance.
No, not me.
You have to go with us.
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go together.
Close all the exits!
We've got Min-ho, boss.
- Really?
Okay.
- Yes, sir.
I'll meet you there.
I'm here.
Where are you?
Who are you?
Got the son of bitch!
Die!
Son of bitch!
Son of bitch!
Boss!
What's going on?
Boss, something went wrong.
Let's clean up.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.
We're nearly there.
What?
What do you mean?
Okay.
- Turn the car around.
- Yes, boss.
Thank you.
I'll see you at the house after the funeral.
Yes, boss.
Okay.
You came...
Go in and call me.
Has Byung-doo called?
Not since his last text message a few days ago...
Really?
Don't worry too much.
He'll come back soon.
Yeah.
Okay, take care.
Bye.
You go ahead drink first.
Yes, sir.
So what is your next movie going to be about?
I haven't decided yet.
How about my past love story?
Excuse me?
You see, I've had a hell of a drama in my love life.
Oh, I see...
Let's meet often to talk about it.
If you like the story, you don't need to worry about the money.
Since you're good at making up stories, I think you'll do it well.
Oh, no... no.
really...
But don't make it too similar, my wife might kill me.
Yup, a fiction will always be a fiction.
Your guest has arrived.
How are you, boss?
- Good.
Come on in.
- Yes.
What are you waiting for?
Bring them in!
I'll bring them right in.
They're important guest, so treat them as you best clients.
Of course.
You know Jong-soo?
Yes.
You know the director?
Yes, boss.
I know him well.
Since you won't be in Seoul for a while, drink up and enjoy.
Thank you, boss.
And congratulations for winning the award.
Yes.
Lets forget the past and start fresh.
Cheers!
This is one of my favorite songs.
The lyrics are good.
Hey, Min-ho.
Make something with a real Gangster spirit.
See you.

ZO In-sung
CHUN Ho-jin
You fucking bastard.
You're a gangster?
You wanna be a gangster, too?
Let go.
Fucking bastard!
Beats up a person and throws away money.
I have to admit he's good for nothing though he's my son.
He needs years behind bars before he comes to his senses.
Stop it already.
We should be thankful they accepted our offer.
By the way, what shall we do?
We only have a month to move out.
Where can we get that much money?
Produced by TCHA Sung-jai KIM Mi-hee / CHOI Sun-joong
I'll find a way.
No, it's okay.
I'll get the money somehow this time.
I'll get the money.
Don't worry, mom.
You wanna get sick again?
This is for Sun-ok's academy and your medication.
Do you still have chest pains?
They're tolerable.
You'd better not be seen with those scamps again.
Next time, I'm gonna break your legs.
- See you.
- Okay.
Drive safely and come by more often.
I think mom's condition's gotten worse these days.
OK.
Here.
A cell phone?
It's not for you to chat and text message with your friends
I can keep it?
Call mom whenever you're late from the academy.
- OK
- Go in.

Oh, KIM Byung-doo?
I know him well.
Really?
How do you know him?
I was in charge ofthe Rotary gang.
I met him then.
How do you know him?
He's my friend from elementary.
Oh, he's your friend?
Yeah.
I've been asking every policeman I met to find him
You should see him then, rather than talking to me
If it's for your movie, you should talk to the gangster himself.
I guess so.
You motherfuckers!
You think you can leave whenever you want?
You think this is some kind a club?
A fucking picnic?
Straighthen up.
I'm home, boss.
Why did you bring them back ifthey didn't wanna be here anymore?
- Jong-soo.
- Yes, boss.
From now on, cut their fingers before they leave.
Yes, boss.
- You, youngest!
- Yes, boss.
- It's tough isn't it?
- No, it's ok, boss.
Let's bear it a little longer.
Since we're already here, might as well go all the way.
- Hey, Hippo!
- Yes, boss.
What's our philosophy?
Yes, boss.
Never lose face, never getjumped on,
Get your shoes polished even if you skip a meal.
Though we may starve to death, we should never fail to respect ourselves
So what do you become the minute you lose integrity?
A scamp.
- Am I right?
- Right, boss.
Let's try our best.
- Let's go working!
- Yes, boss.
Apartment number 108-503!
Bitch, gimme my money!
CHOI Sun-duk, Pay back if you borrowed my money!
Residents of building 108!
My family's starving because apt. 503 won't pay me back!
Who are you calling a bitch!
Honey, call the police!
Go ahead, call again.
Let's go by the fucking law.
You're going a bit too far, young man.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't have any money!
Hello?
Sun-ok?
Byung-doo?
Can you hear me?
Yup.
Got good connection.
What's up?
I forgot to say thank you for the cell phone.
Hey, go back your studying and don't waste your time calling me.
The fruit of patience is what?
It's sweet.
Gotta go, I'm working.
Damn, what are you doing?
Do it harder, make me hard.
Higher, higher.
That's right.
That's right, there.
- Get back to your room.
- Right there.
Good.
I was hurting right there.
Today it's chrysanthemum tomorrow it's rose
You'll fall asleep tired from flirting
I'm tired of waiting Digger Digger
Tired of collecting money Digger Digger
I'm so lonely tonight
Who are you under?
What?
Fucking son of a bitch.
I'm so fucking busy getting ready for my business.
How could I fucking interrupt yours?
What?
Yeah, go ahead!
We're gonna open as planned.
Do whatever you want!
Bring your axe and shit!
Shit!
- Hey!
- Yes, boss.
Hey, why did you make it so noticeable?
Sorry, boss.
I tried my best.
We might as well clean them up for good this time, boss!
Leave it.
Don't make things big.
Take care of it at your level.
Yes, boss.
Later, boss.
Boss, is everything okay?
Yeah, the game room...
- So you got it?
- Yes, boss.
Good.
Here, this is for you.
Boss, give us a bit more.
Hey, times are difficult for me too.
Getting my only sister married costs a shit load.
A bit more, boss.
We can't even pay rent these days.
Dumb ass!
Getting cheated by your own sponsor...
Let's wait 'til things get better.
You said that before, boss.
What!
Boss, can't you just pretend you skipped a racecourse bet?
You fucking with me?
How dare you fuck with me...
Byung-doo, how old are you this year?
Twenty-nine, boss.
Twenty-nine, huh?
And look at yourself.
Still begging for money...
Shouldn't you be getting somewhere by now?
Six villas and 20% a month.
Get them notarized...
Why waste money?
We are the notary.
Then make sure you get all the right documents.
Right, boss.
How are you, boss!
Yes, Byung-doo!
Heard you did a greatjob.
It's nothing.
No, no, that wasn't easy money to get back.
Sang-chul's got a smart kid under him.
All my boys are smart, boss.
Byung-doo, we're about to go for a drink.
Join us.
- Don't mind me.
- Come along.
You can be boss's designated driver.
I like you cause you don't look like a gangster.
Gangsters need to look like this nowadays.
It's hard to do business looking like him.
Boss, I've been getting facials.
Byung-doo, got a sponsor?
No, boss.
Not anymore.
Things didn't work out, boss.
His sponsor flew with our investment money.
It's hell of a situation, boss.
Then why don't you let him manage the new game room?
Yes, boss.
I was thinking about that.
I love you, boss.
Oh my god oh my god don't do this to me
A girl's heart is like a reed
Don't do this Don't ask
Don't ask any more
Hello.
Yes, I'm having a drink with some employees.
Uh?
I'm afraid I can't right now.
Yes, I know.
Yes, give me some more time.
I'm sorry.
I can't believe I love you
Though you're not...
Fucking asshole!
What a pain in the ass.
But try to work things out.
- Sang-chul.
- Yes, boss.
Why don't you take attorney PARK for me?
What?
Couldn't you quietly solve this situation?
What do you mean?
I can't sleep well knowing he's pulling my strings.
If you do it for me, got your back for the rest of your life.
Can you do it?
Boss, we'll all get fucked.
You know that boss.
I'll do anything, but an attorney...
It's a different matter.
Right.
I knew it'd be hard.
Glory Game Land
Boss.
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks for coming.
You're raking in money.
Rake in my ass.
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.
Heard you're gonna be in charge ofthis place.
- Yes.
-Good luck, boy.
It's a good location, all it needs is a good management.
This is just the beginning.
Soon, we'll own several ofthese.
We need to get a good sponsor and start making a fortune.
By the way boss, we're gonna have some trouble with the Three-way gang.
This is their district, isn't it?
Hey, I'm going for a drink with the guests.
I'll be back soon.
- Okay, boss.
- Ok.
- Jong-soo, gimme some light.
- Yes, boss.
You've come a long way smoking in front of me.
It's a special day, boss.
Let me smoke just this one.
So you like driving that BMW?
You know it's not my car.
Son of a bitch!
Stop going around kissing boss's ass and act right.
What?
I heard you've been making trouble at Three-way's game room.
Are you going to fight them alone ifthey gain up on us?
What are you scared about?
It needs to happen anyway.
Hey, this business is mine.
Don't you butt in.
Byung-doo!
Hey, Min-ho!
KIM Min-ho!
Hey, long time no see.
Yeah, it's been a while.
How long has it been, man?
I know.
It's been ages.
Hey, you still look the same.
You too, man.
I could spot you out in an instant.
Oh yeah?
So why is it so hard to see you?
I looked up everywhere to find you.
Oh yeah?
Detective WOO called this morning.
He says you're a filmmaker?
I'm working on something.
Man, it's so cool I have a friend who's a film director.
What about you Byung-doo?
How's work?
I'm running that place and doing this and that.
Heard you wanted to meet gangsters?
Yeah, I'm preparing a gangster movie.
I met some detectives
Now I need to meet some gangsters.
I don't know if it'll help.
They're just like normal people.
Still...
I need to learn about their world.
Hey, are you still keeping in touch with elementary friends?
Sure, I see them once in a while at the reunion events.
Then have you seen KANG Hyun-joo?
KANG Hyun-joo?
Yeah, I saw her at the last gathering.
You remember her?
I remember my close friends.
So, how is she doing?
I heard she works at a book store.
Yeah, Jong-soo.
what?
Son of a bitch!
You motherfucker.
Son of a bitch!
Fucking motherfuckers.
Come in all of you!
- Young-pil!
- Yes, boss.
- Call the Three-way fucks.
- Yes, boss.
- Byung-doo!
- Yes, boss.
It's war.
Gather all the boys.
Yes, boss.
Young-pil...
where are you?
What?
Stuck in traffic?
We're nearly there so get here as soon as you can!
Shit, run them over!
Motherfuckers.
Open the trunk!
Shit
Son of a bitch.
Die!
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Motherfuckers!
Boss!
What was he thinking?
Big boss made things messy gutting that boy for nothing
Boss, isn't our whole family in deep shit if he dies?
Shut up!
Let's wait 'til the boss gets things settled
Big boss'd better not forget us, after everything we did this time.
Yeah, Sun-ok.
What?
!
Why on earth would you join the demonstration?
You have any idea how dangerous they are?
You thought they'd build around our house if you protested?
What else could I do?
By the way, what happened to your face?
Were you in a fight again?
Never mind my face.
You and Byung-sik, both of you...
It's all my fault.
Don't use your fists anymore.
Wars are outdated now.
You have to use your brains, Not your sashimi knives.
Yes, boss.
So how did you settle it?
We paid some compensation and Young-pil is going in.
- Young-pil is?
- Yes, boss.
I asked him to do it for me.
So I let his boys take care ofthe game room.
Boss, what do you mean?
I had to do it.
It was the least I could do for him.
Boss...
Sir, attorney PARK wants to see you in the next room.
Attorney PARK's here?
Who told him I was here?
Did I make a mistake?
What shall I tell him?
Tell him I'll be there.
This asshole is a stumbling block in my life.
Boss, just have a drink with him.
Go to boss's car and wait.
Boss, can I talk to you?
What is it?
How can you do this to me?
You need to understand.
Boss, did I ever disobey you?
What is it that Young-pil did that I didn't do for you?
I know.
Next time, OK?
Boss, please just this once.
Our family is about to get thrown out to the streets.
Please reconsider, boss.
Then you wanna go in instead ofYoung-pil?
- See you again.
- Yeah, see you next time.
- Is boss's car ready?
- Yes, boss.
- Hey!
- Yes?
- That's this?
- Oh, he's with me.
Meet attorney PARK.
He's a gangster too then.
Hey, come over here.
Fucking gangsters...
Parasites of our society...
Loser like this should be all sucked up with a vacuum cleaner.
Why don't you leave the poor kid alone.
Hey, Myung-geun.
You're neither a civilian nor a gangster.
What are you?
A mutt?
Act straight.
Let's have a smoke.
People need to age gracefully.
Attorneys aren't easy.
How old are you?
Twenty-nine, boss.
That's when Sang-chul came.
He was quick back then.
He's come a long way...
or maybe went too far.
There's so much to do but it's hard to find someone who'll last.
You should find a good sponsor and start making real money.
You can't be a gangster forever.
Thanks for your advice, boss.
Byung-doo, you just need to know two things to be successful.
Who you need, and what he needs...
It seems Sang-chul doesn't need anything anymore.
Thanks for driving.
Good night, boss.
Think of me as your big brother.
Yes.
Go home now.
Good night.
Sorry for coming back, boss.
It's okay.
What is it?
Do you have... a name card ofthat attorney?
This is serious stuff.
All our necks are on the line.
You don't have to join me.
I'll do it myself if you're not in.
How can you say such a thing.
We're both outsiders, starting out as club waiters...
When will we make our fortune living like this?
Do you think we can ever find another sponsor like this?
Jong-soo!
Yes, boss.
Trust me on this one.
Yes, boss.
I'm here because of you.
I'll go if you go.
Good.
Let's go for it.
See if you can find out anything.
Work quietly.
Mr. CHOI!
How are you?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I was waiting for you but you didn't come...
Right, we had an appointment.
Sorry, I forgot.
It's not a problem.
But, can I talk to you for a minute?
Right now?
I can't.
I have a meeting.
How about tomorrow?
See you tomorrow.
Then, have you read my scenario?
Your scenario?
Why don't you look for something else?
The story hasn't changed a bit since last time.
If it's a gangster movie, it needs something strong.
but this one...
the storyline's just bland.
Plus, there's no gangster in this gangster movie.
Look for something else.
Sir.
I'll change it...
one last time.
I'm doing real interviews with some gangsters right now.
I'll make it realistic this time.
You just wait, motherfuckers.
I'll make something huge.
Hey, you found this place.
Yeah, it wasn't hard.
What's up with you these days?
I couldn't get a hold of you...
Are you busy these days?
Yeah, the business is busy.
I'm sorry about the other day.
Things just happen and shit...
Yeah, I saw what happened.
Man, what was that fight over?
You saw?
Just the usual territory fight.
Ah!
Man, that was some action.
It's my first time seeing gangsters fight.
Did you get hurt or anything?
I'm fine.
So what is it that you had to see me so urgently
Oh, that...
I'll tell you as we go.
Go where?
Where are we going?
You'll see once we get there.
Where are you taking me...
It was such a spectacle when the fat boy got smashed.
We couldn't go that way since then thanks to this son of a bitch.
That's right.
Byung-doo, you used to be so athletic.
Don't you remember?
Our class won that relay run because of him.
Yeah, that's right.
Man, it's so good to see you again.
I know.
Yeah, come out more often.
Yeah, okay.
Help Min-ho with his film too.
It's about time he made something.
Hey, stop.
Who knows?
When he becomes famous maybe he'll bring some gorgeous actresses with him.
As if I'll have time for you guys.
You arrogant son of a bitch.
Whatever!
Hey, Min-ho,
I think I'd better go in now.
Why?
Stay a little longer.
Hyun-joo will come soon.
This prick bought it.
I guess he did.
It's a bet!
He's betting two hundred for whoever finished
- the pie in 20 seconds.
- Really?
20 seconds?
Anyone can do that!
Whoever eats it can take it.
You'd better keep your word.
- OK, Two hundred!
- You guys, join us.
Alright, bring on the pie.
- Byung-doo, try it.
- Hey, let's do it.
One, two, start!
Stop!
Who's finished it?
For real?
Open your mouth.
What the...
Byung-doo, take it.
Use it to pay for the drinks.
Hey, Hyun-joo!
Sorry, sorry.
Come sit over here.
Why are you so late?
Work ended late today.
You're always late.
- You'd better pay penalty.
- Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You know how long Byung-doo waited for you?
Hey, Byung-doo.
Hey, it's been a long time.
It's so good to see you.
You still look the same.
Really?
What do you mean?
She's aged.
You wanna die?
So when are you going to get married, Hyun-joo?
Hey, ask me after you find me a man first.
Hey, you know how much Byung-doo missed you?
Really?
Hey, I never said that.
Why not?
I missed him too.
She runs away when I approach her
Looks away when I glance at her
Time keeps passing by while
I wonder if she knows how I feel
She swifts by me and though I try to ignore it
Aren't you glad you came today?
Let's see each other more often.
You know how much I missed you?
Min-ho, today's just perfect.
Yeah...
I may not chase the butterfly but I'll stay by you forever
And flow by you like the river
I could run I could fly
If you came into my heart
Okay.
Hyun-joo.
You rock.
I could run I could fly
Drive safely, I'll call again.
Not too close.
Run in.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Hey, what the hell is wrong with your driving?
I'm sorry.
I must've dozed off.
Don't you know any better not to drive when you're sleepy?
I'm sorry.
I'll pay for the damage.
- Let me get your name card.
- Yes, sure.
Aren't you attorney PARK?
You know me?
Yeah, I'm OH Jong-soo.
Don't you remember me?
OH Jong-soo?
Have we met before?
I saw you at the Rainbow.
Why don't you eat some food as well.
The food here is really good.
Yes, boss.
You look healthier than before.
Really?
I'm working out more, running two extra kilometers.
I must live long enough to spend all that money I have.
Of course, boss.
How's getting ready for moving to the new place?
It's going well, thanks to you.
I got your back from now on so let's work as team.
I have this business plan that I might need your help in.
I'm at your service, boss.
I willing to work hard.
But you know... it wont' be easy settling things with Sang-chul.
I know, boss.
Good.
This case worked out well thanks to you.
- Let's drink to it.
- Yes, boss.
And, one more thing...
This never happened.
Not a soul will find out.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I know, boss.
So it's ten in total?
Let's see what you have.
Flush.
Hold your horses.
A full house.
Hey, good timing.
Go get some money.
They were meeting together.
The fucking son of a bitch.
He dares to leave me out?
I think Byung-doo did attorney PARK as you said.
I'm sorry it's been so long.
How's your health?
It's just so-so.
I need to cope with it.
Still, you'll get better soon.
Mom, remember how he used to be so considerate.
I told him not to come, but he kept on insisting that he wanted to see you.
Really?
thank you.
I heard you've become a filmmaker?
Yes.
I'm so happy for you.
Poor Byung-doo couldn't finish school because of me.
Mom, you don't need to say that here.
Byung-doo's far better offthan I am.
You've got yourself a good son.
You'd better tell some good stories to our director here.
Yes, boss.
Tell him everything.
Ask them anything you want to know.
Okay.
If you wantjuicy stuff, ask him.
He's had it rough.
He can stab you while smiling.
Jong-soo boss cried last night watching a TV drama.
You fucking ass, shut up!
Hey, watch it.
We have a guest here.
Sorry boss.
Oh, it's ok.
Jong-soo, what is that tattoo of?
It's interesting.
It's a forget-me-not.
Boss waters it sometimes like this...
Boss, my tattoo is prettier.
Hong-man's been watching over big boss's gang and says
Young-pil went down to Young-gwang today.
To Young-gwang?
Yeah, he didn't meet anyone in particular.
Just looked around.
Something's fishy.
When's Young-pil going in?
I heard after the big boss's sister's wedding.
Myung-goo, what do you want to do when you climb up in rank.
I want to find a good sponsor and make a fortune.
I wish to buy my own apartment someday.
Myung-goo and Hong-man are petite.
What made you wanna be a gangster?
Why boss, size dosen't matter.
The days offattening up eating dog food and shit are over.
These days, you can't survive like that.
You need brains and skills these days.
Gangsters need to study to read documents.
Excuse me.
- Yes, how may I help you?
Byung-doo!
Wow that's a lot of books there.
You read all of it?
Just the titles.
Hey, what happened last time?
You left in the middle of it.
Oh, something came up.
Hey, so how long have you been working here?
7-8 years.
Oh really?
Your legs must hurt from standing all day.
Well, that's how it is.
So, how's your mother?
She's doing well.
I remember she used to cook red bean noodles for me.
I crave it sometimes.
You have good memory.
Come over whenever you crave it.
Hey, so you're not dating anyone?
Nope.
And you?
Me?
I was too busy thinking of you.
Yeah right.
I'm serious.
Anyway, it's really nice to see you again.
Yeah.
Hey, I heard about what you do for living.
What did you hear?
That I'm a gangster?
- Yeah, Young-pil.
- Boss wants to see you.
- What?
- He said right now.
- Right now?
- Yes, boss.
- I see.
- Hurry up.
Alright.
You know what?
I need to get back to work.
Yeah.
Hey, is it okay if I came by once in a while?
No, why don't you call me when you're around here.
Why?
I don't want my friends to see me at work.
Alright.
- OK, bye.
- Bye.
- Come on in.
- You asked for me, boss?
Here's the wedding invitation.
Wow.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Sit down.
It's sad sending her off.
- So have you heard?
- Heard what?
Attorney PARK's missing.
Who?
Attorney PARK!
You met him in front ofthat karaoke.
Cops came by because ofthat.
Don't know why they're linking me with his absence.
What gangster in his sane mind would do that?
Knowing it would kill the whole organization.
Don't you agree?
Of course, boss.
By the way, go to Young-gwang this weekend after the wedding.
Young-gwang?
Do you remember Mr. JANG?
Go collect money from him.
Yes, boss.
Since that game room didn't work out for you, you can use half of it.
It'll be enough for you and your boys too.
Thanks, boss.
I kind of let you guys drift alone, didn't I?
It's hard with all these boys looking up to me.
I miss those days when we used to drought it together.
Yes, boss.
I want you to tell me if you feel like you're being mistreated.
You're the only one I have left, with Young-pil's going in soon.
He's done attorney PARK
Yes.
Then you should finish him off and teach Mr. HWANG a lesson.
I don't want to shed blood before the wedding.
He's going after the wedding so go after him and work quietly
Yes, boss.
This is melting in my mouth.
Boss, you should try some.
- Yeah, you go ahead eat.
- Okay.
This is for you guys.
Where is this from?
Get yourselves a new suit.
Thank you boss!
Let me ask you something.
What is a family?
What does a family mean to you?
Um, a family is like this, like us, boss.
A family is a mouth that eats from the same table.
One mouth, two... three, four... five, six... seven including myself
We are all one mouth.
- Understood?
- Yes, boss.
Then, what about the asshole that wants to eat alone?
He's not a part ofthe family.
He's a fucking stranger.
Am I right?
Yes, boss!
Echo waves reach everyone
A land that split our youth
Life is a turning water mill so follow the wind and the cloud
I think the boss knows.
Then we should hurry, boss.
It has to be done anyway.
We could get fucked before them ifwe wait too long.
Thank you.
Boss, nice to see you.
- How are you, boss?
- Ah, welcome.
- Congratulations, boss.
- Welcome.
Thanks.
They said it might rain, but I'm glad it isn't, boss.
Yeah, I know.
You must be missing her already, boss.
It's about time she got married.
Everyone, look over here.
One, two...
Thank you.
Would the friends ofthe groom and the bride come out to take a picture at the front ofthe aisle.
How's the food?
Thanks a lot!
- Boss.
- Yeah.
The car is ready.
Yeah, escort them to the airport
- and drive safely.
- Yes, boss.
Hey, Mr. NOH, come over here.
Man, it's so hard to see you around.
Yeah, long time no see.
Here, sit down.
I need to greet the guests first.
- Have a drink before you go.
- Man, I can't resist.
The groom looks smart.
I heard he's from a good family.
So he's a fair match for my sister.
Of course, boss...
Well, I'm heading off to the airport, so I'll join you when I get back.
It's the least I can do for my boss.
You son of a bitch.
Alright.
Okay, see you later.
So how many years are you going in for?
Why don't you take all that money you're managing... and leave the country for a few years?
Boss, you wanna die here or leave?
Hey, you have a drink too.
Hold on.
Boss, it seems there are more guests than expected.
I know.
Hey, nice suit.
Thanks.
It's a special day.
Shouldn't you be getting married soon too?
Not anytime soon, boss.
So when shall I visit Mr. JANG?
Huh?
Oh yeah, go tomorrow.
Mr. JANG isn't going to be easy to collect money from.
That's why appointed you to do the job.
Isn't that yours?
Oh, yes.
I don't know what to do with that gang.
Don't worry boss, I'll handle it.
- Okay.
- Long time no see, boss.
Who are you?
I met you at the funeral last time.
I'm with the Rotary gang, boss.
Oh, you're under Sang-chul.
How are you?
Doing great, boss.
Did you enjoy the food, boss?
Wedding food's always the same.
Then drink as much as you want.
We've prepared enough of it.
I guess Sang-chul boss is doing pretty well.
So many families came.
Sang-chul's always in good terms with everyone.
His boys are pretty smart too.
I heard someone's going in because ofthe game room.
Young-pil's supposed to go in.
When is he going in?
Right after the wedding, boss.
Is Sang-chul treating your family well too?
Of course, boss.
I see.
Yeah.
Good.
Let's finish it.
- Are we set?
- Yup.
- Okay, let's go.
- Yup.
I'll go with the driver and start unpacking.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Sun-ok might get lost later so wait for her at the bus stop.
Okay.
Let's go, mom.
Wait a minute.
Let me finish cleaning up.
You don't need to do that.
Of course I do.
One must clean after his place.
By the way, why are the cops coming for you these days?
Why are you being questioned?
What have you done?
I wish you'd stop living like that and start leading a normal life.
Can you stop.
And don't worry.
I'm not doing anything bad.
I'll find that book for you.
Could you come this way?
It's your book!
Would you want me to reserve the other book for you?
Yes, please.
We'll call you when it arrives.
Thank you.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
- This is all I could find.
- Thanks.
- Your boyfriend?
- No.
- He's good looking.
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
- Try this book.
- Okay.
So if I read this, it'll help us with our teamwork?
That's what the title implies.
Sounds nice.
I should buy more of it.
Hey, let's have dinner tonight.
Dinner?
- You're buying?
- Of course.
You'd better treat me to something delicious.
Miss KANG, what are you doing here?
Customers are waiting.
He's a customer too.
I'll be there soon.
Right now!
You're not eating any more?
I'm full.
I was going to treat you to something fancier.
Why noodles?
I just felt like it.
It's good.
By the way, what was that at the bookstore?
He was an ass.
Don't mind him.
Hey, why did you buy so many books?
They're for my employees.
I have an office now.
What kind of office?
I'm starting a real estate business.
Really?
I heard you're helping Min-ho with his movie.
I'm not much of a help.
I just told him some stories of how we live.
Hyun-joo, do you remember?
Remember what?
How we won first place in the relay race at school?
Yeah, of course I remember.
We used to stay after school to practice.
It was a lot offun.
Yeah
We used to go to Min-ho's place for noodles afterwards.
Yeah, we did.
Byung-doo.
Don't get offended by what I'm about to say... but I still can't believe you're doing that for living.
What?
I can't picture you as a gangster knowing how you used to be.
Hyun-joo.
Gangster's just a label.
I'm not as bad as you think.
You'll find out as you see me more often.
I guess Hyun-joo thinks of you a lot, sending you this.
What kind oftree is this?
It doesn't have branches.
It's a Lucky Tree.
It rarely blossoms but if it does, something good's supposed to happen.
I hope it blossoms so you can make a fortune.
A Lucky Tree.
Man, she's a woman ofwit.
- Hey, Hippo.
- Yes, boss.
Take special care ofthat.
If you let it die, you die with it.
Yes, boss.
Hey, Byung-doo.
You must've landed a good sponsor.
No, some boss helped me out.
Oh yeah, that boss has a daughter who wants to be an actress.
Can you cast her for your movie?
Why not.
If it's your request,
I'll meet her next time.
Do you need help?
You have something schique and comfortable at the same time?
What size does the lady wear?
Try to find one this length.
- I'm sorry?
- This length.
Let's have a talk with dinner.
Why not?
Here are in front of company.
Let's have a talk.
I said no.
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong with you?
You can't do this to me.
You're not supposed to do this anymore.
Not do what?
Hyun-joo, let's start again.
I said I'll try harder.
Does your wife know you're still doing this?
Why are you mentioning her?
This is about us.
I don't want to talk with you.
Give me my purse.
Why are you avoiding me?
Give it back to me.
You can't leave until we're done talking.
Give it back.
- Let's talk this over.
- Hyun-joo.
Hey man, she said she wants to go.
What?
Who is this?
I'm Hyun-joo's friend.
A friend?
So what?
Byung-doo, let's go.
Give me my purse.
Oh... so there was a reason...
All that was for him?
- Hey man.
- Hey man?
Can't you see I have something to discuss with Hyun-joo?
Discuss what?
She said no.
It's okay, let's go.
Hyun-joo.
Wait in my car.
Go to my car.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Give me the purse.
Give it to me!
You son of a bitch...
Hey, hold right there!
I said hold right there!
Fucking son of a bitch!
You motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!
What's wrong?
- Let me go.
- What did I do wrong?
- Was it that bad what I did?
- What?
You saw what happened.
He asked for it.
I'm sorry if it scared you.
But I'm not sorry for him.
Don't come to see me anymore.
What?
I don't like gangsters.
So don't come to see me.
What are you saying?
You scare me.
I don't want to see you anymore.
Hey, you can't sit there forever.
Go home now.
I said someone's coming.
Nobody's coming.
Shit, just wait and see.
Hey, Byung-doo, Byung-doo.
Man, you're so fucking heavy.
Why did you drink so much?
- Min-ho...
- What?
Shit...
Why is life so fucking hard?
What are you talking about?
Life sucks.
Hey, you really not gonna eat?
No.
I'm staying over tonight.
It's messy like your place so make yourself at home.
I remember when I used to deliver for your restaurant.
Your mom used to hate seeing you hanging out with me.
Really?
The owner's son and the delivery boy, both pathetic.
Man, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said such a thing.
No, it's okay.
It's true what you said.
Did you find the picture we talked about last time?
The picture?
Yeah.
I was going to give it to you.
Isn't Hyun-joo really cute?
Hey, how are things going between you guys?
Min-ho, do I scare you too?
Why?
Did someone say you're scary?
I...
I never regretted being a gangster but today,
I feel shitty.
You're really weird today.
Did something happen?
Just thought I shouldn't be doing things I was doing.
I tried everything to make money... doing dirty work with sashimi knife.
Still, nothing changed about this shitty life.
I don't know what happened but you're not the only one.
I've been living like this for 3 years to make a movie.
Hey, did you really use a sashimi knife?
Why?
It sounds so unreal.
May because you're my friend.
When did you get that scar on your shoulder?
This?
You know... when I was fighting over that game room.
Ah...
Is that scar from a knife?
Yeah.
I wonder what it's like being stabbed.
Have you ever stabbed anyone?
I'm no different from the rest.
What does it feel like?
Stabbing?
Feels like shit.
You're not yourselfwhen you do it.
Yeah.
I can't imagine it.
That's why you shouldn't look into their eyes...
If you do, it will haunt you
for the rest of your life.
Nobody will understand...
I can't get it out of my mind.
Hey, who did you stab?
What's wrong with you today?
This is the bird's eye view ofthe apartment complex.
The total sales profit will be around 451 .8 billion won and the cost of land, construction, and selling...
All those will be replaced by beautiful apartments.
A shopping mall over there and a subway line there.
Imagine the scale of money selling 1 ,500 units.
We'll get at least five hundred if everything works out well.
Five hundred units?
I can't imagine it, boss.
It could be more.
But it won't be easy driving out the locals.
The landlords probably heard about the development by now.
They'll expect compensation.
You think you can handle it?
Yes, I'll do it, boss.
Good.
If you help me dig those grounds,
I'll give you 50 units.
- Really, boss?
- Of course.
I'm here because of you.
I'll make sure it happens.
Your scenario was good.
Why didn't you do it sooner?
Pardon me?
I guess all those interviews paid off.
The characters seemed real and the story's good.
Oh, really?
- Let's do it.
- What?
Let's get the actors together and start tomorrow.
Ah, yeah.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Her beautiful smile
Her beautiful mind caressed my heart
Lady, sell it.
Shit, you're holding up our construction business.
Should we come by at night and bury her?
Boss, let's do that.
I know a good mountain for digging.
Things will only get worse.
We'll pay you some extra.
How many times do I need to tell you.
I can't sell it.
I lived here for 30 years and it's all I've got for my sons
So your second son is a senior in high school?
Excuse me?
Boss, we couldn't find the owners ofthe five houses.
They're probably hiding.
I think the Serpents' got them.
I guess they want a part in this too.
The matter's serious if it's the Serpents though.
My boys will find those five landlords soon.
As long as we find one, the rest will come out easy.
Do it quietly.
An all-out war isn't easy.
- Yes, boss.
- Your guest has arrived.
- Hey, Min-ho.
Come here.
- Hello, director KIM.
Welcome.
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to ask you to come when you must be so busy.
It's no problem.
I heard a lot about you from Byung-doo.
He seems very proud of you.
Really?
How's it coming along?
We'll go into shooting soon.
First of all, congratulations.
And thanks for casting my daughter.
She's good for the role.
Byung-doo helped me it's the least I could do.
It'd better be a big hit.
Thanks.
You can count on me, boss.
Make a blockbuster, Min-ho.
She runs away when I approach her
Looks away when I glance at her
Time keeps passing by while
I wonder if she knows how I feel
She swifts by me and though I try to ignore it
She flows me like the river
She's a rainbow over my heart
I could run I could fly
If you come into my heart
May I help you?
Do you know where Ms. KANG Hyun-joo is?
She didn't come to work today.
I'm a friend of hers.
Could you give this to her for me?
She's sick, so she's taking some days off.
Really?
Hyun-joo!
Open the door.
I said open the door!
Come out!
Open the door.
You'd better open the door.
I'm gonna break in.
Hyun-joo!
Is she okay?
The doctor will be here soon.
Why didn't you call home if you were this sick?
I must say this is excellent although I made it.
I used to get beat to get the recipe right for this.
Try it.
Tryjust a bite then, for my sake.
Why are you crying?
Eat so you can recover.
What the...?
I'm tired of waiting Digger Digger
Tired of waiting Digger Digger
I'm so lonely tonight
This is expensive, you know.
100% natural honey...
Man, it's sweet!
It's sweet, ain't it?
There are lots of ants and digger bees in this mountain.
Won't it be nice to see happens for a few days?
Where's are they?
Did we get everything?
Things got complicated, boss.
Why?
I was just working on those five and it seems Serpent's got the papers himself.
What?
Serpent has them?
Fucking son of a bitch.
What shall we do, boss?
Kill them, until they tell you where Serpent is.
Yes, boss.
Who are you?
Mr. KIM, it's not polite to mess with others' business.
Who the fuck are you?
Your mother seemed ill.
Who are you?
And isn't it dangerous after dark for a pretty girl like your sister?
Byung-doo, what's wrong?
What's going on?
Sun-ok, hurry up and pack.
We're leaving right now.
Mom says she's not going.
What's happening?
Stay at uncle's place for a few days.
Where's Byung-sik?
He hasn't come home in a couple of days.
That son of a bitch.
Hurry, what are you doing?
I'm not leaving my house.
What did you do this time?
Just listen to me this once.
I can't deal with this anymore.
First it was cops, now we have to hide from gangsters?
We can manage on our own, go hide by yourself.
Your bad example messed up Byung-sik as well.
Shit!
You think I come here because I want to?
Who's gonna take care of Byung-sik and Sun-ok?
Stop shouting at mom.
I won't ask you to take care of us.
So get out!
Okay, I'll leave
So do whatever you want.
Where are they, boss?
Call Jong-soo and tell him to send some boys over to my house.
Yes, boss.
Yes!
We'll take care ofthem.
We'll bury them as soon as we find out where they are.
Okay, boss.
What did the boss say?
To finish everything tonight.
Okay.
Since they love land so much, we'll bury them.
We'll do what they did to our boys, when we find them.
Of course.
Can't believe we're going through all this trouble for Axe.
He shouldn't have got caught by them.
Boss, won't we get something for rescuing all ofthem?
I'm sure we will as soon as the boss gets things settled.
You know, Axe is a fucking psycho.
Remember when we went to collect money from Royal Billiards?
Axe forgot to bury him afterwards.
Lighter, lighter.
When we went back the tide water had already reached right below his eyes.
He could've died.
Isn't he a dumb ass, boss?
It gets even better.
When we got there, he looking up at me with these sad pleading eyes.
Then all of a sudden a stream of water shot out of nowhere.
You know what it was?
Eui-jung was pissing on him.
Isn't that something?
He must've been pissing in his pants himself.
I'm sure he was, boss.
All those Mokpo bitches are in the past, boss.
You lying bitch...
What?
What the...
Stop the car!
Motherfucker!
Where's Serpent?
Stay still, bitch.
Hurry, get him in the car.
This is Serpent's.
These are the rest ofthe landlords.
The land is open for construction now.
Good job.
You're ruthless.
What about the Serpents?
They're resolved for good?
Of course, boss.
After the authorization, we're set for good.
Don't forget about my share, boss.
Of course, you'll get your share.
- Cut
- It's a cut.
It's very different from real life...
I know, boss.
Practice!
Everything nice and all, but actions seem too sophisticated.
Can't we get it a bit more realistic?
Realistic?
How?
Maybe you can take out thatjumping round kick.
You said it was okay on the first round.
You should've said it earlier then.
Now we have to change the whole routine.
This just isn't the type of action I was thinking of...
OK then, no jumping round kick.
What else?
I don't know what you want so tell me specifically.
- Min-ho.
- Yes.
He's the martial arts choreographer?
Yeah, why?
Hi, I was just watching.
I'm sorry to butt in, but the fight doesn't seem real.
Min-ho, real gangsters don't fight like this.
Hey, Jong-soo!
Come over here.
- Hurry up.
- Yes, boss.
Stand right here.
You see.
A punch should always fly low.
Keep it low and give it a sting at the end.
Like this.
This is how you do it.
I'm fine but the crew seems to feel a bit uncomfortable.
I guess I made a mistake.
I was only trying to help.
I know.
They're all really sensitive right now with stress.
Yeah, then I'll head off.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you soon
When it's all over.
Yeah, good luck with the rest ofthe shooting.
Min-ho!
Make something with a real Gangster spirit.
See you.
You're off early today.
It's been a while.
How were you?
You feel better now?
I'm much better now.
Good.
You don't seem happy to see me.
People are watching, hurry, take it.
Actually, I went the book shop several times to see you.
But I couldn't say hi to you.
Thought you'd feel uncomfortable.
But I'm glad you look better.
Oh yeah, thank you for the other day.
You're a good cook.
Yeah, then get sick again.
So I can cook for you again.
How do you like this place?
It's really nice to be out after working inside all day.
It's like another world, another life in there.
I'll take you to a better place next time.
I saw you wearing new shoes.
Does it fit?
How did you know my size?
Just an eye measurement.
I'm always receiving things from you.
What is it?
What's the event?
Nothing...
I just wanted to celebrate something.
Enjoy your cake...
What did you want to celebrate?
Remember you sent me a Lucky tree?
It blossomed today.
Really?
That's really rare.
Yeah I know, but it did.
If something good really happens, it's because of you.
I had fun today.
Getting some fresh air...
You're a good conversationist and smiled a lot too today.
You helped me.
I haven't had such a good time in a while.
- Really?
- Yeah!
Yeah.
Next time, I'm buying.
Cool.
Don't you invite me for a cup of coffee?
Coffee?
It's too late tonight.
I'll make it for you next time.
Okay.
I can't believe it's time to go already.
Drive safely.
And thanks for the flowers.
Yup.
Hyun-joo!
Hold on.
Hyun-joo, can I like you?
You still hate me?
No, it's just...
I'm not sure...
Hyun-joo, if you want,
I can quit being a gangster.
To tell you the truth, I've never liked anyone but you.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
Congratulations.
Seems like a hit.
- Hey, thanks.
- Min-ho.
- You're here.
- You did a greatjob.
Everybody's talking about how good the movie it.
It's good.
It's a good piece ofwork.
Really?
You must work with me next time then.
Thank you.
Director!
Hey, Ji-ae
- Hello, Director.
- Hi.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for coming.
Did Ji-ae cause you trouble?
No, she was great.
Director, I think it's a hit.
Everyone's talking about it.
Yeah.
I wish you best of luck.
By the way, didn't you invite Byung-doo?
I tried calling him but he wouldn't pick up.
Right, he's so busy these days with work.
I see.
Let's have a drink sometime.
Sure.
Have more.
I hope you like it.
It tastes exactly like when I had it in elementary.
I'm glad.
Take some home with you.
She's made plenty.
It's not worth taking home.
Hyun-joo, come over often.
Okay.
A tip for my sister-in-law, it tastes better with salt and sugar.
You're embarrassing her.
It's my wishful thinking.
Byung-doo, you'd like that too.
You've become a different person ever since you've been dating her.
No I haven't.
Your brother always talks about you.
How pretty and smart you are.
Really?
I'm so happy you're with him.
He has a good heart.
Always bringing all sorts of medicine.
You need to get well soon.
Yes, boss.
Where are you?
I'm having dinner with my family.
So oblivious...
Pardon?
Are you alright?
What kind of driving is that?
I'm sorry, I had a small drink...
I'm sorry.
What?
You're driving drunk?
Let me see your license.
I don't have one.
Then let me see your ID.
I don't have that either.
No ID?
What kind of person would drive without a license?
- You know who I am?
- I sure do.
Hello, attorney Choi!
Long time no see.
Who did you do it to?
Go ahead and tell me.
Min-ho.
I took my boss.
Why?
There must've been a reason for taking him.
You wouldn't do that to your boss for no reason.
You can't tell anyone about this...
How far does he know?
I didn't mention anything about you.
Trust me, boss.
Are you out of your mind?
How could you tell him?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
Why did Sang-chul end up that way?
What will happen if your friend went about telling everyone?
He won't do such a thing, boss.
How can you be sure?
You did it.
You clean it up.
Look over here, good.
Okay, once more.
Now, hold your fists, pose like a gangster.
Smile a little more.
A little more, good!
Your characters are very real.
Did you interview real gangsters?
I watched a lot of gangster movies like "THE GODFATHER" and "SCARFACE".
I'm sorry, I should've called you.
Why did you do that?
I trusted you when I told you that.
You shouldn't have done it if you considered me your friend.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, but...
Sorry?
What ifthis ruins me?
You don't give a fuck, do you?
Hey, listen to me.
Listen to what?
I thought hard about it.
I figured it would be harmless.
Everyone knows about the case and anyone could've don
You've watched it too.
It's not about you.
I made it up.
Think about it.
Kim Mim-ho.
Okay, let's say it was my mistake.
But gangsters can do anything to cover their mistakes.
You wondered what it'd be like being stabbed.
Let me sayjust one thing.
Shut up for the rest of your life.
Okay?
Can you do that?
Yes.
I'll take it to my grave.
If something happens, I'm not going down alone.
Got it?
You trust him?
I don't.
He even made it into a movie.
I said I got it under control.
Stop talking about it.
And start gathering boys for the model house.
If you can't do it because he's your friend,
I'll do it.
What?
Leave it up to me.
You son of a bitch!
You stay out ofthis.
What do you mean, stay out of it, boss?
It's my business so you can stay out of it!
Boss, this isn't just about you.
Our whole family's on the line.
Why are you covering for that fucking bastard?
Will you take care of us, ifwe all get fucked up?
You son of a bitch!
Shit.
I'll fucking shut you up.
Didn't I say I got it under control?
Don't you ever mention that in front of me again.
Long time no see, boss.
Stop.
Boss... how could you?
Unlike our boss,
I don't know you very well,
Ain't that so you pussy.
Sorry to worry you, boss.
I got everything under control now.
- Don't make another mistake.
- Yes, boss.
Model house and sales start next week.
So be prepared.
Yes, boss.
Our boss saved you this time.
But we'll be watching you.
Better keep your mouth shut.
We're on the same boat now.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your help.
It's doing well.
Yes, I'm glad.
What was the competition rate for sales contract until yesterday?
It was 50 to 1 until this morning.
I knew it would do well.
- You did?
- Thank you.
We brought more boys.
Set them over there to lift the atmosphere.
- Okay.
- Okay, boss.
Mr. HWANG, the competition is now 70 to 1 .
The banks are panicking.
They running out of applications.
Good, keep checking!
Congratulations, boss.
It's a huge success.
You did a lot ofwork.
Prepare a big feast for the employees tonight.
Let's go in.
Digger!
Hey, Myung-goo!
What is a family?
It's a mouth that eats from the same table.
That's right.
Our family will go all the way!
I can't trust you
I can't I can't
You must grow up
You must You must
It's no use explaining but your heart is good
Today it's chrysanthemum Tomorrow it's rose
You'll fall asleep tired from flirting!
Everybody!
I'm tired of waiting Digger Digger
I'm so lonely tonight
Lonely, so lonely
You're a digger I can't help it
You're a digger I have to cry
I'm so lonely tonight
Lonely, so lonely
I enjoyed your movie.
I was so realistic.
So, why did you call me?
Is something troubling you?
Byung-doo!
Can you come with me?
What is it?
What's the good news?
Tell me.
Not here, come with me.
I'm busy right now.
How about after work?
I can't wait that long.
What is it?
Tell me!
I wanted to say it in a better setting.
Take this first.
- What is it?
- Open it.
- KIM Byung-doo!
- Stop!
- Stay right there!
- Move!
Don't move!
- Catch him!
- Shit!
- Stop!
- Stop!
Move!
Fuck!
Move!
Freeze!
Go around, go around!
Boss, sorry to come by like this.
Jong-gyu, step outside for a while.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, boss.
So what is your plan?
You're gonna hide forever?
I'll clean up the mess since I caused it.
I'll take Min-ho.
What?
I'll finish him and I'll leave the country too.
He's big now.
Things can get more complicated.
I can do it, boss.
Just make sure you give me my share.
It's all my family can depend on.
Just in case things go wrong,
I won't mention your name.
The movie broke the record and sold five million tickets.
Thank you again.
Now let me introduce director KIM Min-ho.
Hello, I'm KIM Min-ho, the director ofthe movie.
I'm happy to meet all of you.
Thank you for watching our movie.
There were some difficult moments in making this movie, but I never dreamed a day like this would come.
- Yeah, Jong-soo.
- We are arrived.
I'll be right there.
It was crazy going into that theater.
I'm glad we hired those bodyguards.
Thanks detective!
Why do you look so down?
You should cheer up on a day like this.
Let's have a drink.
Come on, director!
Let's have a drink.
I don't want to ruin this, but I should leave now.
- You can't leave!
- No you can't, director!
We're going clubbing after this.
Come on!
I feel ashamed...
Leting you guys down...
I should've listened to you.
That was my biggest mistake.
What good is it to regret the past, boss?
We just need to try solving it.
After this, while I'm gone, you guys live quietly for 2 years.
And be a good boss to the boys while I'm gone.
- Okay, boss.
- Boss!
How are you?
Good, what's going on?
They're about to go somewhere else.
Okay.
I'll go ahead, you wait outside.
Be careful, boss.
- Is this on you?
- I told you, everything's on me!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Director, you need to drink with us!
- Sang-hee, make him drink.
- Come on, director!
Director, let's do a love shot!
Love shot!
Love shot!
There you go, you can drink!
The best director!
You must be tired.
You must be more tired than me, detective.
I'm used to this, it's myjob.
Detective, why don't you have a drink with us too?
Oh no, I'm fine.
I met him when I went to the station.
He's been a lot of help.
Hold on.
- Yes?
- Director, where are you?
Me?
Director, where were you?
I was in the men's room.
Come on!
Let's go dance.
No, not me.
You have to go with us.
- Let's go together.
- No, I'm okay.
Close all the exits!
We've got Min-ho, boss.
Really?
Okay, I'll meet you there.
I'm here.
Where are you?
Catch him!
Son of a bitch!
Fucking...
Who are you?
Fucking
Catch him!
Son of a bitch!
Boss!
What's going on?
Boss, something went wrong.
Let's clean up.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.
We're nearly there.
What?
What do you mean?
Yes, boss.
- Turn the car around.
- Yes, boss.
Thank you
I'll see you at the house after the funeral.
Yes, boss.
Thank you.
Bye.
You came...
Go in and call me.
Has Byung-doo called?
Not since his last text message a few days ago...
Really?
Don't worry too much.
He'll come back soon.
Yeah.
- Okay, take care.
- Bye.
- You go ahead drink first.
- Yes, sir.
So what is your next movie going to be about?
I haven't decided yet.
How about my past love story?
Excuse me?
You see, I've had a hell of a drama in my love life.
Oh, I see...
Let's meet often to talk about it.
If you like the story, you don't need to worry about the money.
Since you're good at making up stories,
I think you'll do it well.
Oh, no, no, really...
But don't make it too similar, my wife might kill me.
Yup, a fiction will always be a fiction.
- Your guest has arrived.
- How are you, boss?
Good.
Come on in.
What are you waiting for?
Bring them in!
I'll bring them right in.
They're important guest, so treat them as you best clients.
Of course.
You know Jong-soo?
Yes.
You know the director?
Yes, boss.
I know him well.
Since you won't be in Seoul for a while, drink up and enjoy.
Thank you, boss.
And congratulations for winning the award.
Lets forget the past and start fresh.
Cheers!
This is one of my favorite songs.
The lyrics are good.
Hey, Min-ho.
Make something with a real Gangster spirit.
Bye!
- You mean we bought a racehorse?
- Yes.
Listen.
We've bought a horse through the company.
- We now own a racehorse.
- When did this happen?
I've been looking into it for the last two weeks.
I had a great offer in the weekend, so I went for it.
- How much did it cost?
- 700,000 kroner.
It's a living creature!
They're not free, you know.
Relax.
We'll earn money with it.
It's a super horse.
We'll race it and win money and then sell it again one day.
It just came as a surprise to me.
It's more fun than shipping stocks or some Internet-Skype shit.
Look at the surroundings here.
Look around you!
Hi.
Could you take him out, Helena?
Come and have a look.
- That's our horse?
- Yes.
- Isn't he great?
How is he today?
- He's fine.
- What's his name?
- Biggie Blackie.
- Are you a derby winner?
- Of course.
I went to vet school, so I know a thing or two.
- Nice, new shoes as well.
- Isn't it great?
What are you doing over there?
Are you scared of him?
You're scared of him!
- He's scared of our horse.
- No, I'm not.
I've got asthma.
We paid 700,000 for a thing you can't touch?
We pay our secretary 700,000.
We can't touch her either.
That didn't stop you, though.
- Congratulations.
- Don't.
I'm allergic to the horse.
- I just wanted to congratulate you.
- You're putting horse on it.
- Now we need to find a jockey.
- Shouldn't we have done that first?
No.
You need a horse to lure them.
Biggie Blackie is a great horse.
With him we can get the good jockeys.
They want to win races.
But they're hard to get.
They're bloody disloyal.
Isn't asthma a psychological thing?
Hey!
That's my car.
Wait!
- God, that was last minute.
- You'll get the fine anyway.
- You can't be serious.
- A rule is a rule.
Can't we work something out?
Take a deep breath.
- You've been here too long.
- There's plenty of spaces.
Parking is about making sure that everyone can get a space.
Stop.
And don't touch my car.
I don't like it.
I told you I'm not going to pay.
I'm leaving now.
Listen to me!
- You're getting it anyway.
- No, damn it.
I don't want it!
- You got it now.
- No.
Here, take it!
Hey!
Wait a minute.
Stay here and take your damn fine!
No.
I gave it to you.
It's yours.
I know who you are.
If I see you again, I'll blow your brains out!
- Annoying bitch.
- Yeah.
Hideous little hobbit.
- Aren't you taking the fine?
- I'm not paying that!
- It's not going to disappear.
- Why take it when I'm not paying?
Be a bit more charming about it.
Speak nicely to people.
I was speaking nicely!
I said, "Let's work something out."
"I'll put it here..." No, you won't!
She can't touch my property.
- She can't touch my stuff!
- No, but you're a bit highly strung.
Whose side are you on?
I was attacked by a parking attendant.
If you'd been nice to her you wouldn't have had the fine.
- She shouldn't have given it to me!
- Well, it's her job...
That doesn't mean she can't be friendly, for Christ's sake!
Incredible how much money they spend on these bank buildings.
- Hi.
I'm Thomas.
Welcome.
- I'm Mia.
- Hi.
Are you Thomas?
- Yes.
Have a seat, please.
- Hi.
Are you Thomas?
- Yes.
Have a seat, please.
- It's cold outside, eh?
- Yes, it is.
It's nothing you can't get used to.
As we talked about on the phone, flex loans are too risky.
I've considered all the pros and cons, and I've decided that we'd like to go for a fixed loan.
We'd like to know our expenses, so we don't have that uncertainty.
We can offer you 4.5%.
I've prepared a 4.5% loan, which is ready for you to sig n.
A fixed loan would be sensible, and the interest rate is good.
We'd like to go for that.
I think we should give it a bit more thought.
We've already talked about it, Frank.
I've been through all the papers.
- Why not sign it now?
- It's a lot of money.
The longer you wait, the bigger the risk of the interest rate going up.
- I think we need a second opinion.
- A what?
- A second opinion.
Right, honey?
- Why?
- An extra look at the papers.
- You haven't even read the papers.
- Well, now I'm interested.
- Thomas, we better...
I can't guarantee the same cheap rate next time, of course.
Super.
Thanks anyway.
Bye, Frank.
See you.
- I thought it was strange...
- Weird behaviour.
- Yes.
Maybe it was.
- Poor guy.
It's not normal to have a black bank adviser.
- Oh, so that's why.
- Of course it is.
Blacks aren't normally interested in financial matters.
They're interested in sport, music, dance and that sort of thing.
It was weird.
And then he had that stupid plant.
That's no reason for not signing the papers.
Refinancing is a matter of trust.
If you're the least bit unsure whether you can trust someone, you ask for a second opinion.
I thought it was difficult to read his facial expressions.
I couldn't tell whether he was happy or angry.
It all looked the same.
All whites are wary of afro-Danes.
I don't know about that.
I had a black boyfriend once.
You what?
Christ, Frank!
What a shocker.
When did you find out?
- Today.
- Jesus Christ..!
- It was a real blow.
- It doesn't get worse than that.
Do you know how the girls react when they've been with a Negro?
Well, they have huge willies.
You know that, yeah?
They have the biggest willies of all.
No less than 10 inches.
We're talking this big.
It's a fucking baton, a pipe...
- Stop, stop.
- And Mia, that little person...
Take it easy, Frank.
Take a deep breath.
I would give everything I own for another inch.
The car, the house...
I could earn the money again.
If only I could have another inch.
And they're fast, the blacks.
They shag on the first date.
As if they were threatened by a white guy with an elephant gun...
- Well, forget it, Frank...
- I don't think mine is even 8 inches.
I found a jockey, by the way.
Really good guy.
Desmond.
He's white.
So now the whole horse thing is rolling.
It's time to ride.
On the horse, you know...
Four of us were fighting for him.
But you know me.
I laid it on.
And he could see from the pedigree that it's a fantastic horse.
You're not listening, Frank.
Can't you be a bit happy?
- Frank...
- 10 inches!
- He's taking the bend nicely.
- Yeah, it's looking good.
- He's taking the bend nicely.
- Yeah, it's looking good.
He's 10 seconds faster than that other horse I was looking at.
Look at Biggie Blackie.
That's our horse!
God, he's fast!
I think we're five seconds from the track record.
We've got a derby winner!
- What are you talking about?
- It's cool, love conquering height.
- Size doesn't matter.
- That's what my girlfriend says!
What's happening?
I was just complimenting them.
Because she's taller than him.
- What the hell did you say?
- I just said he was a bit small.
Do you realise how much money is at stake here?
- I was just complimenting them.
- Not about height!
I had no idea he was so sensitive.
I'm really sorry.
We talked it over with him and his girlfriend, who is very sweet...
- Yeah, she was quite...
- I'm not going to hit on her yet.
- No, that wouldn't be very clever.
- That would be insane.
No way..!
But we're allowed to park here.
- There's the bastard.
- Casper, don't!
I'll handle it.
Excuse me?
Can I just comment on this fine?
- Hey, come back!
- Great, Frank.
I just want to talk to you!
Come here.
- What happened?
- Casper!
My eyes!
I can't see anything!
She sprayed my eyes with something.
They're burning!
- It hurts like hell!
- I can't hear anything.
- Was it pepper spray?
- It sounds like it.
- Is he going to be blind?
- No, but we'll check him anyway.
- Will I need eye surgery?
- Take care, Frank.
- Are you coming with me?
- It's not necessary, is it?
See you, Frank.
Frank!
I need your car keys!
The car keys, Frank!
I feel like the Czar's courier, when his eyes miraculously recover.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Kenneth.
- I'm Frank.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
You've had an offer for refinancing your loan?
We'd like a second opinion on the refinancing.
There's just one little thing compared to the earlier offer.
There's just one little thing compared to the earlier offer.
Thomas, could you come over for a sec?
Any problems?
The effective interest rate was 4.5%, right?
What are you talking about?
Thomas isn't looking at it again, is he?
Well, he was the one who prepared the offer...
But we asked for another person's opinion, a second opinion.
- That's what we're getting.
- No.
Now Thomas is here.
- Then it's not a second opinion.
- We just need to sort out...
- Of course.
- I don't think it will be the same.
Don't look at the papers!
Kenneth is looking at it now.
You gave us a super offer, but we don't want the two offers mixed up.
- They won't be.
- We need a second opinion.
- That's what we're getting.
- I don't think so.
We're all trained, so there shouldn't be any problems.
I would never ask the same contractor to give me a second offer.
We're getting an offer from Kenneth.
- The products are the same...
- Please go.
- Is it because I'm black?
- No...
We're trying to help you, you know.
Well, it is strange for a black guy to have a veritable jungle on your desk, if you don't want people noticing you're black.
- We're all colleagues...
- Sorry, Kenneth.
Why shouldn't people notice that I'm black?
What's it got to do with this?
- We apologise, Thomas.
- It doesn't affect your refinancing.
Frank got some spray in his eyes.
That's why he's acting like that.
I'm sorry it had to affect you.
It's hurting again now.
Since you had the last offer, the interest rate has gone up.
We can't offer you quite the same conditions.
- It's not 4.5% anymore?
- No, it's 4.7 now.
That's a crap offer.
It'll be about 2400 a year, so over 30 years it's 60.000.
- I didn't get a second opinion.
- You made me look bad as well.
I guess it still affects me that you've been with a guy like that.
- Frank, honestly...
- Just answer me one thing.
- We'll never talk about it again.
- What?
How long was it?
- More or less than 10 inches?
- It's the inside that counts.
- Fine, so answer the question.
- Stop it.
Good night.
Was it longer than 10 inches?
- Why do you want me to answer?
- I just need to know.
- You don't need to feel inferior.
- I'm not feeling inferior!
Coming.
- H i.
A Man They Called Horse.
- Thanks a lot.
- Ready?
- You bet.
- Hi, Mia.
Are you nervous?
- A bit.
It's exciting.
- I'm dead excited.
- Are you, Casper?
- We can win 100,000, right?
- Yes, but it's not just the money.
This is something we've been dreaming about.
It's our thing.
Look what I bought.
A Tag Heuer.
Really cool watch.
It's for Desmond.
The jockey.
Could you give it to him before the race?
I want to make sure there are no hard feelings, and that Desmond is going to give it 100 percent.
- Why don't you do it yourself?
- I'm not going down there.
Imagine us winning the race, and then I get asthma.
- I don't even know about laurels.
- Have you been up to something?
Frank made a comment about Desmond's height.
He's this tall.
He's a tiny guy with huge size issues.
I've got a little thing for Frank as well.
To celebrate the race.
A pepper spray...
I would have preferred a watch.
- Casper!
- Number 3, Biggie Blackie, is out.
Biggie Blackie will not be running in the third race.
God, that was crap.
Should we look for a new jockey?
- Don't you think jockeys talk?
- You think they have a network?
Of course they have a network!
Hi there.
How did it go?
Well...
Not so good?
Oh.
You lost, or..?
It's hard to say, seeing as the horse didn't even race.
- Was the race cancelled?
- No.
Our horse didn't run.
- What happened?
- Mr. Genius here...
- Just ruin my door, will you?
- Easy now.
He sprayed the jockey with pepper spray.
Right before the race!
- You did what, Frank?
- He freaked out at me.
Why?
Because I accidentally lifted him.
He couldn't see Casper...
Don't go around lifting people.
By the way, Mia...
Could you do me a favour?
Next time you shag a Negro, please don't tell Frank.
- He freaks out, you know...
- I'm not even going to answer that.
It would make my life a whole lot easier, if you stayed off Uncle Tom.
- Why do you say that?
- Well, that must be the reason.
- Why did you tell Casper that?
- I didn't.
- How did he know, then?
- He must have guessed.
Honestly!
You tell that guy everything.
I just want to know what I'm up against.
You're not starting that again.
Do you hear?
- It's so childish.
- Yes.
Well, how long was that willie?
12½ inches...
- It's sheer madness, Frank.
- Absolutely insane.
- Why don't we sell Biggie Blackie?
- Why?
I don't want a horse with that name.
And so DeVanzo stands in.
Six foot first baseman out of Pawtucket.
fine form on this fellow.
Shot down the line.
That's a frozen rope.
Base hit in anybody's league.
And here's Captain Jeter steps up to the plate to his usual hip-hop music.
And look at the triceps on this youngster.
Someone was busy in the Nautilus room during the off-season.
He'll give the fans a treat and do a little flexing.
That's right.
There're a couple of actresses on the front row... that are going out of their minds right about now.
Yeah!
And sometimes he'll get in there and just give the fans a treat... and show them some of the finer points of hitting.
Fuck!
Absolute pe_ect ten on this fellow.
Quite a specimen.
385 hitter, 23 ding-dongs.
He's driven in 162 runs.
He's 30 sit-ups away from the body of a young Willie Mays!
And that's a single up in the middle.
Looked more like a double play to me, you fat fuck.
What the fuck did you say?
I said softball's for girls and faggots... and girl faggots like you.
You piece of shit!
Mom!
the fat fuck new door is chasing me again!
Anybody had seen my softball hat?
- Michael?
- Yeah.
- Did you look at these cakes, yet?
- Yeah, yeah.
I like that one.
Hey, Marie, Marie, get the hat!
Gina, get the hat!
- You didn't even look?
- Marie, that's not funny!
Okay, you know what?
I'm not being a bitch here.
You're missing Marie's recital tonight... and I said we could wait for after the softball season to go on our honeymoon.
I even let you pick your scumbag friend Artie as best man.
Sweetheart, listen, it's the first game of the season.
I just don't want to be late, alright?
I'm with you on the cake.
So I'll look at them later.
You know, I was gonna surprise you... by making your little plastic man on the cake... a Derek Jeter action figure.
But now, no.
I'm making you one of those Puerto Ricans from the fucking Mets.
Don't even joke like that, Gina!
- I'm coming back tomorrow for tanning.
- You better.
Hey!
Mark Vicki Galliotta down as paid up for this month.
And another dumb slut gets herpes.
Hey!
I don't want any of you Italians drinking out of my water bottle!
Damn Wops.
- Come on, Maz, let's warm up already.
- Don't mess with my pre-game ritual.
Putting on mascara is not a pre-game ritual.
- Let's go!
- Stop busting my chops, I'm coming.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
What's up, brother?
Check it out.
- My new Italiano mitt.
- That's cool, Alfonse.
How much of a Guido can you possibly be?
Fuck you, Johnny.
I'll see you out there.
- What's up?
- Starting earlier this year?
Ready for the big day, opening day, big game?
Maz, we stink evey year.
This is not a big game.
- Yes, it is.
- It's not a big game.
Yes, it is.
I blew off my daughter's ballet recital for this.
I've seen your daughter dance.
She sucks.
- No, she doesn't.
- Yeah, she does.
- Which one, ballet or tap?
- It all sucks.
- What's up, boys?
- What's up, Manganelli?
So, Maz, how's the wedding coming?
Are you nervous?
I'm doing okay.
Gina's freaking out a little, but...
My cousin is a good kid, but she can be a real ball-breaker.
What are you going to do?
All right, listen up.
Anybody who doesn't do a pre-game shout with me right now is a fucking pussy.
Jerk off!
Did this jerk off just call me a jerk off?
Come on, let's not ruin another game with a big fight, all right?
Dave!
Arto.
Fellows.
Dad, I'm thirsty.
Can I have some?
No.
Go steal that little kid's soda.
Bro, look at yourself.
You're an unemployed drunk... you play softball in corduroy and you still live with your mother.
You shave your body hair, wear Speedos down the short... and root for the Dallas Cowboys.
Hey, that's America's team, asshole.
Not in Jersey, asshole.
We grew up fifteen minutes from Giant Stadium... you're a fucking Cowboys' fan?
You're lust iealous.
My softball team won this league for years in a row... going on five.
This year you're not getting that trophy.
No?
Who's going to stop me, you?
In high school, I was the best baseball player.
You were second best.
I was the best football player.
You were second best.
And, bro, the chicks I got... were way out of your league.
I did fine.
You fucked skanks.
Skanks?
You're looking at the first guy to bang Jan Martucci.
Wow, definitely not a skank.
I'm sory.
- Lisa Riccio.
- Monica Nelson.
- Danielle Battaglia.
- Marisa Salvanto.
- Karen Dever.
- Tina Gardner.
- Karen Dever.
- Pinky Calabr...
You lust said Karen Dever.
Well, we did more than once.
Okay, I guess we're done here, bro.
Because you're out of names, and I got like fifty more.
I see you on the field, loser.
Yeah, go ahead.
Run away, jerk off.
Run away!
Bring it in!
Now coming to bat is Artie DeVanzo.
Last season was a fine one for DeVanzo, we all know that.
- Come on, Artie.
- He batted. 420 with 45 RBls.
- Come on, Artie.
- Batter up!
He entgrs tDday's game... with a bl_ alcohol content of.16.
If you kids are scoring at home, that's an impressive mice the legal limit.
- Let's get it go, buddy!
- The DeVanzo shift!
What do you say, Art?
- Let's go, Artie.
- Let's go, Arto.
Let's go!
What's this shit, Manganelli?
It's my new defense strategy.
All right side is open for you, Artie.
Go for it, bro.
All right, go the other way with it, Artie.
He's tying to fool you, don't be stupid.
Come on!
- Come on, Artie!
- Let's go, baby!
Come on now!
Shit!
So, of course, he pulls it.
Hey, the shift works good, Manganelli.
- Run, Artie, run!
- Artie, run!
Run, man!
- Come on, Artie!
- Get it over there!
Out!
Nice hustle, Artie.
You're a fat fucking disgrace!
He's a fat guy.
Come on, Dirt.
Start it off, kid.
Come on now.
All right, Dirt.
Come on, Dirt.
Lay it in there, baby.
Come on, Dirt.
Let's go!
What do you say, Dirt?
You character.
All right, Dirt.
Come on now.
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!
You disappoint me as much as my kids for Christ's sake.
Okay, here we go!
Here we go, coming home.
Come on, get it in.
Get it in!
Hit the cut-off man!
Yeah!
Cut-off man!
Cut-off man!
Learn to love him.
- You're killing us!
- The hell are you doing?
One second!
I'm having a smoke.
What's up your ass?
- I got it!
- Shit.
Cocky prick!
He's tagging!
No, Dave, don't go!
Hold on!
Come on!
Nice play.
- Good job.
- You're out.
Good iob.
Come on, let's see it, Dirt.
Let's see it, Dirt.
Fuck, no pitch.
Hey, Tim, I want to let you know...
I've done a lot of thinking about that talk we had last year.
I don't even know if you remember.
I remember.
When I overheard you telling that joke at the bar, right?
Exactly.
You know, if we weren't good friends...
I would've handled that quite differently, right?
Hey, look, just so you know, I don't even use the "N" word anymore.
Like just now, instead of saying the actual word, I just say the "N" word.
I appreciate that, Artie.
That's a good start.
Good for you, man.
That's okay, Dave.
Keep swinging.
As a matter of fact, listen how I tell this joke now.
A priest, a Rabin and a "N" word walk into a bar...
All right, hold up, hold up, hold up!
Strike three, you're out!
- That was...
- That's three.
Come on!
Let's get these guy!
Let's get these punk!
He's nothing!
He's an asshole!
A cocksucker!
He's a total piece of shit!
You shut up, fatso.
- Hey, watch the name-calling!
- Come on, Dirt.
Let's go now!
Pop up!
- You got it!
- You got it!
- Jesus Christ!
- Shit!
I'm not angy.
Just give me the ball.
You son of a bitch!
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
We look like shit.
Come on.
Hey, DeVanzo...
If you're going to ask if you can suck my left nut the answer is "maybe".
Do you ever think that if I didn't exist... your life wouldn't suck so bad?
We grew up the same age, in the same town, at the same school.
If I wasn't around, maybe you could've had what I have.
Wait, I forgot.
If I didn't exist, you'd still be a total fucking jadrool.
Come on!
Get it in into second!
Come on!
Force at second!
Out!
He tripped him, Ump!
He tripped him!
I didn't see it.
- Nice!
Way to be!
- Cocksucker!
- Way to be!
- No, no, no!
- Get off of me!
- Come on!
Put his head over here.
Come on!
Don't stretch the shirt.
This guy's such a pussy.
Yeah?
I'll La Motta your face, okay?
Yeah, let's go.
Returning for round two.
Come on, who wants to dance with me again?
Who's feeling lucky?
You feeling lucky?
You're lucky the cops showed up, okay?
I'm ready.
I'm not tired.
Who's feeling lucky?
Don't eyeball me, tough guy.
When I was in the joint, I fucked guys bigger than you.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Hey, did Dirt just say he used to fuck guys?
Never mind that.
We're waiting to find out how much trouble you got us into this time.
Me?
He started it.
Alright.
Listen up.
First thing's first.
- DeVanzo?
- Yeah?
You're an asshole.
Now, as far as the fighting goes between you're two guys' teams... this bullshit will not continue.
It happens evey year... and it's the first game of the season, for Christ's sakes.
So, new year... one of you guys' teams is gonna have to play in a different league.
What?
Wow, I wonder who you gonna decide to ask to leave?
I'm not gonna decide, ierk-off.
Dennis Manganelli here suggested you jerk-offs decide it on the field.
Whichever team does better stays in the league.
The other team is gone new year.
That sucks?
- You gotta be kidding.
- We are so fucked.
I think we could do it.
All we gotta do is practice.
Practice is for fags.
Hey, are we done here?
Because I'm losing my buzz.
In two fucking seconds, I'm gonna Taser you.
Anybody here who's not an asshole have a question?
I do.
How come I'm the only one who's locked up?
Be right with you.
How are we gonna deal with that?
Hey, Linda.
Hey, Artie.
Hey, et me buy you a drink.
No, I can't.
I gotta meet my friends over at Ducky's.
What happened to you?
Oh, this?
I saw three guys mugging an old lady, so I got involved.
- Really?
- Yeah, she was a tough old broad... but in the end we got her purse.
Bye-bye.
Good night, Ed.
Hey, Ed.
Get some beers over here.
Whisky.
Come on.
Jesus!
You like you had the shit kicked out of you.
Yeah?
Imagine how the other guy looks.
I imagine a guy completely unharmed with badly bruised knuckles.
Don't you have livers to ruin?
Totally fucked, this man.
Listen, now that the games mean something, we'll be great.
This is just gonna help us play better.
Hey, Maz, do you think you can use the fight as a reason... to disinvite Manganelli from your wedding?
He's Gina's cousin.
He's gonna be there.
And you're my best man, so, you're gonna be there.
And I'll have no bullshit from either of you.
I fucking swear.
Hey, I'm not one to start trouble.
Oh, my God, you fat fucking liar.
An insane thing to say.
Hello.
Hey, Gina.
Tell her you're still single for six weeks and hang up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've been thinking quite a bit about he cakes.
Yeah.
Man, is he whipped.
All right.
Now, that Maz is gone... we can talk a little bit about his bachelor party.
Now, I've lined up five cousin "hoors" for the event.
One of them is called "The Pitching Machine".
Now, you're never in a million fucking years... ever 90nna 9UeSS why she's called that.
Go ahead, guess.
She shoots ping pong balls out of her snatch?
The name gives it away.
Guys, let me ask you a question.
Why do so many diners have a "happy waitress" special?
None of these waitresses ever seem happy.
It's true.
They should call it a "bitchy broad with three kids... no husband and a shitty apartment in Linden" special.
Parts of Linden are nice.
Hey, Rhonda.
I didn't mean anything by it.
But not the part I live in.
What do you guys want?
Let me get a bacon, egg and cheese on a hard roll... with side order of fries, cheese and gra_... and a bowl of gra_ on the side.
I'll have the same thing plus pancakes.
- Chocolate milk?
- You know it, honey.
Make it two.
I'll have an egg white omelet made with vey little oil... dy wheat toast and grapefruit juice.
Oh, my God.
That's the gayest order I ever heard.
In Massachusetts, that order could legally mary a dude.
Here it comes.
Just placing an order like that gets you kicked out of the army.
If you put a construction helmet on that order, it could join the Village People.
Would you guys knock it off so I can do my job?
Thank you.
All right, Maz.
That's an egg white omelet... dy wheat toast, grapefruit iuice?
That right.
You want a side order of cock with that?
We got it in fresh.
It's delicious.
- That people from Linden, I tell you...
- Trust me.
- G_ point.
- Come on!
So, what should we do now?
It's getting late.
Anyone with a job should go home.
- Good night, Maz.
- Vey funny, ball tugger.
Good night, Johnny.
- Hey, I got an idea.
- What?
- Manhattan!
- What?
- No way.
Can't do it.
- Come on.
The bars in the city are open for four more hours.
Holy shit, it's midnight?
I gotta get home.
That's right, I forgot.
If you're home after midnight, Gina locks up the pussy.
That's not completely true, all right?
Shut up, I'll give you a lift.
Holy shit.
- I'm hungy.
- I'm starving.
Isn't that the chick from the bar?
Oh, yeah!
That's Linda Salvo.
And she looks wasted.
Give me a quarter you fucking bitch.
- Here, whore.
- Fuck you.
I've seen her in this diner twice before when she was trashed... and I banged her both times.
Hey, I'm a little tapped.
You got a sawbuck on you?
I usually gotta buy her a Danish or something.
- All I got is four bucks.
- That'll do it.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Good luck.
Don't need it.
Hey, Linda!
Hi.
What are you broads up to?
Artie?
Artie, wake up.
Hey, good morning, Linda.
Artie, I gotta tell you.
That was the worst sex I have ever had.
I'm catching shit from eveybody lately.
What was wrong with the sex?
You got all out of breath.
You're like a chubby panda.
And then you finish in twenty seconds and fell asleep on top of me.
It was fucking horrible!
Jesus Christ, I am so pathetic.
I get drunk and then I wake up new to God knows what.
My shrink says that I do it because I think... it's the only way a guy could like me.
Be honest with me, Artie.
The only reason you like me is because I fuck you.
Not at all.
I mean, it's awesome.
Look, I really like you.
What do you say, you wanna go out on a regular date or something?
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah, we could go out, grab dinner... and we don't have to fuck or nothing.
It's vey fucking romantic, Artie.
Are you fucking retard?
Well, do you know what they say about retards... they have huge cocks and superhuman strength.
Well, congratulations, you're definitely not retarded.
Look, what I mean is, we could just hang out and we don't even have to have sex.
Yeah, right.
You're gonna come to my house... in your nice date clothes and pick me up with like flowers and candies?
Flowers, maybe, but evey time I buy a chick candy... somehow, it never makes all the way to her house.
Come on!
What do you say?
All right, Romeo.
It's a date.
Great!
And since I'm guaranteed no sex on the date... what do you say we take one for the team right now?
Artie, I'm gonna be late for work!
Come on!
Come on!
An e_ra twenty seconds ain't gonna matter.
Come on, baby.
All right.
But this time you either gotta put a rubber on or pull out before you come.
Good morning, Artie.
Ready for breaMast?
Sure, mom.
Hey, this is Linda.
Hello, Linda.
Would you like some breaMast too?
No, thanks.
I'm not hungy.
Can you hand me my jacket, please?
Thank you.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Linda.
Take care, Lin.
Hey, mom, sory if you overheard anything.
- Is that your new girlfriend?
- Why?
Do you like her?
I like any girl that likes my Artie.
Although clearly she's been around the block... so I would feel better if you used protection.
Thanks for the advice, mom.
Hey, mom, could you make some gobblegoo and eggs?
- Come on!
- Hear that!
Hear that!
Safe!
- Get them!
- Over there!
Turn two!
- Get them.
- Come on!
- Safe!
- Shithead!
Come on!
Not today, asshole.
Nice shot.
Come on!
Come on!
Score!
Come on!
Come on!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Jeez, you're dogging the tying run!
No, I'm not, I'm standing on the third.
That pile of elephant shit.
- Papa!
- Shit!
Papa!
You're a retard!
That means your mother must love blowing retards.
- Hey, fuck you!
- Hey, hey, hey!
It's a friend league!
Man, whoa!
- Stop!
- Fat piece of shit.
We're all friends here, Maz, do something.
- Play the game.
- Get a sense of humor, pal.
I'm impressed, Artie.
This is a really nice place.
Yeah.
That Zagat dude really knows his shit.
Backed Avedon.
That's me.
- And gnocchi.
- That's me too.
- Thanks, man.
- Alright.
Enioy.
- Take care.
- Thanks.
So where do you work?
At the AP in Lyndhurst.
This is so odd.
What is?
I mean, we've already slept together three times, right?
But, I mean, we barely know each other.
I know.
It's fucking hot, right?
No, it's not.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
You work down at the port, right?
I was a longshoreman for nine years, and then I quit last year.
Haven't had a lob in while.
Why did you quit?
Mainly, my dad.
Why'd your dad want you to quit?
Well, it wasn't like that exactly.
You see, he died.
Oh my God, I'm so sory.
Thanks.
I mean... he had a heart attack on the lob.
He installed cable TV for a living.
I had to watch him spend evey waking hour doing a job that he hated.
I mean the only time he was happy was when someone would tip him... an e_ra twenty bucks to hook up Cinemax illegally or something.
You know, I can see why you quit your job.
See, you don't want to like spend your life... doing something that you hated, just like your father.
You now what?
That sounds great, but the truth is I'm probably just a lazy prick.
You know, I think you're a cute lazy prick.
Thanks.
But I've been doing all the yapping.
What about you?
You got any stories about your father?
Yeah, I got one.
Once, when I was five years old... my dad went out to get ice cream and he never came back.
You serious?
Wow, I'm really sory.
Don't be, shit happens.
I can't imagine the pain you must have been in because of that.
But I think I got a way to make you feel better right now.
Oh, yeah?
Waiter!
Order ice cream for this woman.
Pronto!
Oh, God!
You're a fucking idiot, Artie.
You know, I'm gonna have some too.
Waiter, three orders of ice cream.
Come on!
What's up?
Come on, Artie, are you ever serious?
- No, and I tell you why.
- Why?
The only people who get laid less than funny fat guys... are serious fat guys.
I feel sory for those assholes.
Artie!
Artie, wait.
I thought we weren't gonna have sex tonight.
I know!
What are you tying to pull here?
Come on, Artie.
Come on, this is important to me.
That's cool.
Although for medical reasons I'll need a hand job.
Artie!
Come on, I'll be quick.
It'll really help me get to sleep.
I can't mess up this car.
It's a lease.
Hey, I have great aim.
Just let me know where you want it... ash tray, floor mat, change cup.
All right, listen... if you're really quick...
I'll give you a blowiob.
But you gotta be quick.
Are you kidding me?
I hear you.
When blowjobs go on too long, it's like you chicks forget guy's dicks get tired.
Stop with the jokes.
I gotta be up for work early tomorrow... so concentrate, okay?
I'll be Hugh Fucking Downs.
- Who the fuck is that?
- He was the host of "Concentration".
Just blow me.
I made tiramisu.
You kids want some?
No, mom!
Go back inside!
It's in the fridge if you changed your mind.
Back inside!
Just go!
Just...
I am so embarrassed right now.
You're embarrassed?
I just got cock-blocked by my mom.
DeVanzo... landscaping is a vey strenuous work.
Do you think you can handle it?
Because you're not in the best of your shape.
I'll give it a shot.
But you better give me the name of your dietitian.
DeVanzo?
DeVanzo!
Wake up!
You got one house left.
Cool!
All right.
Don't tell me is this place.
Hey!
DeVanzo?
Hot enough for you?
I think you missed a spot over there.
And another one over there.
- Out!
- Fuck!
Way to be!
Way to be!
Dave, looking good up there.
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't ty to kill it up there, all right?
Just get a nice base hit, we'll start a rally.
Come on, Maz?
A home run ties it.
I'm going for it.
Don't be stupid.
No one's hit one out of here since Dave Della Ferra in 1989.
Why don't you think I can do one too?
Because he bench pressed 400 pounds and you sweat when you eat.
So did Babe Ruth.
The DeVanzo shift, guys.
Meet the ball, Artie.
Come on.
Hey, Artie, you guys find a new league to play in yet?
Because one more out, chubs, and we're 5-O.
You guys are O-5.
Home run coming up.
That would be impressive after you spent all that energy... mowing my lawn this afternoon.
I'm actually rooting for you.
Here it comes, Tubby.
And here it goes, prick.
Yes!
- Damn!
-5-O!
5
- O, baby!
Yeah!
DeVanzo, you shithead.
Watching you hit into that double play... makes me wish I was 35 years younger.
I know, so you could kick my ass.
No, because I could kick your ass right now... but 35 years ago, I could have loaned your parents the money for an abortion.
I can't believe you can joke around like this when you're about... to get us kicked out of the softball league.
Maybe I should take up bowling.
It would be great to play a sport when there's always a bar three feet away.
So you can get even more drunk than you do now for softball?
Will you two stop?
We're not out of it yet.
Maz, will you face facts?
We're out of it.
we're not playing softball in this league... and you daughter is an atrocious dancer.
We're not done.
We can still make the playoffs.
Look, I admit that technically we can still make the playoffs.
Now you admit that your daughter's dancing is a disgrace.
Fuck you, Johnny.
I'm gonna kill you.
Go for it.
Maybe growing up with a father in jail... will help her dance with just a hint of passion.
- My man.
- You got it.
Man, that was a tough loss.
Yeah, I hate losing to those fucking Guidos.
Tim, will you watch it with that word?
- What?
Guidos?
- Yeah.
Man, you all call each other that all the time.
Yeah, I know, but it's okay when we say it.
When you say it, it's racist.
All right, Alfonse.
I respect that.
Wait a minute, I don't respect that.
Guidos aren't a race.
You're a bunch of wiggers who dress like the Sopranos.
Thank you.
I appreciate you setting up the bachelor party... it's just I know you, all right?
No crazy shit.
Promise me?
Absolutely not.
Come on, what are you, kidding me?
Eight in the corner.
Hey, Maz, I've been meaning to ask you a question.
I've been seeing this girl Linda now for a little while... and, I don't know, she's sort of becoming my girlfriend... and, I tell you what, I could see things getting serious.
- That's good for you, Art.
- Yeah.
But I'm sort of having this one problem.
Let me guess... you're tying to figure out how to tell her about the herpes.
No, no, she's got it too.
Congratulations, you've found your soul mate.
Thanks.
But the thing is this...
She's what most guys would, I don't know... charitably call "used goods".
Not for nothing, Art, but you're what most girls... would charitably call a "stinking piece of shit".
No offense.
I was offended there for a second, but then you said "no offense"... so now eveything is cool.
Anmay... the other day I was talking to her and I was tying to figure out a way... to ask her how many guys she's slept with.
Why would you want to know that?
I don't know, why does any guy want to know?
I just want to know.
What I do know is she's been having sex since she was 15 years old... so that's 15 years in the league.
Conservatively, she had to put away 25 or 30...
- For what you told me about this girl...
- I know, you're right.
She's gotta be in triple digits.
Anything less, is a lie.
Anything more and I'm gonna pull my fucking hair out.
It's all part of her past.
Why do you let it bother you?
Will you listen to me?
My suggestion is just drop the whole thing.
I don't think I can.
All right, fine.
If you're gonna ask her, you gotta be prepared... to answer the question yourself.
So what's your number?
Let's see.
I used to be better at keeping track of this.
Seventy three.
Not counting whores.
Six.
You're right, I'll drop the whole thing.
So mowing the lawns almost killed me... but I was making through the day... and then the last house turned out to be that prick Manganelli's.
Oh, no.
And then to top it off, he gets me to hit into a double play to end the game.
It was lust so fucking humiliating.
I'm so sory, honey.
Let's not talk about that asshole.
You know, to tell you the truth, all the shit with Manganelli... and us probably getting kicked out of the softball league... it's really not bothering that much.
Why not?
I think it's because of you.
Yeah?
Plus right now this weed is helping out quite a bit.
You know, my shrink says you're really good for my self-esteem.
And out of all the guys I dated, you're the only one she said that about.
Hey, let's fuck!
Artie, I don't want to wake your mom up.
Come on, don't wory.
My mother went to sleep hours ago.
Artie, I don't know.
Come on!
These walls are completely sound proof.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
Of course!
- Would I lie to you?
Come on!
- No, you wouldn't lie.
You could play drums in this fucking room.
You could do the solo from Tom Samer in this fucking room.
Who is Tom Samer?
It's a Rush song.
It's not important.
All right, I'm almost there.
Almost there.
Just about there.
Almost there.
Okay.
Not quite yet.
Almost there.
Almost there.
Grab my balls!
Pinch my nipples!
Pinch me in the back!
Harder!
Harder!
- That was too hard.
- Like this?
That's it!
That's pe_ect.
Artie, wait.
I think the rubber slipped off.
Sory!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Nice hit.
Nice hit.
Way to go, Alfonse!
Yes!
Come on, Art!
Drive me in and we win it, buddy!
Get a hit or I'm gonna shove that bat up your ass.
- Yeah!
- Vey good!
That's a nice tattoo.
I didn't realize it was the Chinese word for Guido.
Actually, this is the Chinese symbol for "fuck you".
You know, this was great tonight, man.
Getting the first win, huh?
Yeah, was.
Kind of reminds me how I'm gonna miss playing for this team.
Hey, look, I'm gonna play with my brother's team out... in Parsippany new year.
You want me to see if they need an infielder?
No, get to Parsippany is a pain in the ass twice a week.
You get traffic, Route 46...
Hey, guys, it ain't over till it's over.
Artie, you know I'm not the one who want to give up but... we're 1-5.
It's pretty over.
Way over.
Hello?
Okay, I tell him.
Hey, Art.
That was Yogi Berra.
He says it's over.
Jerk-off.
There's a way to beat Manganelli's team.
We have to...
I know what you are going to say, Art.
We gotta blow out Manganelli's fitness.
Dave, how are things at home?
Not good, man.
I'm holding in a huge piss, so could you get to the point, shithead?
All right.
We gotta practice.
Aren't you the one that said practice is for fags?
Yeah, that's when you wanted to practice.
Look, this is a beer league.
Nobody practices and that can help us.
I've been hitting softballs evey day... and I didn't drink before the game tonight the first time ever.
I could do that for the whole season.
Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy...
Manganelli's team is gonna win first place for the regular season.
We're gonna have to scratch and claw and get into second place... and then beat them in the championship game.
But if we start practicing, I think we gotta a shot.
Fellows, I've been paying softball for a long time.
This is not the best team I've ever played on.
But it ain't the worst, either.
So, if we would actually practice evey day... then, like shithead says, in this league... we gotta a shot to win at all.
How about it?
Let's have a toast.
To beat Manganelli!
Toast, my ass!
I gotta piss so badly I could drown a horse.
Talk so fucking much.
All right, that put a damper on the toast.
What do you say we just practice tomorrow?
Salud.
Bounding ball to the grindaloon at third.
He's got it.
All right.
We haven't turned a double play in like three years... so let's get two.
Come on.
Artie is here now.
Let's get two.
Good effort!
Good effort!
Way to go!
Way to go!
Damn!
You assholes know I'm being sarcastic, right?
Come on.
Let's get two.
- Damn!
- Ty not to spread your legs... like a two buck hooker.
Good, Maz!
When you wait it on like that... you don't have to lunge for the ball.
All right.
Way to be.
Now, Johnny, I noticed you've been dropping your front shoulder.
Wait a minute, you're telling me how to hit?
Please, I'm batting.687.
It's like telling Ted Williams how to hit.
Really?
I always thought of you as more like a Pete Rose type.
You know, a shitty gambler with bad hair.
Hit it!
Jesus Christ!
It's like a bunch of monkeys tying to screw a football.
Nice hit, Tim.
Way to be.
Beautiful.
You know, Dave, you might be a lefty.
Yeah.
Let's get two.
Come on!
What the fuck are you doing?
Jump!
Second base is over there, moron!
Sory, Johnny.
I...
Jesus Christ!
That is iust amul.
Really?
- I thought I hit that pretty good.
- No, your hitting is fine.
I'm talking about that disgusting Guido pink shirt.
Go home and change it.
All right, technically, this is fuchsia.
Out of my sight!
Go!
I'm gonna throw up.
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm going to see my brajool.
- Let's get two.
- Come on, fellows.
Come on!
- Yeah!
- All right!
That's what I'm talking about.
Come on now!
Now do that again and prove that was not just luck.
Let's do this.
Great.
Get two now.
Two.
Come on now!
- Yeah!
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All right!
- Way to be!
- That's the way to do it.
- Way to be!
Way to be!
Come on now, folks!
Come on, good, Guido.
Eveybody hits.
- Run, Artie!
- Slow down, asshole.
One hopper, DeVanzo.
he's got it.
- Out!
- Yeah!
Throw to first!
- Out!
- Nice, Art.
Way to pick it.
How about it?
How about it?
- Good play.
- Nice.
- Way to be.
- Don't get cocky, fucknuts.
All right, let's go.
No stick up here.
No stick?
Hey, Crispino, what's your batting average?
Fuck you, Johnny.
Who keeps that in slow pitch softball?
I'm hitting.687. Thank you.
Nice shot!
Strike three!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Nice catch!
- Look at you!
- All right.
What do you say now?
Here we go.
Turn it now.
Come on!
I'm on it, Johnny.
Out!
.463.
Nice.
No carbs.
Lobster, prime rib, those little clams.
Whatever you want.
Want to drive?
- Yeah!
- I don't think so.
What the fuck!
?
DeVanzo, you motherfucker!
Way to hit it, man.
Nice shot!
Yeah!
- That's right!
- All right!
- Congratulations!
- Nice shot!
Ten to five, baby!
Ten to five!
Nice shot!
Step right up and shoot the geek.
One hundred shots for five dollars.
Oh, my God!
Yeah!
This is getting ugly.
- All right.
- Artie, knock it off!
- Get him in his balls.
- Okay.
Get his balls.
On theses wheels I bet on Mom evey single time.
Because I love my mom, you know?
- That's so cute.
- Thanks.
All right.
Come on, "Mom"!
- Come on, "Mom"!
- Come on! "Mom", what do you say?
Come on, "Mom"!
One time with "Mom".
Just one time.
Come on, motherfucker "Mom"!
Motherfucker!
Hit "Mom"!
Motherfucker!
Come on, "Mom"!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Shit!
Cock!
Fuck!
Mothe_ucker!
Let's get away from this crooked fucking game.
It's hard to say because I totally believe in God... but I have lots of problems with the Church.
I don't think I want to be married in a church... because I would feel like a total hypocrite.
I sort of feel the same way, you know.
I'm not religious at all... but my mother went to Catholic school... so, you know, she would really want me to get married by a priest.
So I thought of this great compromise.
If I ever get married... it's going to be by a justice of the peace who's also a child molester.
You're so going to hell for that.
What?
Come on!
Five dollars, hotshot!
Where are you going?
Knock it out.
You know where you mother is?
She's waiting to pick me up.
Five dollars.
Purple monkey.
What's up, slugger?
Five bucks.
Yours, baby.
Purple monkey.
- Purple monkey, man!
- All right, Artie, you can do it!
Purple monkey, man!
All right, baby.
That's a good start.
Gotta have to settle for a pink bear, man.
- Pink bear, man!
- Come on, baby.
You got nothing!
Nothing!
- All right.
- Dude!
I got the look.
- This is going to be the one, right?
- Purple monkey!
Because he ain't going to get it today.
Loosing his hair, down on his luck... perhaps too fat for his age.
He's with a hot chick who is clearly out of his league.
Forget about it.
I don't even want one of those stupid purple monkeys.
No, on this one, I'm getting you a prize.
I guarantee, all right?
- Okay.
- Here, catch, douche!
Marie, you're a beautiful dancer.
Atrocious.
- Johnny!
- Unwatchable.
- Stop it!
- It's amul.
- Lovely.
- No, it's not lovely.
Someone's gotta tell her.
She stinks.
Look, I don't know what Artie has planned for this bachelor party...
Honey, it's no big deal, all right?
Johnny, you ready?
And I don't want to know, it's just my father might stop by...
- for a little while.
- I know.
And if he does, would you please show some respect?
Absolutely.
Don't wory about nothing.
I'll bring him back in one piece.
- You see?
- Come on.
All right, honey, I'll see you later.
Whatever.
All right, let's go.
Gina, relax.
They all have bachelor parties.
It's no big deal.
Marie, stay away from the street, sweetheart.
Just dance on the lawn.
Marilyn, it's not the bachelor party that I'm worried about, you know... it's just I can't relax when I know he's going out with fuckhead.
You mean Artie?
Did you know that at Carol Monteverdi's wedding... he got drunk and he punched the deejay in the face... because the guy wouldn't play "Rock Me, Amadeus"?
Well, we al know he's kind of pathetic... but I like Artie, and I don't think he's quite so obnoxious any more.
The 2-2 pitch to Birkenstock.
Yeah!
Down the line!
He may have it!
It's got the foul pole!
Home run!
Nice shot.
Hey, no!
Scavooch, what the fuck?
And the crowd is going crazy here at Bush Stadium.
And DeVanzo is looking to lace one back through the hole.
A little chin music.
And he may charge the round.
That's okay, it's cool.
If I have to, I'll snort the fucking rag.
- Tone that spitter, honey.
- Come on, let's take a look at that.
You got to have that.
Wait, you almost fucked us up over here.
- Dude, you got to catch that.
- I'm not catching that shit.
- He's got his own stick.
- This is going to be a good one.
Pete LeCock!
Salud!
- Salud.
- Drink this.
- Salud!
- Salud more!
- You're tying to kill me here.
- Come on, one more.
I love you.
- Fuck, cops.
- Shit!
What the fuck is going on in here?
Eveybody freeze.
- Shit!
- Hey, you son of a bitch!
Hey, look at him.
Hey, relax, guys.
Hey.
This is my cousin Mickey.
He's a Boston cop.
Funny.
Scared the shit out of you all Derek Jeter-loving motherfuckers, didn't I?
Hey, man, have a drink.
Have some fun.
- Sure, Maz.
- Thanks for coming.
Hey, black man.
Hook me up with some coke, will you?
Want a slice there, Pitching Machine?
No, I don't eat daiy.
The Pitching Machine doesn't eat daiy.
A lot of rules.
Fuck you, ho.
You ain't taking money out of my pocket.
Fuck you, bitch.
I saw him first.
You're the one taking money out of my pocket.
Come on, ladies.
Neither if you even have pockets.
Honey, your prices are outrageous.
I remember when a man could get his cock clean for five bucks.
I'll clean your cock for five bucks, but a blowjob is still fifty.
Let me call my wife.
Hey, there he is.
- Dennis.
- How do you feel?
Did you come in a convertible?
Don't be iealous.
- Get a drink.
- All right.
Have a good time.
It's your last chance.
Hey, Ed, what is the "Elect Zinna" bullshit?
Fucking bitch.
What happened to you?
While I was getting a blowjob the other whore punched my whore in the mouth.
You better ice that shit, money.
Hey, thanks so much for putting this together.
I'm having a fucking great time.
Don't wory about it, brother.
Hey, listen, Manganelli just showed up.
Yeah, I saw him.
No fight, please.
I promise!
Listen, Maz, I'm in a vey different place right now.
- I really don't care about Manganelli.
- That's what I want to hear.
- All right?
- That's great, Artie.
Okay, now, all hoors front and center!
Time to rape the bachelor!
Come on!
I'm not doing it!
I'm not doing it!
- I'm not doing it!
- Tough shit.
You're doing it!
- Have at him, ladies.
- You're a liar, you motherfucker.
No!
Please!
Maz is getting his pipes cleaned.
Hang in there, Maz.
Maz, you're down for the count, bro.
Jesus Christ.
Artie?
Artie?
Artie?
Hey, I'm a little busy right now.
I thought you said you're not gonna do coke anymore.
Bachelor parties don't count.
Asshole, it's Gina's father.
I would rather not be naked in front of my friends right now.
Shit.
He looks pissed.
I was hoping he'd be cool.
You know, like your father was in your bachelor party.
Yeah, he was the best.
I can't believe I walked in on him getting a hummer.
What?
Nothing.
Hey, this dude looks like he's going to freak out.
I better go talk to him.
I'm supposed to go to confession new week.
Cheap shit.
I don't know if you guys know this, but I'm getting married vey soon.
Hello, sir.
No, please!
I have a child.
I have a five-year-old.
Wow!
Boy, Maz has a big cock.
I'm going to kill you, you motherfucker!
He's got no respect for his elders.
Get off him!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Get off him!
Hey, thanks for letting me do bumps with you.
You want that blowiob now?
No, I'm good.
That's a first.
She must be pretty special.
Yeah, she is.
Bye.
Take care.
Art, Maz is pissing all over himself behind the bar.
Well, it's not a bachelor party unless somebody pisses his pants.
Actually, he managed to get it out of his pants.
Look, Maz, I know I owe you for that time you helped me out... when I shit my pants on Mardi Gras, but now we're even, man.
Wow!
How much did you drink, motherfucker?
Jesus Christ, Maz!
Maz!
All right, it looks like the well is running dy finally.
Now, if you could just get your dick back to your pants on your own... eveything will be fine, all right, man?
Hey, DeVanzo.
I know why you're here, but I'm not letting you blow Maz.
Of course not.
That's your job, you son of a bitch.
In case you haven't notice, the party is over.
Get out.
All right, I'm going.
Say hi to Linda for me.
What?
Linda Salvo, your girlfriend.
She didn't tell you she used to go to my gym?
No.
Yeah.
Cute girl.
She earned quite a few free membership months in my office... if you know what I mean.
Anmay, say hi to her for me.
Hey, honey.
You look like you haven't slept a wink.
I taped the Yankee game for you.
Thanks.
So, were you naughty at the bachelor party?
Actually, I wasn't.
Linda, I have something important I want to ask you.
Really?
What is it?
Did you fuck Manganelli?
Artie...
Just answer the question, please.
Look, I don't want to talk about this, okay?
I just...
No matter what you think, it's not important.
Could you just answer the fucking question, please?
All right.
The answer is yes.
Fuck!
How could you?
Artie, it was over two years ago!
Right, and I had to hear about it from him.
Why couldn't you tell me yourself?
How could I?
You're completely consumed with this guy.
You're finally just starting to get over it.
Look, I don't think about this jerk... and I don't want you to think about him either.
All right?
I just want us to be happy like we are.
Come on.
This is too fucked up.
I don't think I can handle it.
What do you mean you don't think you can handle it?
What?
You want to break up over this?
You know what?
Yeah, I do.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Over something that happened years before I met you?
You feel bad so now you want to make me feel bad too, right?
God, you're lust...
You're not a man!
You're a fucking little bitch.
God, you're fucking unbelievable!
I could fucking kill you!
Damn Yankees fuck ass!
Nasty loser ass!
Take your stinking loser jersey too!
Fat fuck!
Fucking asshole!
Can I get some more fries here, Rhonda?
You know, women who date fat guys are often mentally unstable.
Yeah, it's true.
They call them "chubby chasers".
- Rhonda, I'm still here.
- One order of fries coming up.
Asshole!
Asshole!
Asshole!
I'm telling you, this chick is good for Artie.
- I got my own problems.
- Thanks for the free bat, asshole.
Hey, Art, you know what?
You can't hold this on this chick now.
I mean I know it's a pain in the ass to deal with it...
I can't deal with it.
It's over.
This is the first chick you've ever been serious about.
Come on, you finally met a broad who doesn't care about your drinking... or the fact you're 35 years old and you still live with your mom.
And she doesn't mind that a man with your weight should be about 6'2".
Plus you factor in the herpes thing and...
Asshole!
Enough!
Me and her are through.
So now who are you going to take to my wedding... if there is one?
What do you mean if there still is one?
You know, Art, I asked you not to let things get crazy at the bachelor party.
Now I got to be worried, you know?
I'm afraid Gina's father is going to tell her what went on there.
No, he's not.
Yeah, how do you know?
He's not going to break the bachelor party code.
No man tells a woman what goes on at a bachelor party.
So what happened at Michael's bachelor party?
Nothing.
So what went on at Maz's bachelor party?
Nothing.
So what went on at the bachelor party?
Nothing, baby.
We've been married for 43 years and you still won't tell me what goes on... at one bachelor party?
Fuck off.
No, I'm going to be honest with Gina.
I'll feel better if I just tell her what happened.
- Are you fucking insane?
- No, no, no, asshole!
Evey once in a while, some moronic pussy does spill the beans... and it's always a disaster.
Forgive me!
Please, don't go!
I'll die without you!
Get away from me, you whore-lover.
You said you watched porno so you wouldn't have to do things like that.
Look, I wish I hadn't done it... but I'm insecure and it feels like it's going to fall off.
If it doesn't, give me a call and I'll come back and I'll cut it off!
Cut what off, mommy?
- I know.
I know.
- Here he comes, here it goes.
It's a pe_ect day for softball here at the stadium.
55 thousand on hand for Johnny Trinno.
Bobblehead Day here.
I mean it's a great day for the kids.
All fans 16 and under will get one.
And can Johnny go for the.700 batting average?
- Do you ever shut the fuck up?
- No, I don't.
.698.
- Nice one, baby!
- Go, Johnny!
- Come on, Artie.
- Big stick, Artie.
Would you look at Artie.
You know, he really thinks who he is.
Fucking best man at my wedding.
And he better behave.
Gina, you've got to stop.
Stop worying.
- Marilyn, stop worying?
- Yeah.
Did you know that at Donna Delvecchio's wedding... he pissed in the centerpieces and got the priest high?
Okay.
Oscar Gamble stile, baby.
Way to go, fuckhead.
Yeah!
Yes, Artie!
Way to go, Artie.
I knew you could do it, pal.
We did it!
So back during college basketball season... my buddy Scheky tells me he's got this system.
He says it's an absolute lock when you have this combination, right?
Big East team on the road... give them less than six points with a white point guard, all right?
So I bet St. John's against Duke and I lose big...
I mean, really big, right?
So I said to Scheky, I go, "Look, man... the only time a white point guard is a good thing... is when your sister tells you she's dating a point guard."
Hey, Tim, I didn't see you there, man.
That's a funny ioke, man.
You like that ioke?
Yeah, what's not to like about it?
It's about how you guys suck at basketball... and how good we fuck your women.
I never thought about it like that.
- We got a better lineup than they got.
- Totally.
That's why they slacked off the second half.
He got the champagne...
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!
- What's up?
How you doing?
- Hey, Art, listen to this.
Carino Autobody lost to Muchugrasso Overhead Doors... so now we're tied for second with Carino.
- Hey, our last game is against Carino!
- That's right.
It's going to come down to the last day here.
Does Ed's Bar and Swill win the right to face Manganelli in the championship... and save the team?
Or perhaps even more dramatic... does Joking Johnny Trinno bat.700?
Asshole, will you forget about your batting average for one second?
We gotta beat that prick Manganelli.
Artie, what exactly do you have against my cousin?
Well, number one, he's a prick.
Number two, he's a cock.
Number three, he's a dick.
Congratulations, you know three different words for "penis".
Four, now that you taught me "penis".
All right, guys, relax, okay?
Does anybody need a drink?
- Eveybody be nice.
- All right, let's change the subject.
Artie, are you bringing Linda to the wedding or are you guys still broken up?
No, we're broken up for good.
You know, Gina actually offered to set you up with one of her cousins.
Hey, great!
I heard your cousin Manganelli gives a mean blowjob.
You know what, Artie?
You sit on this and rotate.
Gina, your flirting is making eveyone at the table uncomfortable.
Come on, Art, take it down a notch.
she's just tying to help you.
Hey, I'm not some loser who can't get a...
Wait, you're not talking about your cousin Tracy with the tits?
No, Tracy's married now, thank you.
Hey, I'm not some loser who can't get a date!
I'm doing just fine on my own.
Hello, is Karen Denver there?
Karen?
It's Artie DeVanzo!
Yeah, Artie, from Union High!
That's right, we haven't spoken since I took you to the prom.
That's right, I did call you from jail after.
Well, listen, I was just sitting in the office here... and I was wondering...
Do you remember my friend Maz?
Yeah, well, he's getting married this weekend... and I was wondering if you want_ td go with me.
Yeah, I was remembering all the fun times we used to have.
What do you mean "what fun"?
By my count, we banged at least 26 times.
Hello?
No kidding, Gigi.
You're strictly into chicks now?
Hey, did I have something to do with that?
I did?
So then you got divorced from that guy too?
Boy, Brenda, you really know how to pick them.
I'm lust teasing you.
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
It's really great to talk to you too.
I'm so glad that nerd at the libray taught me how to Google.
Listen, let me tell you why I'm calling...
You know already?
Really?
Right, I did tell you I'd pay you back that 200 bucks I borrowed from you... no matter how long it took.
Hi, this is Linda.
I can't come to the phone right now, so, please, leave me a message.
Hey, it's Artie.
I know we haven't talked in awhile, so this is kind of aw_ard... but...
Look, eveything was my fault.
I know I get crazy sometimes you know and... well...
I don't know, listen...
I'm going to stop talking into your machine before this gets embarrassing.
Give me a call if you get a chance.
But I miss you.
I miss you a lot.
Bye.
So, you're going to call him?
I don't know.
I mean I still really care about Artie, but he really hurt me.
Either way, keep this quiet, because it was a big mistake.
Why?
Because I'm black?
No, because you're fucking married!
All right, my bad.
What do you say now, Dave?
Hang in there.
- Hang in there.
- Land her, baby.
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.
Bring the ball.
Come on, Dave.
Run him on now.
Come on!
Strike three!
Oh, my God!
I can't wait to go home and get high!
Holy shit.
Some of the greats strike out, Dave.
That's right, striking out in slow pitch softball is nothing to be ashamed of.
All right, Johnny.
All right, Johnny!
It's all you, baby!
Bring me in.
Two outs here in the last inning, with the winning run on second.
Who would you want up more than Johnny Trinno?
It's been a magical year for Johnny... as he comes to the last game with a.699 average.
All right, come on, it's getting dark.
Yet Trinno's star shines as bright as ever.
Nice hit, Johnny!
That's it.
Come on, Maz, go!
Screw your slide!
Go, come on, slide, slide!
Your slide!
Head for a slide!
Head for a slide!
Shit.
What did you slide for?
They didn't even throw the ball.
Why the hell did you tell me to slide?
I was just fucking with you.
We're in the championship!
Listen, Johnny, I don't have a date for the wedding yet.
What?
I thought you took care ofthat.
The wedding is this afternoon.
I know, I struck out all over the place.
Hey, do you think Marilyn... could get one of her friends to go with me last minute?
Look, Art, Marilyn's female friends are all lawyers, bankers and executives...
So what are you saying, that they're too good for me?
No, no, I was tying to let the silence say it for me.
Artie, even if Marilyn could help you, it's too late.
Nobody cares if you have a date.
Just come by yourself.
I can't do that, Johnny.
That's all right, man.
I still got one chick left I could call.
It's almost time to get it started.
Where the hell is Artie?
I just called the house.
His mom said some girl came and picked him up.
What the...?
I don't believe this shit!
Look, Johnny, if this scumbag isn't here in five minutes... we start without him.
You step in as best man.
Yes, sir.
That's so sad that you and your girlfriend broke up.
You're such a sweetie.
Here.
You want a bump to cheer you up?
No, that's all right.
Maybe later.
You know you just flew through a stop sign, right?
Who are you to talk, silly?
You don't even have a driver's license.
Well, at least we're making good time.
All right, the church is like two minutes from here... so, just go straight, but slow down.
Slow down!
Slow down!
Pitching Machine, look out!
I saved us!
Yeah, you're a real hero.
Come on, let's go.
Wait, let me powder my nose.
Fuck me.
Hey, DeVanzo, you're free to go.
Hey, what time is it?
Five a.m..
Shit!
- Look, I know I messed up.
- Messed up...
All right, screwed up.
fucked up!
- I really am sory.
- Stop, all right?
Don't even...
We've been friends for 30 years.
You're my best man.
How could you miss my wedding?
What the hell is the matter with you?
Man, I'm sory.
Well, I'm not.
At least the fucking Pitching Machine... didn't end up on my wedding.
Look, I don't know how many times I have to say this... but I really am sory!
You know, those words, they have no meaning coming from you... all right?
They're shit.
I've had enough of your "I'm sorys" to last my lifetime.
"I'm sory I missed your wedding."
I'm sory I started that fight with Manganelli.
I'm sory I got drunk and stole your dad's ice cream truck."
I mean I could go on...
Wait, the ice cream truck thing I was 12 years old.
Yeah, and you haven't changed a bit!
You selfish prick!
You even manage to make my wedding about you.
Obviously you don't want to be around me and don't blame you.
I'm going to quit the team.
Team?
What team?
We're going to lose the championship and then the team's over because of you... so don't go fucking talking to me about the team, all right?
- What the fuck?
- What...
- Hey, it's Dirt!
- Dirt!
- Johnny.
- Man, hury up!
Call an ambulance.
Dirt?
Dirt?
We need an ambulance here at the Tamblin Field.
- Shit, Dirt.
- Hang on, we're getting help.
- I can't believe you really did it.
- He always said that's what he wanted.
I want to go out lust like that.
Gentlemen, later today we're playing for the championship... and for the survival of Ed's Bar and Swill softball team.
But right now I want to do a toast... to a fallen friend and a teammate, Dirt... the greatest softball pitcher of all time.
To Dirt.
- Dirt.
- Dirt.
Hey, Ed, what do you say?
Set up some more.
To be honest, if Dirt hasn't died...
I wouldn't even be talking to you right now... but I still don't want our friendship to end, all right?
Me neither, man.
Look, Maz, this ain't a good excuse... but I just couldn't show up to your wedding... in front of fucking Manganelli without a date.
It would have been too humiliating after that thing with Linda.
Artie, don't let that prick get to you.
That's what fucks eveything up.
That's when you become the asshole.
I want to beat him in softball too.
And ends there.
You can't let that guy ruin your whole freaking life.
I know, I know.
You're right, man.
You're right.
I mean, you got to let it go.
And if he doesn't, you should.
Fuck it.
I'm just going to let it go.
I'm done worying about Dennis Manganelli.
All right.
Thanks for talking to me like this, man.
You'd do the same thing for me, you know?
No, I would have went behind your back telling eveyone what a dick you were.
Hey, lovebirds... sory to interrupt your little date over there... but we're toasting Dirt.
Your shots are accumulating.
All right, all right, we're coming.
Not to much drinking.
We got a championship game in two hours.
I know.
Let's just drink one toast to Dirt.
To the greatest rock and roll band of all time...
Molly Hatchett.
Fucking all right.
Watch.
I'm going to place this pe_ectly.
Asshole.
Ed, another round of tequila.
You guys finished all my tequila.
Dave drank the last bottle by himself.
Last night I had a dream that I killed evey single one of you guys.
Relax, Dave.
Hey!
Easy, Dave.
Come on!
Hey, what time is it?
Holy shit, its almost game time.
We got to go.
Eveybody got their bats and gloves in their trunk, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, just got to go home and get my uniform.
- Yeah, me too.
- We ain't got time.
If we're two seconds late, Manganelli's going to call for a fo_eit.
We got to go straight to the field.
- One more drink and then we'll go.
- No, no, we got to leave right now.
Come on.
You riding with me, Art?
Thanks, man.
Let's go, eveybody!
Come on, let's go!
I can't let nine guys drive out of here drunk.
Well, I'm riding with Maz, so it's really just eight.
- Come on, I'm fine.
- We do it evey weekend.
I can't let you guys drive out of here all shimmed up.
Jeez.
Well, then you have to drive all of us.
Open the door before I shove that stupid fucking cooler up your ass.
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!
What the fuck?
Let's move!
Man, both my legs are asleep.
Both my balls are asleep.
I don't want to hear about your balls.
Hail May, full of grace...
Don't pray like that, all right?
God hates Guidos.
Shit!
It looks like the circus with all the clowns coming out of the car.
Where's Dave?
Did we forget Dave?
Anybody bring any weed?
I left mine at the funeral home.
Play ball!
Oh, Christ.
I'm going to fucking die out here.
I'm fucked up, bro.
Bourbon and tequila?
Come on, Art.
All right, let's look intelligent!
Look alive.
Get ready to lose!
And here comes DeVanzo.
He's a sandy-haried, slender-thighed... long-legged, big beautiful young man... with excellent bone structure.
The pussy he must get on the road.
Hey, look.
Drunk rookie pitcher on the mound.
We're going to destroy you.
You've never even pitched before.
No, but ifyou would do it, it can't be that hard, bro.
Come on.
DeVanzo wheels, deals, rocks, kicks the up ring.
What the fuck are we doing here?
- You have done that before, haven't you?
- Shut up!
I'm still going to strike you out.
A_!
A_!
Don't let him get to you.
Come on.
Well.
Well.
Beautiful.
Ball four.
Take you base.
Yeah, I got a feeling he will be saying that a lot today.
Come on, Art.
Shit, it's going to be a long game, bro.
All right, don't wory, don't wory.
He'll settle in.
Hey, Art.
Come on, Art.
Come on, Artie, focus.
Come on.
Yeah!
Double play!
Yeah!
Come on, Johnny.
Get it!
Get it!
Shit!
Shit!
This is the longest day of your life, Artie.
Run!
Run!
Home!
Home!
Run, Dennis!
Run!
Jeez!
Oh, God.
I'm good.
Come on, Dennis.
Come on, Dennis.
You're out!
And who's got a Percoset?
All right, here we go!
All right.
That's me, right at!
Fucking asshole.
You're out!
Ba_ly rules!
Come on, Bobby.
Place it.
Asshole.
God, I'm glad Dirt ain't around to see this.
You're out!
You're out.
Thought the tank was empty.
- They keep doing this to themselves.
- I know.
Here you go.
- Here you go, guys, coffee.
- Help yourselves.
Thanks a lot.
Jimmy needed this.
Yeah, coffee.
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.
You smell like booze.
- It gets you hot, though.
- Actually, it does.
Thanks for the coffee, honey.
10-O.
They're killing us.
Last at bat.
I'm sory.
- Hey, Gina.
- Hey, Artie.
I'm really sory about missing your wedding.
Listen, don't wory about it.
You not showing up was the best gift I got.
The only disaster was Johnny's toast.
What?
He said it went great.
So to recap, throughout it all there's been a lot of laughter and a few tears.
But in the end, the clouds parted, the sun shined down... and the good Lord himself decided it was meant to be.
That's how I finished the regular season batting.706.
Salud.
What do we say, Dennis?
Come on, Dennis.
We're right behind you.
Out.
Damn, now bourbon, tequila and coffee.
Two away!
DeVanzo shift!
Well, you're down 10-O... and you're going to make your team's last out ever.
How's that feel, alcoholic?
Hury up and pitch, asshole.
I'm losing my buzz.
What do you say, Artie?
What do you say?
Hey, Artie?
What?
Come here.
Hey, Linda.
Hey, sweetie.
How's it going?
What's up?
Artie, you're a fucking ierk.
I know.
Unfortunately, that seems to be my go-to move.
But I really miss you.
I miss you too.
You want to talk after the game?
Let's talk now and make this jerk-offs wait.
Hey, Linda?
I'll meet you in my office at the gym after the game.
Shut the fuck up, Needle Dick!
And thanks for the herpes!
- Ball bag.
- What an asshole.
- Asshole.
- Jerk-off.
This town is 980/o skanks.
That's my girl.
Let's go.
Batter up!
- I'll see you after the game, all right?
- Okay.
Bye.
- Come on.
- Come on!
Get the fuck in, you lazy fuck.
Classy broad you got there, bro.
Thanks, Needle Dick.
Put it up there, Dennis.
He can't hit it.
- Come on.
- Here we go.
Here we go.
No.
- Yeah.
Get out.
- Come on!
- Yeah!
- What?
Fuck!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hell of a shot, bro!
Son of a bitch, motherfucker, bastard, asshole!
Nice shot, Artie.
Hey, you assholes knock that off... or I'm revoking your gym memberships!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
- Nice shot!
- That's right!
At least you got some revenge on that prick Manganelli... even if we're not going to win.
What the fuck are you talking about?
We're going to win.
Art, it's 10-1.
We're down to our last out.
I don't give a fuck.
Anyone who thinks we're going to lose can go home right now!
Hey, calm down, will you?
Would Dirt calm down if he were here?
No.
After my homer he would have thrown a bat at my head... for not running around the bases harder.
Now this is the last inning.
Let's get some runs and take that fucking troll!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Come on now!
Nice!
Nice going, Maz!
Run, you motherfucker!
Nice!
Nice!
All right.
Come on, Dave.
What do you say?
Come on, Dave.
Let's go.
- Come on, bring it!
- Yeah, that's right.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Holy shit, Dave got a hit.
Holy living Christ.
Lucky shot.
Come on, Albert.
Yeah!
Come on!
- Shit!
- Cocksucker!
Damn!
Now we're looking like a team!
Yeah!
Stay on the bag, Dave.
Come on, guys.
Keep it going.
Let's go!
Come on!
Come on, Daryl.
Nice swing.
Run!
Run, Dave, come on!
It's a gapper!
It's a gapper, come on!
Shit!
Asshole!
Yes!
Get me a beer, somebody, come on!
You're up, you're up, you're up.
Yeah!
Yeah!
What do you say, Dave?
Nice!
Like a gazelle, buddy!
Like a gazelle running out there.
What do you say, Alfonse?
Come on, one time!
We need you, buddy!
Nice, Alphonse!
Run!
Run, you sweaty Guido!
Run!
Come on!
Yeah!
Tim, get out there.
Come on, we need you, buddy.
Run, run!
Do this, you sweaty... 9Uy.
Sweet!
Sweet!
Run!
Run, you crazy motherfucker!
Run, come on!
There you go, man!
One time, Johnny.
Hey, Manganelli, you're looking good, shitnuts.
We're rocking you, you pansy ass.
It's so unfair.
It's like pitching to a healthy Lou Gehrig.
Yeah!
Fuck!
Let's go!
Get it in here!
DeVanzo shift.
We're one out away from the championship.
Force at any base.
One more bum and they're done.
You pricks stay awake out there, God damn it.
Don't wory about the shift, Art.
We're down 10-6.
Just put it over the wall, we tie it up.
Let's go!
Come on, Artie!
Give it a ride, brother.
Come on!
Come on, big stick up there, Artie.
Let's go!
You can beat this guy.
He fucking blows.
Your attention, please.
Ladies and gentlemen... now pitching for Manganelli... number one, Needle Dick.
- Number one.
- Yeah, all right.
Needle Dick.
Shut the fuck up!
Your luck's run out, DeVanzo.
This is your last at bat in this league forever!
I'm going to have to remodel the window of my gym... to fit that fifth trophy, but fuck it, right?
Let's go!
For the last time, you're not getting that trophy.
Come on, hit it out, baby!
Come on, hit it out, fuckhead!
Prepare to continue you lifetime losing streak, jerk-off.
Bring it on.
Stay cool, Artie.
Stay cool.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, Dennis.
Let's go.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Come on, show what you can do.
Get the ball!
Hury.
Come on!
Come on, run!
Hury!
Let's go!
Run!
Get the fucking ball!
Yeah!
Artie, run!
Run!
Come on, throw it!
Home!

Come on, Artie.
Shit!
Get it!
Score, Artie, score!
You're going to score!
- Dive!

- Dive!
- Dive!
- Dive!
- Dive!
You're out!
God!
Shit!
Yeah, you're the one, baby!
Hey, you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
It was a hell of a game.
Good hustle.
Great shit.
Hey, guys, this can't be our last game.
Let's go play in Parsippany new year.
- I'm in.
- Yeah!
- Me too, man.
- Let's do it.
You know what?
Fuck it.
You're right.
We got to play again new year.
I'm in!
I'm in!
Let's go get drunk.
That sounds great, but there's one thing I gotta do first.
Hey, Linda, pull the car around.
Okay, Artie.
My dear Lord.
- We did it!
- We won!
- We're the best!
- Hurray!
Get a photographer over here!
Take a picture of the champs.
Yeah, let's get a photogra...
Get that fat fuck!
Artie, what the fuck are you doing?
DeVanzo, you're dead this time!
Let's go, Linda.
I want that piece of shit killed.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Go.
See you at the gym, fellows!
Come back here, you fucking loser.
That was the greatest asshole move ever.
Absolutely.
God help DeVanzo when I get my hands on him.
Hey!
Hey, kid!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Just updating your photo, Mayor Herpes.
- Shit!
- Come back here, you little brat!
Help!
This maniac is tying to give me fucking herpes.
Come back here, you wise-ass.
I told that prick he wasn't get that trophy.
You're such a pisser, Artie.
What are you going to do with that crazy thing?
You know what?
Drive over Manganelli's gym.
I'll put a note on the trophy saying I'm sory... and then I'll throw it through his front fucking window.
God, Artie, please, don't do that.
I was just kidding.
Hey, let's pawn it in Newa_... then go down the shore and get cheese sticks.
- Count me in.
- All right.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm sory.
Do you know what time it is?
Do you know what time it is?
- I guess I do.
- Yes.
Wow!
Those are really pretty colo_ul shoes you got there.
And they show off your colorful nails.
Thanks.
Hey, do you like music?
Who doesn't like music?
That's true.
Do you like rock music?
I could take it or leave it.
Because my friend band, I know the guitar from this band... and they're playing later.
I think I can get you on the guest list.
And we could split the other ticket or...
Hey, beat it, dirtbag.
Get lost.
Did you want to go?
What the fuck?
Get lost.
- Jesus.
- Jesus Christ.
I'm gone for like two minutes and they're like vultures.
Two minutes?
You're gone for 20 minutes.
The line on the cheese steak was like an hour long.
I'm sory.
You want a bite?
- Have a bite.
Come on.
- All right.
What do you say, batter?
Batter to DeVanzo at first.
He's got it.
Up with it.
Here.
Down here.

Hey, now!
Bitch.
- Complete jerk-off.
- "I want to be honest with it.
I want to be honest with my wife."
- Shut the fuck up.
- Asshole.
This Danish is stale.
The happiest day of my life is gonna be when you finally have a kid.
God bless, that means I got laid at least once.
Laying down a bunt is like holding your dick and putting it in.
Okay?
Softly.
Hey, mom, do we have Fluffernutter?
- Mom!
- I'm looking!
Fluffernutter!
See if we have any Fluffernutter!
She's losing her hearing.
I'm wory about her healthy.
You know, the happiest days...
"Happy Days"?
You were on "Happy Days"?
- Yes, I was.
I'm Chachi.
- Okay.
Line.
- A priest and a rabbi...
- No, no, no.
- A...
- No, no, no.
What are you doing?
- What's this line?
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.
Is that the line?
I have no idea.
That's the Jersey City salute?
That's the Jersey City salute to Manganelli, sweetheart!
Your shitnuts!

Bolivia then.
Or one of the "guay"s.
Para, Uru.

Why?
Why do we have to leave?
Because...
I stole 1.3 million dollars worth of poker chips from a casino in Canada.
An Abumchuk is not just a bounty hunter but he's also an ultimate fighter.
But don't worry, I have a plan.
We'll go down to South America, we find this guy Elmet, a serious gambler.
He'll buy the chips for 34 cents on the dollar
And we'll get a little casita, and have babies.
I always know exactly when I'm ovulating.
Oh my God!
We'll leave today after graduation.
I'll make a Waldorf salad for the road, or a corn salad.
I make a great corn salad.
Do you have a cooler?
You know,
I haven't forgotten how you stabbed me screaming "die shitile, die".
You stepped on my spirit turtle.
You are bat-shit nuts, Kat.
And I love that about you but I've never meant for you to find me again.
And I cannot go away with you.
You know how I hate to travel alone.
I wanna lick the space where your toes used to be.
I know you do, I know.
Oh God!
That's it, right there, right there...
Son of a bitch.
Son of a fucking cold bitch!
Silas, it's me, again.
I'm offering you amnesty if you come home in the next hour.
Probation, if you show up for graduation.
At the very least, please, let me know you're okay.
Wow!
You look very handsome.
Are we moving?
Why won't you let me get through today and then ask me about that again tomorrow, okay?
Is Silas coming to my graduation?
I'm not sure about that.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
What do I tell people when they ask what you do?
You tell them I'm your mom.
I've been doing some research on the Internet and I really think Pittsburgh is the place for us.
I'll keep that in mind.
- Pittsburgh.
OK.
- Pittsburgh.
- Good morning.
- Good morning what?

No, I spilled!
I'll go get the paper towels.
Honey, relax.
It's just a little milk.

Mom's not here.
She'll be back.
No, honey.
Not this time, really.
Come on.
Dad, you know that Harry Potter's books that we've read?
Love them all!
Love Harry Potter.
Mom is Voldemort.
Don't you know that?
You may have reduced her to vapor know but she is out there, gathering her strength.
And she will be back.
Don't you know that?
You'd better get ready for graduation.
Big day today.
Big day!
Silas, we're leaving for graduation now.
I hope you'll meet us there.
This is really important to Shane.
Really.
Don't do this to him.
Jesus, you scared me!
Good.
I hope you peed your panties.
- Where is he?
- Who?
Oh right, I guess you had to ask that.
"Who, Celia?"
The one who called you a drunk at a public assembly or the one who stole civic property.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I have Silas on video, stealing.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh not today!
Mom, we're gonna be late.
Where the hell did you get a gun?
I borrowed it from Pam.
Oh my God!
I only had the one bullet.
I was gonna shoot Doug.
I'll see you at graduation.
Are you okay?
This would had never happened in Pittsburgh.
Why am I even here?
I heard you might be meeting your maker today.
So we figured we send that boy off to die with a nice hot breakfast in his belly.
What do you know?
What do we know?
Vaneeta?
What do we know?
Is the baby too little for a blueberry?
No.
But you give it to him cut it up real small.
And put a bib on 'cause that shit won't stain.
Heylia got a little visit from your girlfriend.
I told her not to come to y'all.
Ain't nobody listening to you Conrad.
He come after you?
Yeah.
He gonna want to finish it.
Probably.
Let me ask you this.
You want to die today?
No.
Eat your fucking waffle.
Greetings Agrestic Elementary school, class of 2006.
Hello teachers, parents, step-parents, siblings, boyfriends and girlfriends of parents assorted relatives, friends of your mom and dad you call aunt and uncle and really aren't.
And... principle Dodge.
As I stand before you today, on the brink of junior high, here is what I have to say.
You have failed us all!
Everything is not okay!
We have becomed alienated, desensitized, angry and frightened.
If we picture Agrestic as an airplane, a grand soaring jet carrying us through the sky,
I think you all need to understand :
there are motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane.
OK, that's it, Botwin.
That is quite enough!
We said no profanity.
You are done.
Here is your diploma and you are Agrestic Junior High's problem now.
Ladies and Gentlemen it's time to give out the diplomas.
Let him speak!
Motherfucking let him motherfucking speak!
I will call off this graduation if we don't have order right now!
I mean it!
Everybody keep quiet!
You're not safe.
You moved here so that you'd feel safe but your children are not safe.
I have to go.
Take Shane to the party and I'll see you guys later.
Tell Shane I'm sorry I had to go.
- Where you going?
- It's business.
Where are you going?
Congratulations, you've all graduated.
Goodbye!
Just making sure you were coming.
We both know how you lie.
Either you control your woman or I will.
I hear you.
I'm cutting in.
Are you my boyfriend or not?
I liberated a case of Cactus Cola for the ride.
- I'm not going with you.
- Tastes like baby aspirin.
Oh, well, in that case I'm still not going.
Jesus, you scared me.
You oughta let a person know you're coming.
I was gonna cut you up into 7 little men holding hands.
Did you hear from our friend?
Yeah, he left a note on my car, he's trying to scare me.
- Is it working?
- Fuck, yes!
You're a good kisser.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
What's oh shit?
Abumchuck.
It's now or never, come with me.
I can't be alone and you're my favorite person on Earth.
I can't do it, Kat.
Fine, fuck you.
Give me your van keys.
- You can't have my van.
- I'm just gonna steal it anyway.
Fine.
Wife fucker.
Career wrecker.
You punched my neck.
You're freakishly tall.
I'm also freakishly long so imagine how much of me was inside your wife.
Come here.
Did you hear my speech?
- Uh... no, I missed it.
- You're an asshole.
Look, I'm sorry.
Okay?
I had stuff to do.
Where's mom?
I don't know she took off during my speech.
Did she say where she was going?
No, she just left.
Some fucking family you got stuck with, huh?
Hey, what's up?
Man, you're coming in real time or you're coming in black people time?
Alright, we'll be here.
Black people time?
It's almost like water mellons.
Some of us got dicks, most of us got trouble getting places on time.
I get it.
I like gin and I'm not much for hugging.
Did you bring a gun?
Actually, that's one cultural stereotype that I am not fulfilling today.
I brought a gun.
Celia left it at my house this morning after she shot my kitchen cabinet.
Jesus!
Give me that fucking thing!
There aren't any bullets in it.
Another great plan from you.
Shouldn't put metal in microwave.
Hi, honey, I got your note.
Sure know how to charm a girl.
You've been fucking him the whole time you were married to me?
- No, I told you that.
- But you're a liar.
It's just business between us.
Always has been.
Well, your loss.
She fucks like a wild animal.
Hey, guys...
Oh... isn't it my shift?
You're the little shit who smashed my muffin.
Forgive me?
If you let go, I will kill you!
I will kill you!
I will kill you, you son of a bitch!
Alright, now you're dead!
Now you are fucking dead!
I have no respect for you personally.
But I always thought you were cute.
And I'm single now.
By the way, have you seen your nephew?
Never mind.
Suit looks good.
I'll be in touch.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Jesus, people are so rude in he South.
Well, that's it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're broken up.
Sorry, kid.
He's a... heartbreaker that one.
Yeah, well, maybe they deserve each other.
Who?
Shane and Kat.
Yeah, well, she's gone.
I know.
They left together.
They...
Shit!
When?
Few minutes ago.
The two of them took off.
Yo, motherfuckers!
Anybody home?
Big bad wolf's coming in.
I'll be waiting in my truck.
Open, fucking little piggies!
You're out too.
Not with him.
Somebody gotta answer the door.
Hold up!
Okay.
Don't come out of here.
No matter what.
Don't come out, okay?
Oh hey.
It's about time.
I was just about to huff and puff.
Some nice setup you got here.
Now take off your shirt.
- What?
- Take off your fucking shirt.
Come on, check Conrad for a wire.
She's mine.
- Hold up, dog.
That's bullshit.
- It's called due dilligent.
You're gonna do the dilligent or am I?
It's dilligence.
Nice titties.
Okay, I've shown you mine.
Now show me yours.
In a minute, I gotta pee.
Where's your fucking toilet?
Doing that maple lemonade fast.
Flushes you out.
Pees more than my cousin Jerome who only got one kidney.
Poor Jerome.
We are gonna have the best adventure.
Thanks for keeping me company, Shane.
Cactus cola?
Where are we going?
Where do you wanna go?
- Pittsburgh!
- Okay.
But we have to make a quick stop in Paraguay first.
Cool!
Tastes like baby aspirin!
Step on it, Geronimo!
You watch that shit, man.
Yes?
No, no, no, no.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Kashishian says goodbye.
I've been on this flush.
Yeah.
Maple lemonade.
My kid's graduating so um... can we just get through this?
Give us the money, we give you the drugs, everybody goes away.
You don't see the cash until I see the weed.
Come on, help me with it.
Open 'em.
No.
You don't see the weed until I see the cash.
You know what?
You're almost right about that.
What the fuck?
Yeah, now give us the drugs and we'll let you live.
Open her up.
Where's the money?
Ain't no money, fool.
I'm a fucking criminal.
Now open up the safe 'fore I shoot both of y'all.
I hear you, you're a wonderful criminal.
- Bitch!
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What the hell are you thinking, dog?
I'm thinking you ain't got no army.
Oh... shit.
And right now business is business, home boy.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What the fuck?
Where is the money?
The negro lady say I kill agent Asshole, you pay us.
He's dead?
Where is my money, Conrad?
We ran into a little problem.
There ain't no money 'cause they decided to jack us.
Son of a bitch!
Motherfucker!
Fine.
We take the pot then.
No way.
That's my shit.
- Why?
You killing federal agent?
- Me killing all y'all.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We all got guns.
Excuse me.
We kill each other then nobody gets nothing.
He's dead?
Peter?
Yes!
Okay, okay.
Sorry, a lot of data floating around.
Will somebody open the fucking safe?
- You gotta pee again?
- Shut the fuck up!
Open the fucking safe!
Nancy...
- Open the fucking safe?
- Okay.
Oh.
Not today.
Ain't no motherfucking weed in here.
- The fuck is this shit?
- Bitch you about to die.
Relax, everybody.
I'm uh...
I'm reaching for my cell phone.
Hold on.
It's ringing.
Hi, Nancy.
Honey... did you take something that doesn't belong to you?
I want in.
That's him.
That's the little fucker who stole my cameras.
Arrest him.
Shit!
Son of a bitch.
Son of a fucking cold bitch.
Silas, it's me again.
I'm offering you amnesty if you come home in the next hour.
Probation, if you show up for graduation.
At the very least, please let me know you're okay.
Wow.
You look very handsome.
Are we moving?
Why don't you let me get through today, and then ask me about that again tomorrow, okay?
Is Silas coming to my graduation?
I'm not sure about that.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
What do I tell people when they ask what you do?
You tell them I'm your mom.
I've been doing some research on the Internet, and I really think Pittsburgh is the place for us.
I'll keep that in mind.
Pittsburgh.
Okay.
Pittsburgh.
- Good morning.
- "Good morning, " what?
Oh, no.
I spilled.
I'll go get the paper towels.
Honey, relax.
It's just a little milk.
- But Mom will totally...
- Mom will what?
- Mom's not here.
- But she'll be back.
No, honey.
Not this time.
Really.
Come on.
Dad, you know the Harry Potter books that we've read?
Love them all.
Love the Harry Potter.
Mom is Voldemort.
Don't you know that?
You may have reduced her to vapor now, but she is out there, gathering her strength, and she will be back.
Don't you know that?
You better get ready for graduation.
Big day today.
Big day.
Silas, we're leaving for graduation now.
I hope you'll meet us there.
This is really important to Shane.
Really.
Don't do this to him.
Oh...
Jesus, you scared me.
Good.
I hope you peed your panties.
- Where is he?
- Who?
Oh, right.
I guess you had to ask that.
"Who, Celia,
"the one who called you a drunk at a public assembly
"or the one who stole civic property?"
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I have Silas on video stealing.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, not today.
Mom, we're gonna be late.
Where the hell did you get a gun?
I borrowed it from Pam.
Oh, my God!
I only had the one bullet.
I was gonna shoot Doug.
I'll see you at graduation.
Are you okay?
This would have never happened in Pittsburgh.
Why am I even here?
I heard you might be meeting your maker today, so we figured,
"Let's send that boy off to die with a nice hot breakfast in his belly."
- What do you know?
- What do we know?
Vaneeta, what do we know?
Is the baby too little for a blueberry?
No, but if you give it to him, cut it up real small.
And put a bib on, 'cause that shit gonna stain.
Heylia got a little visit from your girlfriend.
I told her not to come to you all.
Don't nobody listen to you, Conrad.
He come after you?
- Yeah.
- He gonna want to finish it.
Probably.
Let me ask you this.
You want to die today?
No.
Eat your fucking waffle.
Greetings, Agrestic Elementary School, class of 2006.
Hello, teachers, parents, stepparents, siblings, boyfriends and girlfriends of parents, assorted relatives, friends of your mom and dad who you call aunt and uncle who really aren't, and Principal Dodge.
As I stand before you today on the brink of junior high, here is what I have to say.
You have failed us all!
Everything is not okay!
We have become alienated, desensitized,
angry and frightened.
If we picture Agrestic as an airplane, a grand soaring jet carrying us through the sky,
I think you all need to understand, there are motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane.
Okay.
Okay, that's it, Botwin.
That is quite enough.
You said no profanity.
You are done.
Now, here's your diploma.
And you are Agrestic Junior High's problem now.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to give out the diplomas.
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
Motherfucking let him motherfucking speak!
I will call off this graduation if we don't have order right now!
- I mean it!
- God.
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
- Silence!
I'm not...
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
- Everybody, be quiet.
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
- We are not safe!
You moved here so that you could feel safe, but your children are not safe!
So help me, I will boot you off the stage like a NERF ball.
- I'm not done.
- I have to go.
You can take Shane to the party, and I'll see you guys later.
Tell Shane I'm sorry I had to go.
- Where are you going?
- It's business.
- No.
No, but you...
- Will you turn off this fucking Mike?
Where are you going?
Congratulations, you've all graduated.
Goodbye.
Either you control your woman, or I will.
I hear you.
I'm cutting in.
Are you my boyfriend or not?
I liberated a case of Cactus Cooler for the ride.

Oh, well, in that case, I'm still not going with you.

All right, we'll be here.
Black-people time?
Some of us like watermelon.
Some of us got big dicks.
Most of us have trouble getting places on time.
I get it.
I like gin, and I'm not much for hugging.
Did you bring a gun?
Actually, that's one cultural stereotype that I am not fulfilling today.

I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Listen to me!
You listen to me!
Get off me right now, and I might spare your fucking life!
By the way, have you seen your nephew?
Oh, never mind.
Suit looks good.
I'll be in touch.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Jesus, people are so rude in the South.
Well, that's it.

Of course not.
You never clean anymore.

Look, he decide to steal cameras, not the car stereos and doorknobs.
Why do anyone steal a doorknob?
There are some nice doorknobs.
Lupita,

- What's going to happen to you?
- Nothing, nothing but if something did,

Don't worry about it.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Yeah.
I'm gonna be fine.

I'm not going to Chili with you!

Why?
Why do we have to leave?
Because...
I stole 1.3 million dollars worth of poker chips from a casino in Canada.
An Abumchuk is not just a bounty hunter but he's also an ultimate fighter.
But don't worry, I have a plan.
We'll go down to South America, we find this guy Elmet, a serious gambler.
He'll buy the chips for 34 cents on the dollar
And we'll get a little casita, and have babies.
I always know exactly when I'm ovulating.
Oh my God!
We'll leave today after graduation.
I'll make a Waldorf salad for the road, or a corn salad.
I make a great corn salad.
Do you have a cooler?
You know,
I haven't forgotten how you stabbed me screaming "die shitile, die".
You stepped on my spirit turtle.
You are bat-shit nuts, Kat.
And I love that about you but I've never meant for you to find me again.
And I cannot go away with you.
You know how I hate to travel alone.
I wanna lick the space where your toes used to be.

I had stuff to do.
Where's mom?
I don't know she took off during my speech.
Did she say where she was going?
No, she just left.
Some fucking family you got stuck with, huh?
Hey, what's up?
Man, you're coming in real time or you're coming in black people time?
Alright, we'll be here.
Black people time?
It's almost like water mellons.
Some of us got dicks, most of us got trouble getting places on time.
I get it.
I like gin and I'm not much for hugging.
Did you bring a gun?
Actually, that's one cultural stereotype that I am not fulfilling today.
I brought a gun.
Celia left it at my house this morning after she shot my kitchen cabinet.
Jesus!
Give me that fucking thing!
There aren't any bullets in it.
Another great plan from you.
Shouldn't put metal in microwave.
Hi, honey, I got your note.
Sure know how to charm a girl.
You've been fucking him the whole time you were married to me?
- No, I told you that.
- But you're a liar.
It's just business between us.
Always has been.
Well, your loss.
She fucks like a wild animal.
Hey, guys...
Oh... isn't it my shift?
You're the little shit who smashed my muffin.
Forgive me?
If you let go, I will kill you!
I will kill you!
I will kill you, you son of a bitch!
Alright, now you're dead!
Now you are fucking dead!
I have no respect for you personally.
But I always thought you were cute.
And I'm single now.
By the way, have you seen your nephew?
Never mind.
Suit looks good.
I'll be in touch.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Jesus, people are so rude in he South.
Well, that's it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're broken up.
Sorry, kid.
He's a... heartbreaker that one.
Yeah, well, maybe they deserve each other.
Who?
Shane and Kat.
Yeah, well, she's gone.
I know.
They left together.
They...
Shit!
When?
Few minutes ago.
The two of them took off.
Yo, motherfuckers!
Anybody home?
Big bad wolf's coming in.
I'll be waiting in my truck.
Open, fucking little piggies!
You're out too.
Not with him.
Somebody gotta answer the door.
Hold up!
Okay.
Don't come out of here.
No matter what.
Don't come out, okay?
Oh hey.
It's about time.
I was just about to huff and puff.
Some nice setup you got here.
Now take off your shirt.
- What?
- Take off your fucking shirt.
Come on, check Conrad for a wire.
She's mine.
- Hold up, dog.
That's bullshit.
- It's called due dilligent.
You're gonna do the dilligent or am I?
It's dilligence.
Nice titties.
Okay, I've shown you mine.
Now show me yours.
In a minute, I gotta pee.
Where's your fucking toilet?
Doing that maple lemonade fast.
Flushes you out.
Pees more than my cousin Jerome who only got one kidney.
Poor Jerome.
We are gonna have the best adventure.
Thanks for keeping me company, Shane.
Cactus cola?
Where are we going?
Where do you wanna go?
- Pittsburgh!
- Okay.
But we have to make a quick stop in Paraguay first.
Cool!
Tastes like baby aspirin!
Step on it, Geronimo!
You watch that shit, man.
Yes?
No, no, no, no.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Kashishian says goodbye.
I've been on this flush.
Yeah.
Maple lemonade.
My kid's graduating so um... can we just get through this?
Give us the money, we give you the drugs, everybody goes away.
You don't see the cash until I see the weed.
Come on, help me with it.
Open 'em.
No.
You don't see the weed until I see the cash.
You know what?
You're almost right about that.
What the fuck?
Yeah, now give us the drugs and we'll let you live.
Open her up.
Where's the money?
Ain't no money, fool.
I'm a fucking criminal.
Now open up the safe 'fore I shoot both of y'all.
I hear you, you're a wonderful criminal.
- Bitch!
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What the hell are you thinking, dog?
I'm thinking you ain't got no army.
Oh... shit.
And right now business is business, home boy.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
What the fuck?
Where is the money?
The negro lady say I kill agent Asshole, you pay us.
He's dead?
Where is my money, Conrad?
We ran into a little problem.
There ain't no money 'cause they decided to jack us.
Son of a bitch!
Motherfucker!
Fine.
We take the pot then.
No way.
That's my shit.
- Why?
You killing federal agent?
- Me killing all y'all.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We all got guns.
Excuse me.
We kill each other then nobody gets nothing.
He's dead?
Peter?
Yes!
Okay, okay.
Sorry, a lot of data floating around.
Will somebody open the fucking safe?
- You gotta pee again?
- Shut the fuck up!
Open the fucking safe!
Nancy...
- Open the fucking safe?
- Okay.
Oh.
Not today.
Ain't no motherfucking weed in here.
- The fuck is this shit?
- Bitch you about to die.
Relax, everybody.
I'm uh...
I'm reaching for my cell phone.
Hold on.
It's ringing.
Hi, Nancy.
Honey... did you take something that doesn't belong to you?
I want in.
That's him.
That's the little fucker who stole my cameras.
Arrest him.
Shit!
Previously on Weeds.
I'm having an affair with Doug.
Hey, let's play some more surveillance videos.
No, we can't.
"Drug Free Zone" bandit finally stole my last camera.
Silas.
I'm going to be the class speaker for graduation.
Will you stop hitting on my boyfriend?
- Then why are you with her?
- It's never boring.
Abumchuck.
He's just this bounty hunter.
I did something illegal.
You are no longer welcome in my house.
How did Dana take it?
She would have been devastated.
You didn't do it?
I've been thinking it might be a good idea to...
- Flee?
- Relocate.
You are a drug dealer.
I do not love him.
And I'm never gonna love him.
- He don't know that, right?
- No, I left it okay, I think.
Take your last harvest, get a single buyer, make a quick deal, and then hand all the cash over to me.
And then I want you to make every effort to ensure that I never see you again.
Or your boyfriend here is going to be just another dead nigger!
You getting the shakedown from Mr. Federal Agent?
Welcome to the fucking party.
- You in?
- Yeah, I'll take it.
Now where you supposed to get that kind of money by tomorrow?
We got guns.
Tomorrow, 3:00 at the grow house.
Just you and me and your friend, right?
- Why?
- It just wouldn't be any fun without him.
It's Shane's graduation.
I can't do this.
You gonna reschedule with U-Turn?
- What do you want?
- Something you want.
Pussy?

Greetings, Agrestic Elementary School, class of 2006.
Did you know about all this stuff?
Of course not.
You never clean anymore.
- I think he do this for you.
- Please.
Look, he decide to steal cameras, not the car stereos and doorknobs.
Why would anyone steal a doorknob?
There are some nice doorknobs.
- Lupita, listen.
- Yes?
- If something were to happen to me...
- What's going to happen to you?
- Nothing, nothing, but if something did...
- Yes?
The kids go to my sister Jill.
Not to Andy, okay?
Jill.
Her number's in my book.
Jill Price-Gray with a fucking hyphen.
- Fucking hyphen.
- Under "J" for Jill.
You know what?
Don't worry about it.
Nothing is gonna happen.
Yeah.
I'm gonna be fine.
- Okay.
- Okay.
I'm not going to Chile with you.
Okay.
To Bolivia, then, or one of the guays.
Para?
Ura?
You decide.
Why?
Why do we have to leave?
Because I stole $1.3 million worth of poker chips from a casino in Canada.
And Abumchuck is not just a bounty hunter, but he's also an ultimate fighter.
But don't worry.
I have a plan.
We'll go down to South America.
We find this guy, Helmut, serious gambler.
He'll buy the chips for 34 cents on the dollar, and we'll get a little casita and have babies.
I always know exactly when I'm ovulating.
Oh, my God.
We'll leave today after graduation.
I'll make a Waldorf salad for the road or a corn salad.
I make a great corn salad.
Do we have a cooler?
You know, I haven't forgotten how you stabbed me, screaming, "Die, shitheel, die."
You stepped on my spirit turtle.
You are bat-shit nuts, Kat, and I love that about you.
But I never meant for you to find me again, and I cannot go away with you.
You know how I hate to travel alone.
I want to lick the space where your toes used to be.
I know you do.
I know.
Oh, God, that's it, right there, right there, right there.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a fucking cold bitch.
Silas, it's me again.
I'm offering you amnesty if you come home in the next hour.
Probation, if you show up for graduation.
At the very least, please let me know you're okay.
Wow.
You look very handsome.
Are we moving?
Why don't you let me get through today, and then ask me about that again tomorrow, okay?
Is Silas coming to my graduation?
I'm not sure about that.
- Mom?
- Yeah?
What do I tell people when they ask what you do?
You tell them I'm your mom.
I've been doing some research on the Internet, and I really think Pittsburgh is the place for us.
I'll keep that in mind.
Pittsburgh.
Okay.
Pittsburgh.
- Good morning.
- "Good morning," what?
Oh, no.
I spilled.
I'll go get the paper towels.
Honey, relax.
It's just a little milk.
- But Mom will totally...
- Mom will what?
- Mom's not here.
- But she'll be back.
No, honey.
Not this time.
Really.
Come on.
Dad, you know the Harry Potter books that we've read?
Love them all.
Love the Harry Potter.
Mom is Voldemort.
Don't you know that?
You may have reduced her to vapor now, but she is out there, gathering her strength, and she will be back.
Don't you know that?
You better get ready for graduation.
Big day today.
Big day.
Silas, we're leaving for graduation now.
I hope you'll meet us there.
This is really important to Shane.
Really.
Don't do this to him.
Oh...
Jesus, you scared me.
Good.
I hope you peed your panties.
- Where is he?
- Who?
Oh, right.
I guess you had to ask that.
"Who, Celia,
"the one who called you a drunk at a public assembly
"or the one who stole civic property?"
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I have Silas on video stealing.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, not today.
Mom, we're gonna be late.
Where the hell did you get a gun?
I borrowed it from Pam.
Oh, my God!
I only had the one bullet.
I was gonna shoot Doug.
I'll see you at graduation.
Are you okay?
This would have never happened in Pittsburgh.
Why am I even here?
I heard you might be meeting your maker today, so we figured,
"Let's send that boy off to die with a nice hot breakfast in his belly."
- What do you know?
- What do we know?
Vaneeta, what do we know?
Is the baby too little for a blueberry?
No, but if you give it to him, cut it up real small.
And put a bib on, 'cause that shit gonna stain.
Heylia got a little visit from your girlfriend.
I told her not to come to you all.
Don't nobody listen to you, Conrad.
He come after you?
- Yeah.
- He gonna want to finish it.
Probably.
Let me ask you this.
You want to die today?
No.
Eat your fucking waffle.
Greetings, Agrestic Elementary School, class of 2006.
Hello, teachers, parents, stepparents, siblings, boyfriends and girlfriends of parents, assorted relatives, friends of your mom and dad who you call aunt and uncle who really aren't, and Principal Dodge.
As I stand before you today on the brink of junior high, here is what I have to say.
You have failed us all!
Everything is not okay!
We have become alienated, desensitized,
angry and frightened.
If we picture Agrestic as an airplane, a grand soaring jet carrying us through the sky,
I think you all need to understand, there are motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane.
Okay.
Okay, that's it, Botwin.
That is quite enough.
You said no profanity.
You are done.
Now, here's your diploma.
And you are Agrestic Junior High's problem now.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to give out the diplomas.
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
Motherfucking let him motherfucking speak!
I will call off this graduation if we don't have order right now!
- I mean it!
- God.
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
- Silence!
I'm not...
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
- Everybody, be quiet.
- Let him speak!
Let him speak!
- We are not safe!
You moved here so that you could feel safe, but your children are not safe!
So help me, I will boot you off the stage like a NERF ball.
- I'm not done.
- I have to go.
You can take Shane to the party, and I'll see you guys later.
Tell Shane I'm sorry I had to go.
- Where are you going?
- It's business.
- No.
No, but you...
- Will you turn off this fucking mike?
Where are you going?
Congratulations, you've all graduated.
Goodbye.
Either you control your woman, or I will.
I hear you.
I'm cutting in.
Are you my boyfriend or not?
I liberated a case of Cactus Cooler for the ride.
- I'm not coming with you.
- It tastes like baby aspirin.
Oh, well, in that case, I'm still not going with you.
Jesus, you scared me.
You ought to let a person know you're coming.
I could have cut you up into seven little men holding hands.
You hear from our friend?
Yeah, he left a note on my car.
He's trying to scare me.
- Is it working?
- Fuck, yes.
You're a good kisser.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
What's "Oh, shit"?
Abumchuck.
It's now or never.
Come with me.
I can't be alone, and you're my favorite person on Earth.
I can't do it, Kat.
Fine.
Fuck you.
Give me your van keys.
You can't have my van.
I'm just gonna steal it anyway.
Fine.
- Wife-fucker.
- Career-wrecker.
- You punched my neck.
- You're freakishly tall.
I'm also freakishly long, so imagine how much of me was inside your wife.
- Hey, come here.
- Did you hear my speech?
- No, I missed it.
- You're an asshole.
Look, I'm sorry.
Okay?
I had stuff to do.
Where's Mom?
I don't know.
She took off during my speech.
- Did she say where she was going?
- No, she just left.
Some fucking family you got stuck with, huh?
Hey, what's up?
Man, you coming in real time, or you coming in black-people time?
All right, we'll be here.
Black-people time?
Some of us like watermelon.
Some of us got big dicks.
Most of us have trouble getting places on time.
I get it.
I like gin, and I'm not much for hugging.
Did you bring a gun?
Actually, that's one cultural stereotype that I am not fulfilling today.
I brought a gun.
Celia left one at my house this morning after she shot out my kitchen cabinet.
Jesus.
Give me that fucking thing.
There aren't any bullets in it.
Another great plan from you.
You shouldn't put metal in a microwave.
Hi, honey, I got your note.
You sure know how to charm a girl.
Have you been fucking him the whole time you were married to me?

- But you're a liar.
It's just business between us.

She fucks like a wild animal.
Hey, guys.
Oh, isn't it my shift?
You're the little shit who smashed my muffin.
Forgive me?
If you let go, I will kill you.
I will kill you.
I will kill you, you son of a bitch.
I will...
Oh!
All right, now you're dead.
Now you are fucking dead, Doug Wilson!
I have no respect for you personally, but I always thought you were cute.
And I'm single now.
I worked you like a puppet!
I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Listen to me!
You listen to me!
Get off me right now, and I might spare your fucking life!
By the way, have you seen your nephew?
Oh, never mind.
Suit looks good.
I'll be in touch.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Jesus, people are so rude in the South.
Well, that's it.
- Yeah?
- Yep, we're broken up.
Sorry, kid.
He's a heartbreaker, that one.
- Yeah, well, maybe they deserve each other.
- Who?
Shane and Kat.
Yeah, well, she's gone.
I know.
They left together.
They left...
Shit.
When?
A few minutes ago.

Yo, motherfuckers, anybody home?

Now, are you gonna do the diligent, or am I?
It's diligence.
It's nice titties.
Okay, I've shown you mine.
You show me yours.
In a minute.
I got to pee.
Where's your fucking toilet?
Doing that maple lemonade fast flushes you out.
Pees more than my cousin Jerome who only got one kidney.
Poor Jerome.
We are gonna have the best adventure.
Thanks for keeping me company, Shane.
Cactus Cooler?
- Where are we going?
- Where do you want to go?
- Pittsburgh.
- Okay.
But we have to make a quick stop in Paraguay first.
Cool.
Tastes like baby aspirin.
Step on it, Geronimo.
You watch that shit, man.
Yes?
No, no, no, no.
Go, go, go.
Go.
Kesheshian says "Goodbye."
Yeah, I been on this flush.
Yeah, maple lemonade.
My kid's graduating, so could we just get through this?
You give us the money.
We give you the drugs.
Everybody goes away.
You don't see the cash until I see the weed.
- Marvin, help me with this.
- No, hey.
Open it.
No.
You don't see the weed till I see the cash.
You know what?
You're almost right about that.
What the fuck?
Yeah, now give us the drugs, and we'll let you live.
Open her up.
But where's...
Where's the money?
Ain't no money, fool!
I'm a fucking criminal!
Now, open up the safe before I shoot both you all.
I hear you.
You're a wonderful criminal.
Bitch.

I'm thinking you ain't got no army.
Oh, shit.

We've ran into, like, a little problem.
There ain't no money, 'cause they decided to jack us.
Son of a bitch, motherfucker.
Fine, fine.
We take the pot, then.
No way.
That's my shit.
Why?

- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We all got guns.
- Excuse me.
We kill each other, then nobody gets nothing!
He's dead?
- Peter?
- Yes!
Okay, okay, sorry.
There's a lot of data flying around.
Will somebody open the fucking safe?
- You got to pee again?
- Shut the fuck up!
Open the fucking safe!
- Nancy, open the fucking safe!
- Okay.
Oh, not today.
- Ain't no motherfucking weed in here.

Bitch, you about to die.
Relax, everybody.

Now, here's your diploma.
And you are Agrestic Junior High's problem now.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to give out the diplomas.
-Let him speak!
Let him speak!
-Let him speak!
Let him speak!
Motherfucking let him motherfucking speak!
I will call off this graduation if we don't have order right now!
-I mean it!
-God.
-Let him speak!
Let him speak!
-Silence!
I'm not...
-Let him speak!
Let him speak!
-Everybody, be quiet.
-Let him speak!
Let him speak!
-We are not safe!
You moved here so that you could feel safe, but your children are not safe!
So help me, I will boot you off the stage like a NERF ball.
-I'm not done.
-I have to go.
You can take Shane to the party, and I'll see you guys later.
Tell Shane I'm sorry I had to go.
-Where are you going?
-It's business.
-No.
No, but you...
-Will you turn off this fucking mike?
Where are you going?
Congratulations, you've all graduated.
Goodbye.
Either you control your woman, or I will.
I hear you.
I'm cutting in.
Are you my boyfriend or not?
I liberated a case of Cactus Cooler for the ride.
-I'm not coming with you.
-It tastes like baby aspirin.
Oh, well, in that case, I'm still not going with you.
Jesus, you scared me.
You ought to let a person know you're coming.
I could have cut you up into seven little men holding hands.
You hear from our friend?
Yeah, he left a note on my car.
He's trying to scare me.
-Is it working?
-Fuck, yes.
You're a good kisser.
-Oh, shit.
-What?
What's "Oh, shit"?
Abumchuck.
It's now or never.
Come with me.
I can't be alone, and you're my favorite person on Earth.
I can't do it, Kat.
Fine.
Fuck you.
Give me your van keys.
You can't have my van.
I'm just gonna steal it anyway.
Fine.
-Wife-fucker.
-Career-wrecker.
-You punched my neck.
-You're freakishly tall.
I'm also freakishly long, so imagine how much of me was inside your wife.
-Hey, come here.
-Did you hear my speech?
-No, I missed it.
-You're an asshole.
Look, I'm sorry.
Okay?
I had stuff to do.
Where's Mom?
I don't know.
She took off during my speech.
-Did she say where she was going?
-No, she just left.
Some fucking family you got stuck with, huh?
Hey, what's up?
Man, you coming in real time, or you coming in black-people time?
AII right, we'll be here.
Black-people time?
Some of us like watermelon.
Some of us got big dicks.
Most of us have trouble getting places on time.
I get it.
I like gin, and I'm not much for hugging.
Did you bring a gun?
Actually, that's one cultural stereotype that I am not fulfilling today.
I brought a gun.
Celia left one at my house this morning after she shot out my kitchen cabinet.
Jesus.
Give me that fucking thing.
There aren't any bullets in it.
Another great plan from you.
You shouldn't put metal in a microwave.
Hi, honey, I got your note.
You sure know how to charm a girl.
Have you been fucking him the whole time you were married to me?
-No, I told you that.
-But you're a liar.
It's just business between us.
always has been.
Your loss.
She fucks like a wild animal.
Hey, guys.
Oh, isn't it my shift?
You're the little shit who smashed my muffin.
Forgive me?
If you let go, I will kill you.
I will kill you.
I will kill you, you son of a bitch.
I will...
Oh!
AII right, now you're dead.
Now you are fucking dead, Doug Wilson!
I have no respect for you personally, but I always thought you were cute.
And I'm single now.
I worked you like a puppet!
I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Listen to me!
You listen to me!
Get off me right now, and I might spare your fucking life!
By the way, have you seen your nephew?
Oh, never mind.
Suit looks good.
I'll be in touch.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Jesus, people are so rude in the South.
Well, that's it.
-Yeah?
-Yep, we're broken up.
Sorry, kid.
He's a heartbreaker, that one.
-Yeah, well, maybe they deserve each other.
-Who?
Shane and Kat.
Yeah, well, she's gone.
I know.
They left together.
They left...
Shit.
When?
A few minutes ago.
The two of them took off.
Yo, motherfuckers, anybody home?
Big bad wolf coming in.
-I'll be waiting in my truck.
-What the fuck, little piggies?
You out, too.
-Not with him.
-Somebody got to answer the door.
Hold up!
Okay.
Just be very quiet.
You hear me?
Okay.
No noise.
Don't come out of here, no matter what.
Don't you come out, okay?
Okay.
-Oh, hey.
-It's about time.
I was just about to huff and puff.
Some nice setup you got here.
Now take off your shirt.
-What?
-Take off your fucking shirt.
Marvin, check Conrad for a wire.
She's mine.
-Now, hold up, dog.
That's bullshit.
-It's called due diligent.
Now, are you gonna do the diligent, or am I?
It's diligence.
It's nice titties.
Okay, I've shown you mine.
You show me yours.
In a minute.
I got to pee.
Where's your fucking toilet?
Doing that maple lemonade fast flushes you out.
Pees more than my cousin Jerome who only got one kidney.
Poor Jerome.
We are gonna have the best adventure.
Thanks for keeping me company, Shane.
Cactus Cooler?
-Where are we going?
-Where do you want to go?
-Pittsburgh.
-Okay.
But we have to make a quick stop in Paraguay first.
Cool.
Tastes like baby aspirin.
Step on it, Geronimo.
You watch that shit, man.
Yes?
No, no, no, no.
Go, go, go.
Go.
Kesheshian says "Goodbye."
Yeah, I been on this flush.
Yeah, maple lemonade.
My kid's graduating, so could we just get through this?
You give us the money.
We give you the drugs.
Everybody goes away.
You don't see the cash until I see the weed.
-Marvin, help me with this.
-No, hey.
Open it.
No.
You don't see the weed till I see the cash.
You know what?
You're almost right about that.
What the fuck?
Yeah, now give us the drugs, and we'll let you live.
Open her up.
But where's...
Where's the money?
Ain't no money, fool!
I'm a fucking criminal!
Now, open up the safe before I shoot both you all.
I hear you.
You're a wonderful criminal.
Bitch.
What the hell are you thinking, dog?
I'm thinking you ain't got no army.
Oh, shit.
Right now, business is business, homeboy.
-Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck?
-Son of a bitch.
Where's the money?
The negro lady says I kill agent asshole, you pay us.
He's dead?
Where is my money, Conrad?
We've ran into, like, a little problem.
There ain't no money, 'cause they decided to jack us.
Son of a bitch, motherfucker.
Fine, fine.
We take the pot, then.
No way.
That's my shit.
Why?
You killing federal agent?
Me killing all y'all!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We all got guns.
-Excuse me.
We kill each other, then nobody gets nothing!
He's dead?
-Peter?
-Yes!
Okay, okay, sorry.
There's a lot of data flying around.
Will somebody open the fucking safe?
-You got to pee again?
-Shut the fuck up!
Open the fucking safe!
-Nancy, open the fucking safe!
-Okay.
Oh, not today.
-Ain't no motherfucking weed in here.
-Where the fuck is the shit?
Bitch, you about to die.
Relax, everybody.
I'm...
I'm reaching for my cell phone.
Hold on.
It's ringing.
Hi, Nancy.
Honey, did you take something that doesn't belong to you?
I want in.
That's him.
That's the little fucker who stole my cameras.
Arrest him.
Shit.
Previously on The West Wing:
I'm gonna need another cop when Bartlet leaves office.
Secretary of State?
I'm not asking you if you'd consider it, Arnie, I'm asking you to do it.
So presidential pardons.
'Tis the season, right?
The DOJ and the Pardon Attorney are reviewing applications but I don't think anybody's had an opportunity...
Is Toby on a list somewhere?
For a moment, I thought you came because you gave a crap and wanted to see how I was doing.
You don't need a pardon, just a frying pan to the side of your head.
- I don't want a pardon.
- Well, that simplifies matters, thanks.
It promises to be a cold and windy day here at the Capitol.
As predicted, 140,000 spectators crowd the Capitol mall to watch Matthew Santos take the oath of office as the next president of the United States.
It's the end of an era, as President Bartlet steps down after eight tumultuous years in the Oval Office.
President Bartlet's popularity can certainly help Matthew Santos in this tight electoral race...
It's gonna be cold on that dais today.
Who in his right mind decided that January would be the best time of year to hold an outdoor ceremony north of the equator?
Jefferson.
Adams.
Franklin.
They should've lined them up and shot them.
- That's what King George had in mind.
- January 20th?
- They got a few things right.
- Habeas corpus, sure.
Freedom of speech but separation of powers, what a crock.
You did a lot of good, Jed.
A lot of good.
- Pearls or the gold cross?
- Gold cross.
You don't think it makes me look like Mary Magdalene...?
Gold cross.
- What are you wearing?
- Long underwear.
- You look bulky.
- Lou doesn't want me to wear an overcoat when I take the oath.
- It's gonna be 10 below out there.
- Youth.
Vitality...
- Frostbite?
- Never too early to think re-elect.
That was a short honeymoon.
The National Security Advisor and McLean are here.
- Then we run through today's schedule.
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
Thanks.
Do you notice how he just knocks and walks right in?
I know, honey.
I'll talk to him about it.
We're gonna have to figure out some kind of signal when we want privacy.
Like a necktie on the doorknob.
Thanks.
- General McLean, huh?
- Yeah.
He's gonna give me the card with the nuclear codes.
- It's a card?
Really?
- So I've been told.
- Better not leave that laying around.
- Oh, God.
Come on, it will be an adventure.
It's what you told me when you wanted to run for city council and I didn't want you to:
"Come on it'll be an adventure."
Perfect.
The Weather Service issued an ice-storm warning for Southern New England.
- Anything we can do?
- Send them some salt?
Pardon Attorney needs the signature on the clemency warrants.
- The president decided on the final list?
- Last night.
Thirty-six pardons, 17 commutations.
Anybody gonna set the press's hair on fire?
- Peggy Ann Green.
- Pot-Pushing Peggy.
- It's medicinal.
- I bet the first joint's free.
- Well, DEA isn't gonna be happy.
- Morning, sunshine.
Chief Usher's waiting for you and Will's already in there.
Big ice storm in New England, up to a quarter inch accumulation on the ground.
- Send them salt.
- Mallory called.
- Wants to drop by in about an hour.
- Leo's Mallory?
Said she has something she wants you to pass on to the president.
- You ready for Curtis?
- Sure.
Write your note for the flak jacket?
Don't know any useful advice to pass on.
It's tradition.
You can't break the chain.
Just make it funny.
Got a pardon list?
Fourth estate's chomping at the bit.
- Last night.
- Anybody gonna add a little spice to my final briefing?
- Peggy Ann Green.
Granny Pot.
Hot diggity dog.
A final act of self-immolation before the hungry hordes.
- You sound positively giddy.
- I was reaching for more like delight.
You enjoy being a human piniata on C-SPAN?
Never know what you've got till it's gone.
Mr. Chief Usher, what can we do for you?
I thought I should take a moment to remind you of today's schedule for the removal of the Bartlets' things from the building.
As soon as the president and first lady leave for the Capitol 90 of my staff will begin packing the Bartlets' possessions.
Precisely at noon, 16 moving vans will line up at the South Portico.
And an additional 30 staff members will arrive at the West Wing to pack the Oval Office.
After Mass at Holy Trinity, come back here before heading to the White House for a reception with the president, first lady and the JCCIC.
- JCCIC?
- Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.
- Hence the acronym.
Following the reception the president-elect and the president will travel to the Capitol for the swearing-in in a single limousine.
- Mrs. Bartlet and I gonna hitch?
- Hike up that skirt.
You'll do fine.
The president and the first lady will then be escorted to the podium.
You and Mrs. Santos are taken through the Capitol to be introduced.
Ronna?
Sellner will deliver the remarks, followed by the invocation followed by Keb' Mo' and Gloria Estefan.
- I'm looking forward to that.
- You're not gonna be wearing pantyhose.
Followed by a poetry reading by Jimmy Santiago Baca.
Then at noon exactly, you take the oath of office.
Followed by a 21 -gun salute and the playing of "Hail to the Chief."
In case you weren't feeling important after they gave you the launch codes.
- You then give your inaugural address.
After, you will escort the Bartlets to the limo that will take them to Andrews for their trip.
Do I get to start governing anytime in here?
Soon as you take the oath of office, we start moving staff into the West Wing.
Do we really have to go to nine parties?
You only have to stay for 20 minutes.
One dance, shake hands, on to the next.
- What kind of dance?
- What's your favorite song?
I'll sneak it.
I'm not dancing to "You Can Leave Your Hat On."
- Sir, we should really head to the church.
- Let's get it on.
We're to leave our credentials at the front desk when we exit the building.
They've asked that we vacate our parking spaces by 2 p.m.
- Not a problem.
I walked today.
- Really?
- Yes, I often walk.
- You do?
Sometimes I walk.
I'll walk a lot more when I get back to California.
- Los Angeles being a pedestrian nirvana.
- That was disappointing.
- What was?
- See my final briefing?
- No.
- Didn't push back on Pot-Pushing Peggy.
- Must be heartbroken.
Inconsolable.
There's a train derailment in New England.
- The ice storm?
- Just came over on CNN.
- Got a minute?
- Apparently, I'm good until 2.
Then I gotta move my car.
Pardon Attorney brought the warrants for the president to sign.
He called her early this morning.
Asked her to add a name.
It's the last one.
You may get your wish for a final pasting on national television.
Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Morning.
- How are you feeling?
- Unemployed.
Lot of that going around the building.
Dr. McNally is waiting to give you your security briefing.
You asked me to remind you to write a note to the president-elect.
And Ms. Cregg is anxious to speak with you.
- Mr. President?
- Hey, all.
- You heard about this ice storm in...?
- New England.
The storm caused a train derailment.
On Amtrak's regional route between Portland, Maine and Boston.
- Any fatalities?
- Thirteen injuries so far.
The worst is a badly broken leg.
With the weather, we'll need emergency rescue before everybody freezes.
- Sounds like a state matter.
- Normally, yes.
It's between the Exeter and Haverhill stops.
Known as the New Hampshire- Massachusetts border.
The governors are fighting.
Sidley says it's New Hampshire's.
Wilkins says it's a Massachusetts issue.
- Get the governor on the phone.
- Which governor, sir?
Whichever you can get on the line first.
Should we nationalize the Guard, sir?
Send in units?
Don't you think that's something the president might want to avoid?
We should survey the accident site to resolve the dispute?
What are we supposed to do?
Send in cartographers?
- Both governors are on the line, sir.
- Thank you.
Pick a number.
Two or four.
- Two.
- Four.
Governor, call up the Guard unit and get them to this crash site.
No one gives a damn where the accident is.
Be that as it may, sir, you are about to become a star player in my soon-to-be-written autobiography.
It's the right decision.
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- You're hovering, Claudia Jean?
- Yes, sir.
What you got there?
The pardons and clemency warrants for your signature.
- I haven't decided to do it.
- No?
Do you have an opinion?
I'm sure you'll do whatever you think is best.
Toby's is the last one in the folder.
- Anything else?
- No, sir.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Governor Wilkins is still holding on two.
Tell him I'll be right there.
- How's the baby?
- Wonderful.
Noisy.
All boy.
Sam's coming back to work for Josh.
That's great.
- How is he?
- Engaged.
Good for him.
Say hello for me, would you?
He's in town.
You can tell him yourself.
I've been going through Dad's stuff and I found something the president might want to have back.
You don't want to give it to him?
- It's a little sentimental.
- I'll make sure he gets it.
Thanks.
Dad loved every moment he spent here.
Mrs. Bartlet called, asked me to remind you that the Santoses are expected in the residence in less than 55 minutes.
She asked me to mention that you need to leave time enough to change before they arrive.
Mrs. Bartlet doesn't want me wearing penny loafers and a cardigan to the inaugural?
That's about the gist of it, yes, sir.
Did you write that note to President-Elect Santos yet?
Saving that for last.
- All done.
- What about that one?
I'm still on the fence.
You do realize that you turn into a pumpkin at noon?
I'm gonna take one final stroll around the joint.
Make sure nobody's making off with the cutlery.
Fifty-three minutes.
- Did he sign it?
- Not yet.
- Is he going to sign it?
- I have no idea.
You think he should sign it?
The Founding Fathers left it to the president to decide who should get clemency.
National Guard on the way to the train accident?
We probably witnessed the final act of governance of the administration:
The president serving as national school marm on a snow day.
Nice job on Granny Ganja.
I thought you'd have gotten more of a rise.
- Yeah, me too.
- You do the flak-jacket note yet?
- Little writer's block.
- Just make it funny.
Right.
Let me know if he signs it.
- Signs what?
- You're a little early.
The Santoses went to church, so I got an hour before heading over to the Capitol.
Thought I'd drop by and make one last stab at getting you to stay on.
Nine-thirty tomorrow morning, Dulles to LAX, non-stop.
Glass of bad merlot.
Three bags of peanuts and an Ambien.
- But thanks for asking.
- Danny?
Waiting at LAX with a tub of sunscreen.
So, Baker for V.P. You're gonna have quite a battle up on the Hill.
Yeah, we're hoping Vinick at State helps grease the skids a little.
You ever stop thinking of this as Leo's office?
No.
Oh, hey, I've got something for you.
- "WWLD"?
- "What Would Leo Do?"
You're gonna do great, Josh.
You don't need me.
- Morning, Carol.
- Mr. President.
Thanks for your work.
Couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Morning, Ray.
Thank you.
- Morning, sir.
- Hey, Carla.
- Mr. President.
Larry.
Gonna finally get some time with the kids now, I hope.
- Absolutely, Mr. President.
- Ed, thanks.
No, sir.
Thank you.
- Nancy, how's your mother doing?
- She's fine now.
Tell her I'm looking forward to seeing her soon.
- Absolutely, sir.
- Thank you.
- Gotta go.
Do you need something, sir?
- Heard a rumor about you and the Oregon Fourth.
Any truth to it?
D-Triple-C thinks it'll be a tough race.
Give me a call.
I'll help you pound in some lawn signs.
I'll have a mallet ready, sir.
Excuse me, will you?
- Morning, Charlie.
- Mr. President.
You made a decision about your future?
- Georgetown Law.
- You got the early acceptance?
I think the letter from you may have helped a little, sir.
I don't need this anymore.
I thought maybe you could get some use out of it.
Was trying to remember if my father had given it to me when I was in the 10th grade or the 11th.
I considered getting you a tie with the scales of justice on it.
Figured you'd use this more.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Charlie.
Homily seemed a little pointed.
The cardinal.
Think he was pushing the "swords into plowshares" stuff hard?
Well, he's right.
This Kazakhstan thing is a mess.
We got thousands of our soldiers in the middle of Central Asia.
They haven't a clue as to what's next.
Nine inaugural balls.
You think I'm supposed to wear nine gowns?
- Do you have nine gowns?
- No.
Well then, probably not.
- Nineteen minutes and counting, sir.
- Almost done.
Well, that's it.
What about that final pardon warrant?
- There's still time.
- Not much.
- Two hours and 19 minutes.
- Two hours and 18.
Mr. President?
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for the Santoses?
- Yes.
- Just leaving.
- So he keeps saying.
Mallory came by this morning and asked me to give you this.
I was gonna ask Debbie to send it with you on the plane, but...
- Why didn't she stop in and say hello?
- I don't think she wanted to bother you.
- Sixteen minutes, sir.
- I'm a fast dresser.
Not that fast.
Why don't I put this in your briefcase for the plane.
Your letter to President-Elect Santos?
It's been a pleasure, Claudia Jean.
The pleasure's been all mine, sir.
- Thank you.
Thanks so much.
- I really appreciate it.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. President-Elect.
- Thank you so much for your help.
- Goodbye.
Thank you.
Good luck, sir.
- You okay?
- Sure.
We could make a run for it, you know.
Catch the first plane out of Dulles, head to Panama.
- I hear Uruguay's nice.
- Southern Hemisphere.
- It's summer there.
- Cheaper housing.
- You speak the language.
- What about the kids?
- We'll send them a postcard.
- They'll be pissed.
- I left enough time.
- No, you didn't.
- I was ready before they got here.
- Because they're running late.
When was the last time someone actually was late to meet us?
Eight years ago to the day.
Get used to it.
It's gonna happen a lot more.
The girls are gonna be waiting for us when we get to the farm this evening.
It's supposed to be a surprise.
Act like it.
Tonight?
I was looking forward to some peace and quiet.
I know.
That's why I'm warning you.
I don't want you to look stricken when you see them.
Does it have to be tonight?
They just wanted to show you their love and support in your hour of need.
Afraid you might have re-entry issues, returning to live amongst us mortals.
Have I been so out of touch?
When was the last time you used a phone?
Or went to a bank?
Or drove a car?
It's just like riding a bike, only more horsepower, right?
Excuse me, Mr. President?
The Santoses have arrived.
- They're in the Blue Room.
- Thank you.
Abbey?
Nine inaugural balls.
How's that supposed to work?
You want to skip the champagne when they do the toast.
I'm afraid I made a bit of a mess this morning and it may eat into your news cycle.
- The pardons.
- Granny Pot.
I heard.
And a few others.
- How's the speech?
- It's okay.
Couple of good lines.
There's no "Ask not what your country can do for you," but...
J.F.K. Really screwed us with that one, didn't he?
Have you chosen a biblical quotation for the oath?
Kings Three.
Nine to 11.
Grant thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people?
- That's the one.
- Good choice.
You know what I'm gonna miss the most?
The Marine Corps Band.
Those guys can really play.
Ask them to do "Semper Fidelis." They'll knock your socks off.
Mr. President, Senator Wirth will escort you to the podium.
This way, Mr. President-Elect.
I guess this is where our paths diverge.
- Sure you're ready to retire?
- See you on the podium.
Mr. President-Elect.
Capitol Police estimate today's crowd at over 140,000 with an additional 800,000 expected to line the parade route later.
Incoming Secretary of State, Arnold Vinick, is here.
Senator Vinick surprised many Republicans surprised everyone across the board by accepting a position in Matt Santos ' cabinet perhaps eschewing his own chances to run again in four years.
- It's gonna be cold out there.
- Yeah.
I hope brevity is in order.
I cut the speech down to about 80 pages in the car.
Gettysburg Address was what, four minutes long?
Lot of run-on sentences, though.
Didn't a two-hour inaugural address kill a president once?
William Henry Harrison.
But, yeah, he was 68 and he refused to wear a coat.
You refuse to wear a coat.
But I'm wearing long underwear.
The dignitaries on the platform have taken their positions.
And now, here are President Bartlet and the first lady making their way to their seats on the podium.
After eight years in the White House, they're handing over the reins to the Santoses in a few short minutes.
C.J.?
The president's office just sent this over, says it needs to go to the Pardon Attorney.
- The president surprised both supporters and critics with his willingness to use force abroad and his aggressive pursuit of peace on the world stage.
Man, I hope Janet Spragens has her TV on.
- Who?
- Senior year.
She beat me for the last varsity spot on the swim team.
- Guess what.
- What?
You win.
Well, she did get Don Vogel to take her to the prom instead of me.
We'll call it even then.
No.
I'm pretty sure Janet had to put out so Don would take her.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Helen Santos.
No turning back now.
Ladies and gentlemen, President-Elect of the United States Matthew Vincente Santos.
O Lord, we come together on this historic and solemn occasion to inaugurate a president.
We pray, O Lord, for President-Elect Santos to whom you have entrusted leadership of this great nation.
Give our new president and all who advise him calmness in the face of storms encouragement in the face of frustrations and humility in the face of triumph.
We pray that this good and generous country may be a blessing to the nations of the world and fulfill the hopes of our Founding Fathers.
This we ask in your most holy name.
Amen.
Speaker of the House, Mark B. Sellner.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court to administer the presidential oath of office.
Please raise your hand and repeat after me.
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States.
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States.
And will, to the best of my ability...
And will, to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
...preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
So help me, God.
So help me, God.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon, sir.
- Hey, Gerald.
- Good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
Home sweet home.
Most important is keeping track of who 's going in and out of the Oval Office.
First thing you'll need to do is establish who'll have walk-in privileges.
Usually it's just the first lady and the chief of staff.
At some point, the president is gonna ask you to take away his wife's privileges.
Don't do it, no matter how much he begs.
You have the right to attend the staff meeting.
I never went, because the senior staff was already appropriately intimidated by my stern visage and dry wit.
But you're young.
You have a baby face.
They are gonna try to walk all over you.
You should go.
Your desk sits right outside this door.
You prepare his schedule.
You decide who goes in and who doesn't.
Your most frequent response to any question will be "no."
Say it with empathy and you'll be fine.
- Where is Mrs. Bartlet?
- Already inside the car, sir.
- Nice speech.
- No J.F.K.
No.
But you've got time.
I left something for you on the desk.
- Just some random thoughts.
- I'll look forward to them, sir.
Make me proud, Mr. President.
I'll do my best, Mr. President.
What in the world was he trying to prove by not wearing an overcoat?
Youth and vigor.
He looked like a leader.
He looked like a lunatic.
A young and vigorous lunatic.
Jed?
You made it.
You're still here.
Yeah.
I'm still here.
As they headed to the parade here on Pennsylvania Avenue the president and first lady...
- This 137-B?
- Yeah.
- This gonna be you?
- Looks like it.
- Charlie Young.
- Bram Howard.
- Parade almost over?
- Yep.
Watch out for the thermostat.
Hair one way or the other is the difference between convection oven and meat locker.
- Have fun.
- You bet.
You wanna go see a movie?
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
You got anything better to do?
No, I guess we don't.
Is there a movie theater around here?
I have no idea.
You look good up there.
Thanks.
- We missed you.
- Can't say the feeling's mutual.
President Bartlet pardoned Toby Ziegler.
Any comment?
- Nope.
- You have an opinion?
Sure I do.
Unfortunately, the suite that Mrs. Bartlet was using is going to be torn up for most of the next year while we restore the marble and original moldings.
We're hoping that this suite will meet with Mrs. Santos' approval.
Nice.
The office for the first lady's press secretary would be over here.
- Great, thanks.
Ms. Moss, if you'll follow me.
We hope this will meet with your approval.
Oh, it's lovely.
I'm sure the first lady will be very happy here.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
The first lady's office is next door.
As her chief of staff, this would be your office.
Yes.
This will be fine.
Shall we get started with the Joint Chiefs, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Do you work in there?
- I'm sorry.
What?
We saw you come out the gate.
- You work at the White House?
- No.
No.
I'm sorry, I don't.
Must be something, huh?
Yeah.
Something.
General, admirals, we'll talk about this more in detail tomorrow.
I do appreciate your candor.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
They want 10,000 more troops in Kazakhstan on the ground for logistical support.
Public opinion is already divided over our mission in Central Asia.
Do you want more troops on the ground in your first week?
We may not have a choice.
- What?
- You look good back there.
Excuse me, sir.
It's almost 6.
The first lady called to remind you to change for the inaugural balls.
Thanks.
Tell her I'll be up there in 15 minutes.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
What's next?
Sir, the Senate Democrats wish to move fast on the education bill...
Come in.
Colonel says we'll land in New Hampshire in 20 minutes, sir.
Thank you.
What are you thinking about?
Tomorrow.

Previously on The West Wing:
I'm gonna need another cop when Bartlet leaves office.
Secretary of State?
I'm not asking you if you'd consider it, Arnie, I'm asking you to do it.
So presidential pardons.
'Tis the season, right?
The DOJ and the Pardon Attorney are reviewing applications but I don't think anybody's had an opportunity...
Is Toby on a list somewhere?
For a moment, I thought you came because you gave a crap and wanted to see how I was doing.
You don't need a pardon, just a frying pan to the side of your head.
- I don't want a pardon.
- Well, that simplifies matters, thanks.
It promises to be a cold and windy day here at the Capitol.
As predicted, 140,000 spectators crowd the Capitol mall to watch Matthew Santos take the oath of office as the next president of the United States.
It's the end of an era, as President Bartlet steps down after eight tumultuous years in the Oval Office.
President Bartlet's popularity can certainly help Matthew Santos in this tight electoral race...
It's gonna be cold on that dais today.
Who in his right mind decided that January would be the best time of year to hold an outdoor ceremony north of the equator?
Jefferson.
Adams.
Franklin.
They should've lined them up and shot them.
- That's what King George had in mind.
- January 20th?
- They got a few things right.
- Habeas corpus, sure.
Freedom of speech but separation of powers, what a crock.
You did a lot of good, Jed.
A lot of good.
- Pearls or the gold cross?
- Gold cross.
You don't think it makes me look like Mary Magdalene...?
Gold cross.
- What are you wearing?
- Long underwear.
- You look bulky.
- Lou doesn't want me to wear an overcoat when I take the oath.
- It's gonna be 10 below out there.
- Youth.
Vitality...
- Frostbite?
- Never too early to think re-elect.
That was a short honeymoon.
I'm gonna go with the pearls.
- Mr. President-Elect.
Mrs. Santos.
- Good morning, Bram.
The National Security Advisor and McLean are here.
- Then we run through today's schedule.
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
Thanks.
Do you notice how he just knocks and walks right in?
I know, honey.
I'll talk to him about it.
We're gonna have to figure out some kind of signal when we want privacy.
Like a necktie on the doorknob.
Thanks.
- General McLean, huh?
- Yeah.
He's gonna give me the card with the nuclear codes.
- It's a card?
Really?
- So I've been told.
- Better not leave that laying around.
- Oh, God.
Come on, it will be an adventure.
It's what you told me when you wanted to run for city council and I didn't want you to:
"Come on it'll be an adventure."
Perfect.
The Weather Service issued an ice-storm warning for Southern New England.
- Anything we can do?
- Send them some salt?
Pardon Attorney needs the signature on the clemency warrants.
- The president decided on the final list?
- Last night.
Thirty-six pardons, 17 commutations.
Anybody gonna set the press's hair on fire?
- Peggy Ann Green.
- Pot-Pushing Peggy.
- It's medicinal.
- I bet the first joint's free.
- Well, DEA isn't gonna be happy.
- Morning, sunshine.
Chief Usher's waiting for you and Will's already in there.
Big ice storm in New England, up to a quarter inch accumulation on the ground.
- Send them salt.
- Mallory called.
- Wants to drop by in about an hour.
- Leo's Mallory?
Said she has something she wants you to pass on to the president.
- You ready for Curtis?
- Sure.
Write your note for the flak jacket?
Don't know any useful advice to pass on.
It's tradition.
You can't break the chain.
Just make it funny.
Got a pardon list?
Fourth estate's chomping at the bit.
- Last night.
- Anybody gonna add a little spice to my final briefing?
- Peggy Ann Green.
Granny Pot.
Hot diggity dog.
A final act of self-immolation before the hungry hordes.
- You sound positively giddy.
- I was reaching for more like delight.
You enjoy being a human piniata on C-SPAN?
Never know what you've got till it's gone.
Mr. Chief Usher, what can we do for you?
I thought I should take a moment to remind you of today's schedule for the removal of the Bartlets' things from the building.
As soon as the president and first lady leave for the Capitol 90 of my staff will begin packing the Bartlets' possessions.
Precisely at noon, 16 moving vans will line up at the South Portico.
And an additional 30 staff members will arrive at the West Wing to pack the Oval Office.
After Mass at Holy Trinity, come back here before heading to the White House for a reception with the president, first lady and the JCCIC.
- JCCIC?
- Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.
- Hence the acronym.
Following the reception the president-elect and the president will travel to the Capitol for the swearing-in in a single limousine.
- Mrs. Bartlet and I gonna hitch?
- Hike up that skirt.
You'll do fine.
The president and the first lady will then be escorted to the podium.
You and Mrs. Santos are taken through the Capitol to be introduced.
Ronna?
Sellner will deliver the remarks, followed by the invocation followed by Keb' Mo' and Gloria Estefan.
- I'm looking forward to that.
- You're not gonna be wearing pantyhose.
Followed by a poetry reading by Jimmy Santiago Baca.
Then at noon exactly, you take the oath of office.
Followed by a 21 -gun salute and the playing of "Hail to the Chief."
In case you weren't feeling important after they gave you the launch codes.
- You then give your inaugural address.
After, you will escort the Bartlets to the limo that will take them to Andrews for their trip.
Do I get to start governing anytime in here?
Soon as you take the oath of office, we start moving staff into the West Wing.
Do we really have to go to nine parties?
You only have to stay for 20 minutes.
One dance, shake hands, on to the next.
- What kind of dance?
- What's your favorite song?
I'll sneak it.
I'm not dancing to "You Can Leave Your Hat On."
- Sir, we should really head to the church.
- Let's get it on.
We're to leave our credentials at the front desk when we exit the building.
They've asked that we vacate our parking spaces by 2 p.m.
- Not a problem.
I walked today.
- Really?
- Yes, I often walk.
- You do?
Sometimes I walk.
I'll walk a lot more when I get back to California.
- Los Angeles being a pedestrian nirvana.
- That was disappointing.
- What was?
- See my final briefing?
- No.
- Didn't push back on Pot-Pushing Peggy.
- Must be heartbroken.
Inconsolable.
There's a train derailment in New England.
- The ice storm?
- Just came over on CNN.
- Got a minute?
- Apparently, I'm good until 2.
Then I gotta move my car.
Pardon Attorney brought the warrants for the president to sign.
He called her early this morning.
Asked her to add a name.
It's the last one.
You may get your wish for a final pasting on national television.
Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Morning.
- How are you feeling?
- Unemployed.
Lot of that going around the building.
Dr. McNally is waiting to give you your security briefing.
You asked me to remind you to write a note to the president-elect.
And Ms. Cregg is anxious to speak with you.
- Mr. President?
- Hey, all.
- You heard about this ice storm in...?
- New England.
The storm caused a train derailment.
On Amtrak's regional route between Portland, Maine and Boston.
- Any fatalities?
- Thirteen injuries so far.
The worst is a badly broken leg.
With the weather, we'll need emergency rescue before everybody freezes.
- Sounds like a state matter.
- Normally, yes.
It's between the Exeter and Haverhill stops.
Known as the New Hampshire- Massachusetts border.
The governors are fighting.
Sidley says it's New Hampshire's.
Wilkins says it's a Massachusetts issue.
- Get the governor on the phone.
- Which governor, sir?
Whichever you can get on the line first.
Should we nationalize the Guard, sir?
Send in units?
Don't you think that's something the president might want to avoid?
We should survey the accident site to resolve the dispute?
What are we supposed to do?
Send in cartographers?
- Both governors are on the line, sir.
- Thank you.
Pick a number.
Two or four.
- Two.
- Four.
Governor, call up the Guard unit and get them to this crash site.
No one gives a damn where the accident is.
Be that as it may, sir, you are about to become a star player in my soon-to-be-written autobiography.
It's the right decision.
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- You're hovering, Claudia Jean?
- Yes, sir.
What you got there?
The pardons and clemency warrants for your signature.
- I haven't decided to do it.
- No?
Do you have an opinion?
I'm sure you'll do whatever you think is best.
Toby's is the last one in the folder.
- Anything else?
- No, sir.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Governor Wilkins is still holding on two.
Tell him I'll be right there.
- How's the baby?
- Wonderful.
Noisy.
All boy.
Sam's coming back to work for Josh.
That's great.
- How is he?
- Engaged.
Good for him.
Say hello for me, would you?
He's in town.
You can tell him yourself.
I've been going through Dad's stuff and I found something the president might want to have back.
You don't want to give it to him?
- It's a little sentimental.
- I'll make sure he gets it.
Thanks.
Dad loved every moment he spent here.
Mrs. Bartlet called, asked me to remind you that the Santoses are expected in the residence in less than 55 minutes.
She asked me to mention that you need to leave time enough to change before they arrive.
Mrs. Bartlet doesn't want me wearing penny loafers and a cardigan to the inaugural?
That's about the gist of it, yes, sir.
Did you write that note to President-Elect Santos yet?
Saving that for last.
- All done.
- What about that one?
I'm still on the fence.
You do realize that you turn into a pumpkin at noon?
I'm gonna take one final stroll around the joint.
Make sure nobody's making off with the cutlery.
Fifty-three minutes.
- Did he sign it?
- Not yet.
- Is he going to sign it?
- I have no idea.
You think he should sign it?
The Founding Fathers left it to the president to decide who should get clemency.
National Guard on the way to the train accident?
We probably witnessed the final act of governance of the administration:
The president serving as national school marm on a snow day.
Nice job on Granny Ganja.
I thought you'd have gotten more of a rise.
- Yeah, me too.
- You do the flak-jacket note yet?
- Little writer's block.
- Just make it funny.
Right.
Let me know if he signs it.
- Signs what?
- You're a little early.
The Santoses went to church, so I got an hour before heading over to the Capitol.
Thought I'd drop by and make one last stab at getting you to stay on.
Nine-thirty tomorrow morning, Dulles to LAX, non-stop.
Glass of bad merlot.
Three bags of peanuts and an Ambien.
- But thanks for asking.
- Danny?
Waiting at LAX with a tub of sunscreen.
So, Baker for V.P. You're gonna have quite a battle up on the Hill.
Yeah, we're hoping Vinick at State helps grease the skids a little.
You ever stop thinking of this as Leo's office?
No.
Oh, hey, I've got something for you.
- "WWLD"?
- "What Would Leo Do?"
You're gonna do great, Josh.
You don't need me.
- Morning, Carol.
- Mr. President.
Thanks for your work.
Couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
- Morning, Ray.
Thank you.
- Morning, sir.
- Hey, Carla.
- Mr. President.
Larry.
Gonna finally get some time with the kids now, I hope.
- Absolutely, Mr. President.
- Ed, thanks.
No, sir.
Thank you.
- Nancy, how's your mother doing?
- She's fine now.
Tell her I'm looking forward to seeing her soon.
- Absolutely, sir.
- Thank you.
- Gotta go.
Do you need something, sir?
- Heard a rumor about you and the Oregon Fourth.
Any truth to it?
D-Triple-C thinks it'll be a tough race.
Give me a call.
I'll help you pound in some lawn signs.
I'll have a mallet ready, sir.
Excuse me, will you?
- Morning, Charlie.
- Mr. President.
You made a decision about your future?
- Georgetown Law.
- You got the early acceptance?
I think the letter from you may have helped a little, sir.
I don't need this anymore.
I thought maybe you could get some use out of it.
Was trying to remember if my father had given it to me when I was in the 10th grade or the 11th.
I considered getting you a tie with the scales of justice on it.
Figured you'd use this more.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Charlie.
Homily seemed a little pointed.
The cardinal.
Think he was pushing the "swords into plowshares" stuff hard?
Well, he's right.
This Kazakhstan thing is a mess.
We got thousands of our soldiers in the middle of Central Asia.
They haven't a clue as to what's next.
Nine inaugural balls.
You think I'm supposed to wear nine gowns?
- Do you have nine gowns?
- No.
Well then, probably not.
- Nineteen minutes and counting, sir.
- Almost done.
Well, that's it.
What about that final pardon warrant?
- There's still time.
- Not much.
- Two hours and 19 minutes.
- Two hours and 18.
Mr. President?
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for the Santoses?
- Yes.
- Just leaving.
- So he keeps saying.
Mallory came by this morning and asked me to give you this.
I was gonna ask Debbie to send it with you on the plane, but...
- Why didn't she stop in and say hello?
- I don't think she wanted to bother you.
- Sixteen minutes, sir.
- I'm a fast dresser.
Not that fast.
Why don't I put this in your briefcase for the plane.
Your letter to President-Elect Santos?
It's been a pleasure, Claudia Jean.
The pleasure's been all mine, sir.
- Thank you.
Thanks so much.
- I really appreciate it.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. President-Elect.
- Thank you so much for your help.
- Goodbye.
Thank you.
Good luck, sir.
- You okay?
- Sure.
We could make a run for it, you know.
Catch the first plane out of Dulles, head to Panama.
- I hear Uruguay's nice.
- Southern Hemisphere.
- It's summer there.
- Cheaper housing.
- You speak the language.
- What about the kids?
- We'll send them a postcard.
- They'll be pissed.
- I left enough time.
- No, you didn't.
- I was ready before they got here.
- Because they're running late.
When was the last time someone actually was late to meet us?
Eight years ago to the day.
Get used to it.
It's gonna happen a lot more.
The girls are gonna be waiting for us when we get to the farm this evening.
It's supposed to be a surprise.
Act like it.
Tonight?
I was looking forward to some peace and quiet.
I know.
That's why I'm warning you.
I don't want you to look stricken when you see them.
Does it have to be tonight?
They just wanted to show you their love and support in your hour of need.
Afraid you might have re-entry issues, returning to live amongst us mortals.
Have I been so out of touch?
When was the last time you used a phone?
Or went to a bank?
Or drove a car?
It's just like riding a bike, only more horsepower, right?
Excuse me, Mr. President?
The Santoses have arrived.
- They're in the Blue Room.
- Thank you.
Abbey?
Nine inaugural balls.
How's that supposed to work?
You want to skip the champagne when they do the toast.
I'm afraid I made a bit of a mess this morning and it may eat into your news cycle.
- The pardons.
- Granny Pot.
I heard.
And a few others.
- How's the speech?
- It's okay.
Couple of good lines.
There's no "Ask not what your country can do for you," but...
J.F.K. Really screwed us with that one, didn't he?
Have you chosen a biblical quotation for the oath?
Kings Three.
Nine to 11.
Grant thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people?
- That's the one.
- Good choice.
You know what I'm gonna miss the most?
The Marine Corps Band.
Those guys can really play.
Ask them to do "Semper Fidelis." They'll knock your socks off.
Mr. President, Senator Wirth will escort you to the podium.
This way, Mr. President-Elect.
I guess this is where our paths diverge.
- Sure you're ready to retire?
- See you on the podium.
Mr. President-Elect.
Capitol Police estimate today's crowd at over 140,000 with an additional 800,000 expected to line the parade route later.
Incoming Secretary of State, Arnold Vinick, is here.
Senator Vinick surprised many Republicans surprised everyone across the board by accepting a position in Matt Santos ' cabinet perhaps eschewing his own chances to run again in four years.
- It's gonna be cold out there.
- Yeah.
I hope brevity is in order.
I cut the speech down to about 80 pages in the car.
Gettysburg Address was what, four minutes long?
Lot of run-on sentences, though.
Didn't a two-hour inaugural address kill a president once?
William Henry Harrison.
But, yeah, he was 68 and he refused to wear a coat.
You refuse to wear a coat.
But I'm wearing long underwear.
The dignitaries on the platform have taken their positions.
And now, here are President Bartlet and the first lady making their way to their seats on the podium.
After eight years in the White House, they're handing over the reins to the Santoses in a few short minutes.
C.J.?
The president's office just sent this over, says it needs to go to the Pardon Attorney.
- The president surprised both supporters and critics with his willingness to use force abroad and his aggressive pursuit of peace on the world stage.
Man, I hope Janet Spragens has her TV on.
- Who?
- Senior year.
She beat me for the last varsity spot on the swim team.
- Guess what.
- What?
You win.
Well, she did get Don Vogel to take her to the prom instead of me.
We'll call it even then.
No.
I'm pretty sure Janet had to put out so Don would take her.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Helen Santos.
No turning back now.
Ladies and gentlemen, President-Elect of the United States Matthew Vincente Santos.
O Lord, we come together on this historic and solemn occasion to inaugurate a president.
We pray, O Lord, for President-Elect Santos to whom you have entrusted leadership of this great nation.
Give our new president and all who advise him calmness in the face of storms encouragement in the face of frustrations and humility in the face of triumph.
We pray that this good and generous country may be a blessing to the nations of the world and fulfill the hopes of our Founding Fathers.
This we ask in your most holy name.
Amen.
Speaker of the House, Mark B. Sellner.
It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court to administer the presidential oath of office.
Please raise your hand and repeat after me.
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States.
I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States.
And will, to the best of my ability...
And will, to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
...preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
So help me, God.
So help me, God.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Good afternoon, sir.
- Hey, Gerald.
- Good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
Home sweet home.
Most important is keeping track of who 's going in and out of the Oval Office.
First thing you'll need to do is establish who'll have walk-in privileges.
Usually it's just the first lady and the chief of staff.
At some point, the president is gonna ask you to take away his wife's privileges.
Don't do it, no matter how much he begs.
You have the right to attend the staff meeting.
I never went, because the senior staff was already appropriately intimidated by my stern visage and dry wit.
But you're young.
You have a baby face.
They are gonna try to walk all over you.
You should go.
Your desk sits right outside this door.
You prepare his schedule.
You decide who goes in and who doesn't.
Your most frequent response to any question will be "no."
Say it with empathy and you'll be fine.
- Where is Mrs. Bartlet?
- Already inside the car, sir.
- Nice speech.
- No J.F.K.
No.
But you've got time.
I left something for you on the desk.
- Just some random thoughts.
- I'll look forward to them, sir.
Make me proud, Mr. President.
I'll do my best, Mr. President.
What in the world was he trying to prove by not wearing an overcoat?
Youth and vigor.
He looked like a leader.
He looked like a lunatic.
A young and vigorous lunatic.
Jed?
You made it.
You're still here.
Yeah.
I'm still here.
As they headed to the parade here on Pennsylvania Avenue the president and first lady...
- This 137-B?
- Yeah.
- This gonna be you?
- Looks like it.
- Charlie Young.
- Bram Howard.
- Parade almost over?
- Yep.
Watch out for the thermostat.
Hair one way or the other is the difference between convection oven and meat locker.
- Have fun.
- You bet.
You wanna go see a movie?
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.
You got anything better to do?
No, I guess we don't.
Is there a movie theater around here?
I have no idea.
You look good up there.
Thanks.
- We missed you.
- Can't say the feeling's mutual.
President Bartlet pardoned Toby Ziegler.
Any comment?
- Nope.
- You have an opinion?
Sure I do.
Unfortunately, the suite that Mrs. Bartlet was using is going to be torn up for most of the next year while we restore the marble and original moldings.
We're hoping that this suite will meet with Mrs. Santos' approval.
Nice.
The office for the first lady's press secretary would be over here.
- Great, thanks.
Ms. Moss, if you'll follow me.
We hope this will meet with your approval.
Oh, it's lovely.
I'm sure the first lady will be very happy here.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
The first lady's office is next door.
As her chief of staff, this would be your office.
Yes.
This will be fine.
Shall we get started with the Joint Chiefs, sir?
Yes, thank you.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Do you work in there?
- I'm sorry.
What?
We saw you come out the gate.
- You work at the White House?
- No.
No.
I'm sorry, I don't.
Must be something, huh?
Yeah.
Something.
General, admirals, we'll talk about this more in detail tomorrow.
I do appreciate your candor.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
They want 10,000 more troops in Kazakhstan on the ground for logistical support.
Public opinion is already divided over our mission in Central Asia.
Do you want more troops on the ground in your first week?
We may not have a choice.
- What?
- You look good back there.
Excuse me, sir.
It's almost 6.
The first lady called to remind you to change for the inaugural balls.
Thanks.
Tell her I'll be up there in 15 minutes.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
What's next?
Sir, the Senate Democrats wish to move fast on the education bill...
Come in.
Colonel says we'll land in New Hampshire in 20 minutes, sir.
Thank you.
What are you thinking about?
Tomorrow.

Quiet.
I notice too, Stupid, we're each of us breathing in and out.
It's Bullock, Star, Utter, and Trixie.
And Harry Manning's outside on a sorrel.
- What's the whore doing with 'em?
- I don't know.
They ain't fucking her.
What the fuck is afoot in that hardware store?
Facing the dawn united, we're even odds for disaster, let alone in fuckin' factions.
Knowing him for an arrant maniac,
I'll still not believe Bullock doubts me.
"Certain dangers meet to be faced only by the decent and decorous"... or idiocy of that fuckin' ilk... is what must have captured his thinking, this fuckin' jerk.
I'm going over there.
I am going the fuck over.
Let them fucking try to exclude me, huh?
You know, saying I like you hefty don't mean you couldn't stand losing a couple of fuckin' pounds.
Whatever you'd have me scrutinize must wait until certain cocksuckers have received a piece of my mind.
- Of whom do you speak?
- Why are you walking backwards?
The ink's not yet dry, and I'd have your attention to the article
- at the top right corner.
- Stop fuckin' moving then.
Oh, thank you.
- How's the fuckin' ribs?
- Very painful.
Yeah, right there.
No rooms to let.
Only taking the air.
Well, go away.
I'm at prayer.
If that's not a lie as I situate on the common, what claim has your piety on my deference?
Fuck yourself!
Fuck you, sir, who'd prevent expedition of one's life's disarray.
Telegram for Mr. Swearengen.
A superfluous trumpeting, Mr. Blazanov, as we three are alone.
Do I accomplish my purpose, Al, as to the shooting at Mrs. Ellsworth?
Short of accusation, do I waft the odor
- of complicity at Hearst's direction...
- Give me the telegram.
...to settle not only upon his clothing, but as it were, on the man himself, in the very fabric of his being.
- This is bullshit!
- I'm sorry.
"23 men hired, all on our way." This squaw-fuckin' idiot... proves in eight words he's incompetent and a fuckin' liar.
He can't have got Adams' telegram more than four hours ago, yet he expects me to believe that in four hours he can prudently assess the qualities of 23 hires.
And you know what "on our way" means, huh?
No.
"On our way" means they're getting drunk and blown in some saloon in Cheyenne and running their mouths about this big fuckin' filibustering expedition they're being commissioned for under the command of the famous Hawkeye... the laziest, most shit-faced
whore-mongering cocksucker to ever piss my money away!
Please do not strike me.
Have you finished the article, Al?
That I have not wiped his expectoration from my cheek is understandable.
I'm threatened with death if I do.
That I stand immobile these hours later speaks of a flaw in my will.
Surely this is not the culminating indignity.
There remains, for example, receiving his regurgitations or swallowing his feces!
Would I stand stoic... still?
I am going to fuck you up.
I'm gonna fuck you up.
And I'm the kind of cunt you'll let close.
Quit it, Richardson.
- Is it all right then, the article?
- Perfect.
Fuckin' wafts just the way you want it to.
I'll go ahead and publish then.
I gotta get to the fuckin' hardware store!
- Jack.
- Young man?
At the soul's dark hour?
Name one that fuckin' ain't.
- Mr. Langrishe.
- Yes.
We're going in there, E.B.
Shall I join you, as we all seem up and about?
Excuse me... gentlemen.
Waiting for the sheriff.
We campaign in Sturgis.
Hmm.
A meeting, I gather, of the upper fucking crust exclusively.
- No hoi polloi need apply.
- I ought to have called you.
What events in the camp would argue I be called back from Sturgis is
- what we are trying to decide.
- It's not a meeting at all, per se.
Now I don't feel so horribly injured.
The meeting per se is what he'll not be kept from.
Jack Langrishe.
He's all right.
You showed perfect judgment, sir.
I'd keep from the camp that your janissaries have arrived.
We'll quarter at your find.
- Ah...
Will you drink?
- No, thank you.
I will.
Shall we leave it being generally vigilant?
Under very specific circumstances we'll wire you to make early return.
Yes.
That's exactly it.
And those would be?
Any further shooting out of the ordinary.
- Like at Mrs. Ellsworth, definitely.
- Hearst-initiated horseshit
- of any sort.
- Intimidation or the like.
If it looks to eventuate in immediate violence.
Otherwise why try even to make it to Sturgis for the speeches?
Hearst-initiated bullshit is inevitable is his point.
Surely, sir, you leave in the certain knowledge that you are the camp's irreplaceable man.
He don't need no further encouragement in that way of thinking.
Comes to sending a wire,
I put that Russian ill at ease.
Oh, I do all right with him.
My meetings...
I provide refreshments.
You were shown the tent of the man I want killed first.
- Looked fine, how he wants to work it.
- Ah.
- I'm leaving.
- Come in.
- It's too much.
He's too cruel.
- Come in.
Brazenly sends the other packing, to brazenly install her replacement in the theater.
How was he brazen with the one who left?
No one with eyes could fail to recognize their connection.
- And now brazenly...
- Us recognizing his connection to the one who left does not mean he was brazen.
Fine.
Fine then.
I just came to say goodbye.
Must I agree he is brazen for you to not leave the troupe?
He has no respect for art.
Claudia.
- He hates me.
- No.
I was well-received in Denver.
Yeah, very well received.
I could have stayed.
I could have let you all go on.
I think you were approached by Millerick.
I was.
Go to sleep, Claudia.
No coaches now anyhow.
Did he suspect
Millerick approached me?
He doesn't miss much.
He misses everything.
I juggled at Amateur Night.
And what are you doing now?
Praying for my loved ones.
How nice.
Lucky them.
Would my conversating with her or lingering after supper have disrupted the little one's routine on a day that had been disrupted previous?
Yes.
Already she'd seen a series of people taking up watch to protect that schoolhouse, and how many questions must have occurred to her... because that is a bright child...
"What is transpiring that we need guarding from?"
And what memories must that have brought back of her own dear family murdered in a sudden fake Indian depredation by shit-heel fuckin' road agents.
Not solely how would I like to be passing the evening, the like.
When I've left, have I given the mother more calming down to do before she gets the child asleep?
Them's the sort of things is what you have to consider.
Fuck, must you hover, fucking Merrick?
I admit to wondering, Al, if you have any further impression of my article.
Didn't I tell you how well it wafted?
- If on second reading...
- Oh, Merrick, it's a good article.
It'll no doubt irritate him, fucking Hearst, but I'm wakeful wondering who he's likely to shoot at next, so with regard to that I've gave your article all the thought I need to.
Who do you think he might shoot at?
I have no fucking idea, Merrick.
I doubt it'll be long before we find out, and in the fucking interval until we do,
I guess I'll just have to abandon any prospect of finding respite in any part of your rag
I could just fucking read without having to evaluate how it fucking wafts!
Oh, which leaves me the solace of contemplating the journeying hither of the intrepid fucking Hawkeye and his 23 fucking reprobates to even the odds in the coming combat.
Didn't tell you that, did I, Adams?
Hawkeye's wired to announce he's on his way.
Does that sound likely to you or does it confirm our deepest doubts about his incompetence and veracity?
And mine, in turn, about you that I allowed to fucking vouch for him!
Couldn't let him read his fucking paper.
26... 27... 28.
Uh, not counting them soldiers or Yankton's commissioner.
I won't be lingering once we've finished.
If you want to stay and politic, you'll have to ride back alone.
I hate what happened in your home.
It's all right.
Your wife good enough to ask me in for breakfast.
- I'm working on my presentation.
- That lovely woman putting her hand behind her for support when I feared
- she might fall to the floor.
- Would you shut up about it?
And then, even if only briefly, to have failed to acknowledge it had been my wind,
I'd...
What's your purpose here?
What do you mean?
There's no Sioux around here.
Shall I go find some, ask 'em to join us?
I'm saying there's no fort and there's no Sioux.
Why would they have you bivouacked?
Seems like you got me confused for a general.
Don't be grazing by the windows.
Come in and listen or stay the fuck out of sight.
I guess you got yourself mistaken for a general.
He wants to know what we're here for.
We're here for the election, maybe gonna exercise the franchise.
Time for us to speak now, Sheriff.
Have they told you yet who you're voting for?
Not yet.
Sheriff, we...
Shut up, Harry.
Mr. Utter!
Mr...
The key got stuck.
Ready for fucking Freddie?
Hearst let his dogs loose.
Davey, get to the Russian.
Tell him to wire Sturgis.
Say to wire Bullock as agreed, huh?
I want my child.
I'll...
I'll go get her now.
Mr. Ellsworth...
Mr. Ellsworth's been shot.
- Mr. Ellsworth's been killed.
- I want my child!
She'll be here with you before you know it, Mrs. Ellsworth.
Oh, what did I do to him?
We'll go upstairs, get you a drink.
What did I do to that poor man?
You didn't fucking shoot him.
And don't be going off into fucking hysterics, huh?
Collect your child.
Utter will be back with her here any minute.
Come on.
I'm going to make her breakfast.
Pinchbeck motherfucker.
My goodness!
Bare-breasted.
My word.
Who has commissioned such behavior?
Who summons you with such power to do his will?
Mr. Hearst?
Mr. Hearst?
Did someone interrupted your rendezvous?
Did someone else attack him?
Cover those things.
Give me your fucking poot-butt gun.
- Why?
- Fucking shoot me with it if you don't.
- What's going on, Trixie?
- Ellsworth's murdered, and I fucking shot Hearst, and I don't think I killed him!
Shoot me or he'll do for all of us.
- Shoot me!
Shoot me!
- Shh.
- Don't you fucking take me anywhere!
- Shut up!
Stand the fuck up!
I piss hard-stole money away to gussy you fucking cunts up.
Starchy bullshit.
And fucking pretend there's a difference between fat ass snatch and fat ass snatch
- in a fucking petticoat!
- Come on, Mr. T.
Where are we going, you rummy-faced piece of shit?
!
I'm just saying...
Just saying what?
What were you just saying?
I don't know, sir.
Weren't you being this fat twat's gallant?
Ain't Con the nuts, fatso?
Ain't it great to have a fucking beau?
I'm Seth Bullock.
In Montana, I had a hardware business with my partner Sol Star, and we do the same in Deadwood, which we came to in '76.
I was Marshal and Territorial Delegate in Montana, and I'm Health Commissioner and Sheriff where we are now.
With The Hills now part of the new territory,
I run for Sheriff of the new organized county.
If elected, my intention's to look to the good and safety of people hereabouts.
I will venture my life that law-abiding persons will be secure in their rights and their property.
I have to go.
- What is it, Bullock?
What happened?
- Don't you know?
Have they just got you handling the votes?
The voting exclusively.
He's dead.
Dead!
And at my hands!
- Or the next thing to it.
- Who?
- Hearst!
- He's dead?
- I think.
- Boss!
Excuse me.
The gimp's making breakfast for you, if you ain't eaten yet.
Jewel.
- Well, where was he hit?
- I don't know.
Trixie shot him.
- Boss!
- Trixie said she killed him?
E.B. said Trixie killed Hearst!
- You saw him dead?
- No.
- How bad was he hurt?
- I'm not sure.
Well, how bad did Trixie say he was hurt?
If he wasn't hurt, wouldn't I have seen him pursue her?
What you mean is she might not have fucking shot him at all!
Four steps removed.
No fucking closer.
Boss.
- Or w-wouldn't he have?
- Wouldn't he have what?
Shut up, E.B.
- I'm a dead man.
- You ain't gonna be alone.
- I've made this fucking walk before.
- All right.
- Stay here till I get him.
- Then you get out!
Get out with your hovering and fucking clucking!
Before hell breaks fucking loose.
Trixie's here, in back.
Your idea, her coming here?
My fucking idea, after she did what she did.
Was it your idea to have her do that?
All right.
Loopy fucking cunt.
Mother's upstairs.
Get out of the fucking way, Jewel.
- Here, let me take it up.
- No, you fucking won't.
Oh for Christ's sake.
Mr. Utter's come with the child.
Getting another plate.
Mr. Utter said only that Sofia's mother had requested her at The Gem.
Rely that something fucked has transpired... with Mose God knows where, and me likely needed in camp.
- Uh, go ahead, Jane.
- I'll stay with Mrs. Bullock.
Trouble jumps off, ring the bell.
That'll bring me fucking running.
All right.
Or I guess maybe I'll just stay instead.
I suppose there's some connection between his condition and yours.
That bare-breasted woman who shot me seemed to think there ought to be.
Shit!
Go ahead, knowing I'd appreciate less enthusiasm.
Through the years, that fellow's path and mine crossed several times.
I never meant him a moment's harm, but the natural operation of my holdings and his bad luck brought me to figure in his imagination as some sort of bogey.
Mmm.
I expect my attacker was a bawd connected somehow to the man in back before he married so luckily.
Likely, she fell victim as he did to imagining me responsible for the change in her situation.
God damn it!
Often, because our interests are extensive, people like me are believed the authors of events which may benefit our holdings, when our connection in fact is incidental.
God damn it!
Whew, ahh.
I have some calls to make.
Will your gunmen let me pass?
Of course.
Don't you want to dress the wound?
My name is Joseanne.
Mr. Langrishe was so generous to say he would install me today in the theater.
Sit down, dear.
Oh!
We are waiting for him.
One of our chief occupations.
Mr. Farnum!
Ah, good day, sir.
Mr. Farnum, a little while ago
I heard what I took for a gunshot... an impression, I remark, not on the grounds of its uniqueness, but for the shot having seemed to issue from so near to my recumbent ear...
You are not mistaken, sir.
...the hallway, that is to say, separated from where I rested only by a wall whose thinness you've no doubt had others before me deplore.
The walls do thicken in our west wing.
I'll have a quick look for vacancies.
Hearst shot, the wound, alas, not mortal.
"No help," as we say at the tables.
Booth... never went you better.
Anon anon, sir.
Anon anon.
God damn it, Richardson.
You're too ugly to be sneaking up on fucking people.
From Mrs. Marchbanks.
We got all the fucking food we need.
Who the fuck is Mrs. Marchbanks anyway?
It's Aunt Lou.
I guess I'd know her for Mrs. Marchbanks if she took time to introduce herself.
Tell the arrogant nigger thanks.
No hurry returning the basket.
Tell her my fucking name's Miss Caulfield...
I think.
The terms come clear.
If she'd keep her property here, she'll leave, having first hired as many as Hearst has, and who can kill as well as his do and ain't disadvantaged too, to keep Hearst from killing her,
which...
by the shots yesterday and Ellsworth butchered today... means her to understand Hearst will not cease endeavoring to do.
But if she'd herself stay in camp, she must sell her property to him.
A very pithy rendering.
I want to feel his beard.
Mr. Ellsworth's with God now, Sofia.
I want to feel his beard so I can pray that he's saying goodbye to me.
Duck duck duck duck duck.
- Goose.
- Go, James, go!
Go, James, go!
Go, James, go!
Go, James!
Yay!
Aw.
Outflanked by a boy half my size.
Next time I'll get you, James.
Ellsworth's murdered, head-shot at the Garret find.
Your partner's sweetheart put one in Hearst's shoulder.
- Where's Mrs. Ellsworth?
- Above with the child.
- With the child.
- I fucking heard ya.
He once had something to do with her.
Reason for his making the case she sell, keep her here for another swing.
Reason ain't his long suit.
Bullet removed uneventfully.
Let's pray he avoids infection.
What did Hearst say of the shooting?
That some bawd still connected to Ellsworth must have blamed him for the murder.
Wrongheaded and fallen in the bargain.
Would you find pretext to let the mother know I'm here?
- Bullock's with her.
- Shall I shout out and ask it of him?
Very much in your line, this type thing?
Yes.
Not to my taste at all.
Times past, one's fled.
Doc's here.
Someone fell.
Will you excuse me for a moment, darling?
I want to see Mr. Ellsworth.
Excuse me.
Are you certain that she saw her family dead?
Yes.
I certainly assume she did.
The man I once was, Al, was not formidable, and I am but his shadow now.
And yet I'd be put to use.
A decoy, perhaps.
A weight to drop on villains from above.
As I heard the account, the child was found inside a hollowed-out tree trunk some distance from the others.
Having crawled from the carnage and hidden herself,
I'd always assumed.
I suppose, rather than Sofia crawling unseen from the carnage, the possibility might exist that the family hid her in the tree trunk and then fled that distance before the murderers fell upon them.
For the child to have been found having been savaged by wolves, those hours later by strangers, and then taken away having never seen her family again, living or dead...
I can fix that.
Slainte.
Thought you was near pitching a tent and setting up housekeeping over on that first step.
You sound like a pig my cousin run off with.
Get another?
If that cocksucker hadn't shareholders, you could murder him while you adjusted his back.
Serpent's teeth...
shareholders.
10,000 would rise to replace him.
All right, darling.
All right.
Monitor my thinking, Jack.
Oh, no warrant as to competence.
Had Hearst wanted this woman killed, she'd be dead already.
Agree.
The husband's murdered to coerce her to sell.
For the moment, the child's safe too, huh?
Pending the mother's decision... agree.
- Safe then to let 'em go, huh?
- I would, sir.
Yes.
Gonna take Mrs. Ellsworth home.
As you think best.
I wish to thank you again, Mr. Swearengen.
We are all very grateful.
Trixie's with Star at his place.
No one knows but Shaunessey, who lives in fucking terror of me, huh?
Passages between their places only Shaunessey knows.
Heartfelt condolences, madam.
I get to see Mr. Ellsworth tomorrow.
Very good, young lady.
God bless.
You take care of them, Bullock.
Leave the other to me, huh?
Oh, Bullock, you might want to stand guard outside her place.
- I'll take Charlie as backup.
- Hearst ain't gonna be coming for her.
But to bring the matter home as grave, it'd make a case for her selling her claim.
Not to jeopardize the tranquility of your own hearth.
Thank you for looking to them.
Nimbleness, lad, dexterity.
I'd prefer Hearst's advantage at arms.
True true.
The world is less than perfect.
The camp is galvanized.
People scurry about.
They've tasks to perform.
They feel important.
I oughtn't to work in these places.
I was not born to crush my own kind.
Right with you, Wu.
In there.
In there.
First door.
Yeah, in there.
When he leaves, them that ain't lining this fucking hallway like he's the tallest, best-looking white man ever got fucking lucky better prepare for a fucking beating.
Wu...
Custer City... brings back all his Chinks the fuck back to Deadwood.
Wu... back Deadwood?
Brings all his Chinks back, huh?
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood!
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday!
10 day, Swedgin!
I am sorry, Wu.
I'm sorry I made you wait.
But I want you to bring them now.
While you're about your journey,
I'll be trying to conceive some practical use for your countrymen's arrival besides seeming to swell our ranks.
Oh, we'll give 'em guns, yeah.
We'll provide 'em with guns, so any of the slant-eyed bastards know what one is, or, perish the thought, know how to use one... we'll enhance our prospects.
Guns.
Chung Kuo.
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood.
150 Chung Kuo cocksucker, Swedgin.
Shut the fuck up, Wu.
Heng dai.
Heng dai.
Heng dai, fucking Wu.
Big man.
Wu... big man.
Rouse him to spend on pussy, or rob the son of a bitch.

And how many questions must have occurred to her-- because that is a bright child.
"What is transpiring that we need guarding from?"
And what memories must that have brought back of her own dear family murdered in a sudden fake Indian depredation by shit-heel fuckin' road agents.
Not solely how would I like to be passing the evening, the like.
When I've left, have I given the mother more calming down to do before she gets the child asleep?
Them's the sort of things is what you have to consider.
(dog whimpers)
Fuck, must you hover, fucking Merrick?
I admit to wondering, Al, if you have any further impression of my article.
- Didn't I tell you how well it wafted?
- If on second reading--
Merrick, it's a good article.
It'll no doubt irritate him, fucking Hearst.
But I'm wakeful wondering who he's likely to shoot at next, so with regard to that I've gave your article all the thought I need to.
Who do you think he might shoot at?
I have no fucking idea, Merrick.
I doubt it'll be long before we find out.
And in the fucking interval until we do,
I guess I'll just have to abandon any prospect of finding respite in any part of your rag I could just fucking read without having to evaluate how it fucking wafts!
Oh, which leaves me the solace of contemplating the journeying hither of the intrepid fucking Hawkeye and his 23 fucking reprobates to even the odds in the coming combat.
Didn't tell you that, did I, Adams?
Hawkeye's wired to announce he's on his way.
Does that sound likely to you or does it confirm our deepest doubts about his incompetence and veracity?
And mine, in turn, about you that I allowed to fucking vouch for him!
?
Couldn't let him read his fucking paper?
(Harry mumbling)
26... 27... 28.
Uh, not counting them soldiers or Yankton's commissioner.
I won't be lingering once we've finished.
If you want to stay and politic, you'll have to ride back alone.
I hate what happened in your home.
It's all right.
Your wife good enough to ask me in for breakfast.
- I'm working on my presentation.
- That lovely woman putting her hand behind her for support
- when I feared she might fall to the floor.
- Won't you shut up about it?
And then, even if only briefly, to have failed to acknowledge it had been my wind, I'd--
What's your purpose here?
- What do you mean?
- There's no Sioux around here.
Shall I go find some, ask 'em to join us?
I'm saying there's no fort and there's no Sioux.
Why would they have you bivouacked?
Seems like you got me confused for a general.
(clears throat)
Don't be grazing by the windows.
Come in and listen or stay the fuck out of sight.
I guess you got yourself mistaken for a general.
Soldier:
He wants to know what we're here for.
We're here for the election.
Maybe gonna exercise a franchise.
(clears throat)
Time for us to speak now, Sheriff.
Have they told you yet who you're voting for?
Not yet.
Sheriff, we--
Shut up, Harry.
(gasping)
Mr. Utter!
Mr.--
(crying)
(lock jiggling)
The key got stuck.
Ready for fucking Freddie?
Hearst let his dogs loose.
Davey, get to the Russian.
Tell him to wire Sturgis.
Say to wire Bullock as agreed, huh?
- (sobbing) I want my child.
- I'll-
- I'll go get her now.
Mrs. Ellsworth, I'll go-- Mr. Ellsworth's been shot.
- Mr. Ellsworth's been killed.
- I want my child!
She'll be here with you before you know it, Mrs. Ellsworth.
- Oh, what did I do to him?
- We'll go upstairs, get you a drink.
What did I do to that poor man?
You didn't fucking shoot him.
And don't be going off into fucking hysterics, huh?
Collect your child.
Utter will be back with her here any minute.
Come on.
I'm going to make her breakfast.
Pinchbeck motherfucker.
My goodness!
Bare-breasted.
My word.
Who has commissioned such behavior?
Who summons you with such power to do his will?
Trixie:
Mr. Hearst?
Mr. Hearst?
(gunshot)
Did someone interrupted your rendezvous?
Did someone else attack him?
Cover those things.
(grunts)
Give me your fucking poot-butt gun.
- Why?
- Fucking shoot me with it if you don't.
- What's going on, Trixie?
- Ellsworth's murdered, and I fucking shot Hearst and I don't think I killed him!
Shoot me or he'll do for all of us.
- Shoot me!
Shoot me!
- Shh.
- Don't you fucking take me anywhere!
- Shut up!
Cy:
Stand the fuck up!
I piss hard-stole money away to gussy you fucking cunts up.
Starchy bullshit.
We fucking pretend there's a difference between fat-ass snatch and fat-ass snatch in a fucking petticoat!
Come on, Mr. T--
Where are we going, you rummy-faced piece of shit?
!
I'm just saying--
Just saying what?
What were you just saying?
I don't know, sir.
Weren't you being this fat twat's gallant?
Ain't Con the nuts, fatso?
Ain't it great to have a fucking beau?
I'm Seth Bullock.
In Montana I had a hardware business with my partner Sol Star, and we do the same in Deadwood, which we came to in '76.
I was Marshal and Territorial Delegate in Montana, and I'm Health Commissioner and Sheriff where we are now.
With the Hills now part of the new territory,
I run for Sheriff of the new organized county.
If elected, my intention's to look to the good and safety of people hereabouts.
I will venture my life that law-abiding persons will be secure in their rights and their property.
I have to go.
(audience murmuring)
What is it, Bullock?
What happened?
Don't you know?
Have they just got you handling the votes?
The voting exclusively.
He's dead.
Dead!
And at my hands!
- Or the next thing to it.
- Who?
- Hearst!
- He's dead?
- I think.
- Boss!
Excuse me.
The gimp's making breakfast for you, if you ain't et yet-
- Jewel.
- Where was he hit?
- I don't know.
Trixie shot him.
- Dan:
Boss!
- Trixie said she killed him?
EB said Trixie killed Hearst!
- You saw him dead?
- No.
(sighs) How bad was he hurt?
- I'm not sure.
- How bad did Trixie say he was hurt?
If he wasn't hurt, wouldn't I have seen him pursue her?
What you mean is she might not have fucking shot him at all!
Four steps removed.
No fucking closer.
Boss.
- Or w-wouldn't he have?
- Johnny:
Wouldn't he have what?
Al:
Shut up, EB.
- I'm a dead man.
- You ain't gonna be alone.
- Trixie:
I've made this fucking walk before.
- All right.
- Stay here till I get him.
- Then you get out!
Get out with your hovering and fucking clucking!
(door closes)
Before hell breaks fucking loose.
Trixie's here, in back.
Your idea, her coming here?
My fucking idea, after she did what she did.
Was it your idea to have her do that?
All right.
Loopy fucking cunt.
Mother's upstairs.
Get out of the fucking way, Jewel.
- Here, let me take it up.
- No, you fucking won't.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Mr. Utter's come with the child.
(Sofia crying)
Getting another plate.
(whispering) Mr. Utter said only that Sofia's mother had requested her at The Gem.
Rely that something fucked has transpired... with Mose God knows where, and me likely needed in camp.
- Uh, go ahead, Jane.
- I'll stay with Mrs. Bullock.
Trouble jumps off, ring the bell.
That'll bring me fucking running.
All right.
Or I guess maybe I'll just stay instead.
Doc:
I suppose there's some connection between his condition and yours.
That bare-breasted woman who shot me seemed to think there ought to be.
(groans) Shit!
Go ahead, knowing I'd appreciate less enthusiasm.
(groans)
Through the years, that fellow's path and mine crossed several times.
I never meant him a moment's harm, but the natural operation of my holdings and his bad luck brought me to figure in his imagination as some sort of bogey.
(groans)
I expect my attacker was a bawd connected somehow to the man in back before he married so luckily.
Likely, she fell victim, as he did, to imagining me responsible for the change in her situation.
(straining) God damn it!
Often, because our interests are extensive, people like me are believed the authors of events which may benefit our holdings, when our connection in fact is incidental.
God damn it!
(grunts)
(laughs) Whew, ahh.
I have some calls to make.
Will your gunmen let me pass?
Of course.
Don't you want dress the wound?
My name is Josiane.
Mr. Langrishe was so generous to say he would install me today in the theater.
Sit down, dear.
Oh!
We are waiting for him.
One of our chief occupations.
Langrishe:
Mr. Farnum!
Ah, good day, sir.
Mr. Farnum, a little while ago
I heard what I took for a gunshot-- an impression I remark not on the grounds of its uniqueness, but for the shot having seemed to issue from so near to my recumbent ear...
You are not mistaken, sir.
...the hallway, that is to say, separated from where I rested only by a wall whose thinness you've no doubt heard others before me deplore.
The walls do thicken in our west wing.
I'll have a quick look for vacancies.
Hearst shot;
the wound, alas, not mortal.
"No help," as we say at the tables.
Booth never went you better.
Anon anon, sir.
Anon anon.
God damn it, Richardson.
You're too ugly to be sneaking up on fucking people.
From Mrs. Marchbanks.
We got all the fucking food we need.
Who the fuck is Mrs. Marchbanks anyway?
It's Aunt Lou.
I guess I'd know her for Mrs. Marchbanks if she took time to introduce herself.
Tell the arrogant nigger thanks.
No hurry returning the basket.
Tell her my fucking name's Miss Caulfield...
I think.
The terms come clear.
If she'd keep her property here, she'll leave, having first hired as many as Hearst has and who can kill as well as his do, and ain't disadvantaged too to keep Hearst from killing her, which by the shots yesterday
and Ellsworth butchered today means her to understand Hearst will not cease endeavoring to do.
But if she'd herself stay in camp, she must sell her property to him.
A very pithy rendering.
(whispers) I want to feel his beard.
Mr. Ellsworth's with God now, Sofia.
I want to feel his beard so I can pray that he's saying goodbye to me.
Duck duck duck duck duck.
- Goose.
- Class:
Go, James, go!
Go, James, go!
Go, James, go!
Go, James!
Class:
Yay!
Aw.
Outflanked by a boy half my size.
Next time I'll get you, James.
Ellsworth's murdered, head-shot at the Garret find.
Your partner's sweetheart put one in Hearst's shoulder.
- Where's Mrs. Ellsworth?
- Above with the child.
- With the child.
- I fucking heard ya.
He once had something to do with her.
Reason for his making the case she sell, keep her here for another swing.
Reason ain't his long suit.
(gasps)
(sobbing)
(Doc coughing)
Bullet removed uneventfully.
Let's pray he avoids infection.
What did Hearst say of the shooting?
That some bawd still connected to Ellsworth must have blamed him for the murder.
Wrongheaded and fallen in the bargain.
Would you find pretext to let the mother know I'm here?
- Bullock's with her.
- Shall I shout out and ask it of him?
Very much in your line, this type thing?
Yes.
Not to my taste at all.
Times past, one's fled.
(knock on door)
Doc's here.
Someone fell.
Will you excuse me for a moment, darling?
I want to see Mr. Ellsworth.
Excuse me.
(grunting)
(humming)
Are you certain that she saw her family dead?
Yes.
I certainly assume she did.
The man I once was, Al, was not formidable, and I am but his shadow now, and yet I'd be put to use.
A decoy, perhaps.
A weight to drop on villains from above.
As I heard the account, the child was found inside a hollowed-out tree trunk some distance from the others.
Having crawled from the carnage and hidden herself,
I'd always assumed.
See, I suppose, rather than Sofia crawling unseen from the carnage, the possibility might exist that the family hid her in the tree trunk and then fled that distance before the murderers fell upon them.
For the child to have been found having been savaged by wolves, those hours later by strangers, and then taken away having never seen her family again, living or dead...
(sniffs)
I can fix that.
Slainte.
Thought you was near pitching a tent and setting up housekeeping over on that first step.
(snickers)
You sound like a pig my cousin run off with.
Get another?
If that cocksucker hadn't shareholders, you could murder him while you adjusted his back.
Serpent's teeth-- shareholders.
10,000 would rise to replace him.
All right, darling.
All right.
- Monitor my thinking, Jack.
- Oh, no warrant as to competence.
Had Hearst wanted this woman killed, she'd be dead already.
Agree.
The husband's murdered to coerce her to sell.
Al:
For the moment, the child's safe too, huh?
- Pending the mother's decision-- agree.
- Safe then to let 'em go, huh?
I would, sir.
Yes.
Gonna take Mrs. Ellsworth home.
As you think best.
I wish to thank you again, Mr. Swearengen.
We are all very grateful.
Trixie's with Star at his place.
No one knows but Shaunessey, who lives in fucking terror of me, huh?
Passages between their places only Shaunessey knows.
Heartfelt condolences, madam.
I get to see Mr. Ellsworth tomorrow.
Very good, young lady.
God bless.
You take care of them, Bullock.
Leave the other to me, huh?
Oh, Bullock, you might want to stand guard outside her place.
- I'll take Charlie as backup.
- No, Hearst ain't gonna be coming for her, but to bring the matter home as grave.
It'd make a case for her selling her claim not to jeopardize the tranquility of your own hearth.
Thank you for looking to them.
Nimbleness, lad, dexterity.
I'd prefer Hearst's advantage at arms.
True true.
The world is less than perfect.
The camp is galvanized.
People scurry about.
They've tasks to perform.
They feel important.
I oughtn't to work in these places.
I was not born to crush my own kind.
Right with you, Wu.
In there.
In there.
First door.
Yeah, in there.
When he leaves, them that ain't lining this fucking hallway like he's the tallest, best-looking white man ever got fucking lucky better prepare for a fucking beating.
Wu, Custer City, brings back all his Chinks the fuck back to Deadwood.
Wu... back Deadwood?
Brings all his Chinks back, huh?
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood!
(speaks Chinese) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday!
10 day, Swedgin!
I am sorry, Wu.
I'm sorry I made you wait.
But I want you to bring them now.
While you're about your journey,
I'll be trying to conceive some practical use for your countrymen's arrival besides seeming to swell our ranks.
Oh, we'll give 'em guns, yeah?
We'll provide 'em with guns, so any of the slant-eyed bastards know what one is, or, perish the thought, know how to use one-- we'll enhance our prospects.
Guns.
Chung Kuo.
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood, 150 Chung Kuo cocksucker, Swedgin.
Shut the fuck up, Wu.
Heng dai.
Heng dai.
Heng dai, fucking Wu.
Big man.
Wu-- big man.
Rouse him to spend on pussy, or rob the son of a bitch.

Quiet.
I notice too, Stupid, we're each of us breathing in and out.
It's Bullock, Star, Utter, and Trixie.
And Harry Manning's outside on a sorrel.
- What's the whore doing with 'em?
- I don't know.
They ain't fucking her.
What the fuck is afoot in that hardware store?
Facing the dawn united, we're even odds for disaster, let alone in fuckin' factions.
Knowing him for an arrant maniac,
I'll still not believe Bullock doubts me.
"Certain dangers meet to be faced only by the decent and decorous"... or idiocy of that fuckin' ilk... is what must have captured his thinking, this fuckin' jerk.
I'm going over there.
I am going the fuck over.
Let them fucking try to exclude me, huh?
You know, saying I like you hefty don't mean you couldn't stand losing a couple of fuckin' pounds.
Whatever you'd have me scrutinize must wait until certain cocksuckers have received a piece of my mind.
- Of whom do you speak?
- Why are you walking backwards?
The ink's not yet dry, and I'd have your attention to the article
- at the top right corner.
- Stop fuckin' moving then.
Oh, thank you.
- How's the fuckin' ribs?
- Very painful.
Yeah, right there.
No rooms to let.
Only taking the air.
Well, go away.
I'm at prayer.
If that's not a lie as I situate on the common, what claim has your piety on my deference?
Fuck yourself!
Fuck you, sir, who'd prevent expedition of one's life's disarray.
Telegram for Mr. Swearengen.
A superfluous trumpeting, Mr. Blazanov, as we three are alone.
Do I accomplish my purpose, Al, as to the shooting at Mrs. Ellsworth?
Short of accusation, do I waft the odor
- of complicity at Hearst's direction...
- Give me the telegram.
...to settle not only upon his clothing, but as it were, on the man himself, in the very fabric of his being.
- This is bullshit!
- I'm sorry.
"23 men hired, all on our way." This squaw-fuckin' idiot... proves in eight words he's incompetent and a fuckin' liar.
He can't have got Adams' telegram more than four hours ago, yet he expects me to believe that in four hours he can prudently assess the qualities of 23 hires.
And you know what "on our way" means, huh?
No.
"On our way" means they're getting drunk and blown in some saloon in Cheyenne and running their mouths about this big fuckin' filibustering expedition they're being commissioned for under the command of the famous Hawkeye... the laziest, most shit-faced
whore-mongering cocksucker to ever piss my money away!
Please do not strike me.
Have you finished the article, Al?
That I have not wiped his expectoration from my cheek is understandable.
I'm threatened with death if I do.
That I stand immobile these hours later speaks of a flaw in my will.
Surely this is not the culminating indignity.
There remains, for example, receiving his regurgitations or swallowing his feces!
Would I stand stoic... still?
I am going to fuck you up.
I'm gonna fuck you up.
And I'm the kind of cunt you'll let close.
Quit it, Richardson.
- Is it all right then, the article?
- Perfect.
Fuckin' wafts just the way you want it to.
I'll go ahead and publish then.
I gotta get to the fuckin' hardware store!
- Jack.
- Young man?
At the soul's dark hour?
Name one that fuckin' ain't.
- Mr. Langrishe.
- Yes.
We're going in there, E.B.
Shall I join you, as we all seem up and about?
Excuse me... gentlemen.
Waiting for the sheriff.
We campaign in Sturgis.
Hmm.
A meeting, I gather, of the upper fucking crust exclusively.
- No hoi polloi need apply.
- I ought to have called you.
What events in the camp would argue I be called back from Sturgis is
- what we are trying to decide.
- It's not a meeting at all, per se.
Now I don't feel so horribly injured.
The meeting per se is what he'll not be kept from.
Jack Langrishe.
He's all right.
You showed perfect judgment, sir.
I'd keep from the camp that your janissaries have arrived.
We'll quarter at your find.
- Ah...
Will you drink?
- No, thank you.
I will.
Shall we leave it being generally vigilant?
Under very specific circumstances we'll wire you to make early return.
Yes.
That's exactly it.
And those would be?
Any further shooting out of the ordinary.
- Like at Mrs. Ellsworth, definitely.
- Hearst-initiated horseshit
- of any sort.
- Intimidation or the like.
If it looks to eventuate in immediate violence.
Otherwise why try even to make it to Sturgis for the speeches?
Hearst-initiated bullshit is inevitable is his point.
Surely, sir, you leave in the certain knowledge that you are the camp's irreplaceable man.
He don't need no further encouragement in that way of thinking.
Comes to sending a wire,
I put that Russian ill at ease.
Oh, I do all right with him.
My meetings...
I provide refreshments.
You were shown the tent of the man I want killed first.
- Looked fine, how he wants to work it.
- Ah.
- I'm leaving.
- Come in.
- It's too much.
He's too cruel.
- Come in.
Brazenly sends the other packing, to brazenly install her replacement in the theater.
How was he brazen with the one who left?
No one with eyes could fail to recognize their connection.
- And now brazenly...
- Us recognizing his connection to the one who left does not mean he was brazen.
Fine.
Fine then.
I just came to say goodbye.
Must I agree he is brazen for you to not leave the troupe?
He has no respect for art.
Claudia.
- He hates me.
- No.
I was well-received in Denver.
Yeah, very well received.
I could have stayed.
I could have let you all go on.
I think you were approached by Millerick.
I was.
Go to sleep, Claudia.
No coaches now anyhow.
Did he suspect
Millerick approached me?
He doesn't miss much.
He misses everything.
I juggled at Amateur Night.
And what are you doing now?
Praying for my loved ones.
How nice.
Lucky them.
Would my conversating with her or lingering after supper have disrupted the little one's routine on a day that had been disrupted previous?
Yes.
Already she'd seen a series of people taking up watch to protect that schoolhouse, and how many questions must have occurred to her... because that is a bright child...
"What is transpiring that we need guarding from?"
And what memories must that have brought back of her own dear family murdered in a sudden fake Indian depredation by shit-heel fuckin' road agents.
Not solely how would I like to be passing the evening, the like.

It'll no doubt irritate him, fucking Hearst, but I'm wakeful wondering who he's likely to shoot at next, so with regard to that I've gave your article all the thought I need to.
Who do you think he might shoot at?
I have no fucking idea, Merrick.
I doubt it'll be long before we find out, and in the fucking interval until we do,

I could just fucking read without having to evaluate how it fucking wafts!
Oh, which leaves me the solace of contemplating the journeying hither of the intrepid fucking Hawkeye and his 23 fucking reprobates to even the odds in the coming combat.
Didn't tell you that, did I, Adams?
Hawkeye's wired to announce he's on his way.
Does that sound likely to you or does it confirm our deepest doubts about his incompetence and veracity?
And mine, in turn, about you that I allowed to fucking vouch for him!
Couldn't let him read his fucking paper.
26... 27... 28.
Uh, not counting them soldiers or Yankton's commissioner.
I won't be lingering once we've finished.
If you want to stay and politic, you'll have to ride back alone.
I hate what happened in your home.
It's all right.
Your wife good enough to ask me in for breakfast.
- I'm working on my presentation.
- That lovely woman putting her hand behind her for support when I feared
- she might fall to the floor.
- Would you shut up about it?
And then, even if only briefly, to have failed to acknowledge it had been my wind,
I'd...
What's your purpose here?
What do you mean?
There's no Sioux around here.

Have they told you yet who you're voting for?
Not yet.
Sheriff, we...
Shut up, Harry.

Hearst let his dogs loose.
Davey, get to the Russian.
Tell him to wire Sturgis.

Mr. Ellsworth...
Mr. Ellsworth's been shot.

She'll be here with you before you know it, Mrs. Ellsworth.
Oh, what did I do to him?
We'll go upstairs, get you a drink.

- Why?
- Fucking shoot me with it if you don't.
- What's going on, Trixie?
- Ellsworth's murdered, and I fucking shot Hearst, and I don't think I killed him!
Shoot me or he'll do for all of us.
- Shoot me!
Shoot me!
- Shh.
- Don't you fucking take me anywhere!
- Shut up!
Stand the fuck up!
I piss hard-stole money away to gussy you fucking cunts up.
Starchy bullshit.
And fucking pretend there's a difference between fat ass snatch and fat ass snatch
- in a fucking petticoat!
- Come on, Mr. T.
Where are we going, you rummy-faced piece of shit?
!
I'm just saying...
Just saying what?
What were you just saying?

I will venture my life that law-abiding persons will be secure in their rights and their property.
I have to go.
- What is it, Bullock?
What happened?
- Don't you know?
Have they just got you handling the votes?
The voting exclusively.
He's dead.
Dead!
And at my hands!
- Or the next thing to it.
- Who?
- Hearst!
- He's dead?
- I think.
- Boss!
Excuse me.
The gimp's making breakfast for you, if you ain't eaten yet.
Jewel.
- Well, where was he hit?
- I don't know.
Trixie shot him.
- Boss!
- Trixie said she killed him?
E.B. Said Trixie killed Hearst!
- You saw him dead?
- No.
- How bad was he hurt?
- I'm not sure.
Well, how bad did Trixie say he was hurt?
If he wasn't hurt, wouldn't I have seen him pursue her?
What you mean is she might not have fucking shot him at all!
Four steps removed.
No fucking closer.
Boss.
- Or w-wouldn't he have?
- Wouldn't he have what?
Shut up, E.B.
- I'm a dead man.
- You ain't gonna be alone.
- I've made this fucking walk before.
- All right.
- Stay here till I get him.
- Then you get out!
Get out with your hovering and fucking clucking!
Before hell breaks fucking loose.
Trixie's here, in back.
Your idea, her coming here?
My fucking idea, after she did what she did.
Was it your idea to have her do that?
All right.
Loopy fucking cunt.
Mother's upstairs.
Get out of the fucking way, Jewel.
- Here, let me take it up.
- No, you fucking won't.
Oh for Christ's sake.
Mr. Utter's come with the child.
Getting another plate.
Mr. Utter said only that Sofia's mother had requested her at The Gem.
Rely that something fucked has transpired... with Mose God knows where, and me likely needed in camp.
- Uh, go ahead, Jane.
- I'll stay with Mrs. Bullock.
Trouble jumps off, ring the bell.
That'll bring me fucking running.
All right.
Or I guess maybe I'll just stay instead.
I suppose there's some connection between his condition and yours.
That bare-breasted woman who shot me seemed to think there ought to be.
Shit!
Go ahead, knowing I'd appreciate less enthusiasm.
Through the years, that fellow's path and mine crossed several times.
I never meant him a moment's harm, but the natural operation of my holdings and his bad luck brought me to figure in his imagination as some sort of bogey.
Mmm.
I expect my attacker was a bawd connected somehow to the man in back before he married so luckily.
Likely, she fell victim as he did to imagining me responsible for the change in her situation.
God damn it!
Often, because our interests are extensive, people like me are believed the authors of events which may benefit our holdings, when our connection in fact is incidental.
God damn it!
Whew, ahh.
I have some calls to make.
Will your gunmen let me pass?
Of course.
Don't you want to dress the wound?
My name is Joseanne.
Mr. Langrishe was so generous to say he would install me today in the theater.
Sit down, dear.
Oh!
We are waiting for him.
One of our chief occupations.
Mr. Farnum!
Ah, good day, sir.
Mr. Farnum, a little while ago
I heard what I took for a gunshot... an impression, I remark, not on the grounds of its uniqueness, but for the shot having seemed to issue from so near to my recumbent ear...
You are not mistaken, sir.
...the hallway, that is to say, separated from where I rested only by a wall whose thinness you've no doubt had others before me deplore.
The walls do thicken in our west wing.
I'll have a quick look for vacancies.
Hearst shot, the wound, alas, not mortal.
"No help," as we say at the tables.
Booth... never went you better.
Anon anon, sir.
Anon anon.
God damn it, Richardson.
You're too ugly to be sneaking up on fucking people.
From Mrs. Marchbanks.
We got all the fucking food we need.
Who the fuck is Mrs. Marchbanks anyway?
It's Aunt Lou.
I guess I'd know her for Mrs. Marchbanks if she took time to introduce herself.
Tell the arrogant nigger thanks.
No hurry returning the basket.
Tell her my fucking name's Miss Caulfield...
I think.
The terms come clear.
If she'd keep her property here, she'll leave, having first hired as many as Hearst has, and who can kill as well as his do and ain't disadvantaged too, to keep Hearst from killing her,
which...
by the shots yesterday and Ellsworth butchered today... means her to understand Hearst will not cease endeavoring to do.
But if she'd herself stay in camp, she must sell her property to him.
A very pithy rendering.
I want to feel his beard.
Mr. Ellsworth's with God now, Sofia.
I want to feel his beard so I can pray that he's saying goodbye to me.
Duck duck duck duck duck.
- Goose.
- Go, James, go!
Go, James, go!
Go, James, go!
Go, James!
Yay!
Aw.
Outflanked by a boy half my size.
Next time I'll get you, James.
Ellsworth's murdered, head-shot at the Garret find.
Your partner's sweetheart put one in Hearst's shoulder.
- Where's Mrs. Ellsworth?
- Above with the child.
- With the child.
- I fucking heard ya.
He once had something to do with her.
Reason for his making the case she sell, keep her here for another swing.
Reason ain't his long suit.
Bullet removed uneventfully.
Let's pray he avoids infection.
What did Hearst say of the shooting?
That some bawd still connected to Ellsworth must have blamed him for the murder.
Wrongheaded and fallen in the bargain.
Would you find pretext to let the mother know I'm here?
- Bullock's with her.
- Shall I shout out and ask it of him?
Very much in your line, this type thing?
Yes.
Not to my taste at all.
Times past, one's fled.
Doc's here.
Someone fell.
Will you excuse me for a moment, darling?
I want to see Mr. Ellsworth.
Excuse me.
Are you certain that she saw her family dead?
Yes.
I certainly assume she did.
The man I once was, Al, was not formidable, and I am but his shadow now.
And yet I'd be put to use.
A decoy, perhaps.
A weight to drop on villains from above.
As I heard the account, the child was found inside a hollowed-out tree trunk some distance from the others.
Having crawled from the carnage and hidden herself,
I'd always assumed.
I suppose, rather than Sofia crawling unseen from the carnage, the possibility might exist that the family hid her in the tree trunk and then fled that distance before the murderers fell upon them.
For the child to have been found having been savaged by wolves, those hours later by strangers, and then taken away having never seen her family again, living or dead...
I can fix that.
Slainte.
Thought you was near pitching a tent and setting up housekeeping over on that first step.
You sound like a pig my cousin run off with.
Get another?
If that cocksucker hadn't shareholders, you could murder him while you adjusted his back.
Serpent's teeth...
shareholders.
10,000 would rise to replace him.
All right, darling.
All right.
Monitor my thinking, Jack.
Oh, no warrant as to competence.
Had Hearst wanted this woman killed, she'd be dead already.
Agree.
The husband's murdered to coerce her to sell.
For the moment, the child's safe too, huh?
Pending the mother's decision... agree.
- Safe then to let 'em go, huh?
- I would, sir.
Yes.
Gonna take Mrs. Ellsworth home.
As you think best.
I wish to thank you again, Mr. Swearengen.
We are all very grateful.
Trixie's with Star at his place.
No one knows but Shaunessey, who lives in fucking terror of me, huh?
Passages between their places only Shaunessey knows.
Heartfelt condolences, madam.
I get to see Mr. Ellsworth tomorrow.
Very good, young lady.
God bless.
You take care of them, Bullock.
Leave the other to me, huh?
Oh, Bullock, you might want to stand guard outside her place.
- I'll take Charlie as backup.
- Hearst ain't gonna be coming for her.
But to bring the matter home as grave, it'd make a case for her selling her claim.
Not to jeopardize the tranquility of your own hearth.
Thank you for looking to them.
Nimbleness, lad, dexterity.
I'd prefer Hearst's advantage at arms.
True true.
The world is less than perfect.
The camp is galvanized.
People scurry about.
They've tasks to perform.
They feel important.
I oughtn't to work in these places.
I was not born to crush my own kind.
Right with you, Wu.
In there.
In there.
First door.
Yeah, in there.
When he leaves, them that ain't lining this fucking hallway like he's the tallest, best-looking white man ever got fucking lucky better prepare for a fucking beating.
Wu...
Custer City... brings back all his Chinks the fuck back to Deadwood.
Wu... back Deadwood?
Brings all his Chinks back, huh?
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood!
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday!
10 day, Swedgin!
I am sorry, Wu.
I'm sorry I made you wait.
But I want you to bring them now.
While you're about your journey,
I'll be trying to conceive some practical use for your countrymen's arrival besides seeming to swell our ranks.
Oh, we'll give 'em guns, yeah.
We'll provide 'em with guns, so any of the slant-eyed bastards know what one is, or, perish the thought, know how to use one... we'll enhance our prospects.
Guns.
Chung Kuo.
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood.
150 Chung Kuo cocksucker, Swedgin.
Shut the fuck up, Wu.
Heng dai.
Heng dai.
Heng dai, fucking Wu.
Big man.
Wu... big man.
Rouse him to spend on pussy, or rob the son of a bitch.
"The Catbird Seat"
Quiet.
I notice too, stupid, we're each of us breathing in and out.
It's Bullock, Star, Utter, and Trixie.
And Harry Manning's outside on a sorrel.
What's the whore doing with 'em?
I don't know.
They ain't fuckin' her.
What the fuck is afoot in that hardware store?
Facing the dawn united, we're even odds for disaster, let alone in fuckin' factions.
Knowing him for an arrant maniac, I'll still not believe Bullock doubts me.
"Certain dangers meet to be faced only by the decent and decorous"
—or idiocy of that fuckin' ilk—is what must have captured his thinking, this fuckin' jerk.
I'm going over there.
I am going the fuck over.
Let them fucking try to exclude me, huh?
You know, saying I like you hefty don't mean you couldn't stand losing a couple of fuckin' pounds.
Whatever you'd have me scrutinize must wait until certain cocksuckers have received a piece of my mind.
Of whom do you speak?
Why are you walking backwards?
The ink's not yet dry, and I'd have your immediate attention to the article at the top right corner.
Stop fuckin' moving then.
Oh, thank you.
How's the fuckin' ribs?
Very painful.
Yeah, right there.
No rooms to let.
Only taking the air.
Well, go away.
I'm at prayer.
If that's not a lie as I situate on the common, what claim has you piety on my deference?
Fuck yourself!
Fuck you, Sir!
Who'd prevent expedition of one's life's disarray.
Telegram from Mr. Swearengen.
A superfluous trumpeting, Mr. Blazanov, as we three are alone.
Do I accomplish my purpose, Al, as to the shooting at Mrs. Ellsworth?
Short of accusation, do I waft the odor of complicity at Hearst's direction...
Give me the telegram.
To settle not only upon his clothing, but as it were, on the man himself, in the very fabric of his being.
This is bullshit!
I'm sorry.
"23 men hired, all on our way."
This squaw-fuckin' idiot—proves in eight words he's incompetent and a fuckin' liar.
He can't have Adams' telegram more than four hours ago, yet he expects me to believe that in four hourshe can prudently assess the qualities of 23 hires.
And you know what "on our way" means, huh?
No.
"On our way" means they're getting drunk and blown in some saloon in Cheyenne and running their mouths about this big fuckin' filibustering expedition they're being commissioned for under the command of the famous Hawkeye
—the laziest, most shit-faced whore-mongering cocksucker to ever piss my money away!
Please do not strike me.
Have you finished the article, Al?
That I have not wiped his expectoration from my cheek is understandable.
I'm threatened with death if I do.
That I stand immobile these hours later speaks of a flaw in my will.
Surely this is not the culminating indignity.
There remains, for example, receiving his regurgitations or swallowing his feces!
Would I stand stoic...still?
I am going to fuck you up.
I'm going to fuck you up.
And I'm the kind of cunt you'll let close.
Quit it, Richardson.
Is it all right then, the article?
Perfect.
Fuckin' wafts just the way you want it to.
I'll go ahead and publish then.
I gotta get to the fuckin' hardware store!
Jack.
Young man?
At the soul's dark hour?
Name one that fuckin' ain't.
Mr. Langrishe.
Yes.
We're going in there, E.B. Shall I join you, as we all seem up and about?
Excuse me...
Gentlemen.
Waiting for the Sheriff.
We campaign in Sturgis.
A meeting, I gather, of the upper fucking crust exclusively.
No hoi polloi need apply.
I ought to have called you.
What events in the camp would argue I be called back from Sturgis is what we are trying to decide.
It's not a meeting at all, per se.
Now I don't feel so horribly injured.
The meeting per se is what he'll not be kept from.
Jack Langrishe.
He's all right.
You showed perfect judgment, Sir.
I'd keep from the camp that your janissaries have arrived.
We'll quarter at your find.
Will you drink?
No, thanks you.
I will.
Shall we leave it being generally vigilant?
Under very specific circumstances we'll wire you to make early return.
Yes.
That's exactly it.
And those would be?
Any further shooting out of the ordinary.
Like at Mrs. Ellsworth, definitely.
Hearst-initiated horseshit of any sort.
Intimidation or the like.
If it looks to eventuate in immediate violence.
Otherwise why try even to make it to Sturgis for the speeches?
Hearst-initiated bullshit is inevitable is his point.
Surely, Sir, you leave in the certain knowledge that you are the camp's irreplaceable man.
He don't need no further encouragement in that way of thinking.
Comes to sending a wire, I put that Russian ill at ease.
Oh, I do all right with him.
My meetings—I provide refreshments.
You were shown the tent of the man I want killed first.
Looked fine, how he wants to work it.
I'm leaving.
Come in.
It's too much.
He's too cruel.
Come in.
Brazenly sends the other packing, to brazenly install her replacement in the theater.
How was he brazen with the one who left?
No one with eyes could fail to recognize their connection.
And now brazenly— Us recognizing his connection to the one who left does not mean he was brazen.
Fine.
Fine then.
I just came to say goodbye.
Must I agree he is brazen for you to not leave the troupe?
He has no respect for art.
Claudia.
He hates me.
No.
I was well-received in Denver.
Yeah, very well received.
I could have stayed.
I could have let you all go on.
I think you were approached by Millerick.
I was.
Go to sleep, Claudia.
No coaches now anyhow.
Did he suspect Millerick approached me?
He doesn't miss much.
He misses everything.
I juggled at amateur night.
And what are you doing now?
Praying for my loved ones.
How nice.
Lucky them.
Would my conversating with her or lingering after supper have disrupted the little one's routine on a day that had been disrupted previous?
Yes.
Already she'd seen a series of people taking up watch to protect that schoolhouse, and how many questions must have occurred to her
—because that is a bright child—"What is transpiring that we need guarding from?"
And what memories must that have brought back of her own dear family murdered in a sudden fake Indian depredation by shit-heel fuckin' road agents.
Not solely how would I like to be passing the evening, the like.
When I've left, have I given the mother more calming down to do before she gets the child asleep?
Them's the sort of things is what you have to consider.
Fuck, must you hover, fucking Merrick?
I admit to wondering, Al, if you have any further impression of my article.
Didn't I tell you how well it wafted?
If on second reading— Merrick, it's a good article.
It'll no doubt irritate him, fucking Hearst, but I'm wakeful wondering who he's likely to shoot at next, so with regard to that I've gave your article all the thought I need to.
Who do you think he might shoot at?
I have no fucking idea, Merrick.
I doubt it'll be long before we find out, and in the fucking interval until we do,
I guess I'll just have to abandon any prospect of finding respite in any part of your rag I could just fucking read without having to evaluate how it fucking wafts!
Oh, which leaves me the solace of contemplating the journeying hither of the intrepid fucking Hawkeye and his 23 fucking reprobates to even the odds in the coming combat.
Didn't tell you that, did I, Adams?
Hawkeye's wire to announce he's on his way.
Does that sound likely to you or does it confirm our deepest doubts about his incompetence and veracity?
And mine, in turn, about you that I allowed to fucking vouch for him!
Couldn't let him read his fucking paper.
26...27...28.
Uh, not counting them soldiers or Yankton's commissioner.
I won't be lingering once we've finished.
If you want to stay and politic, you'll have to ride back alone.
I hate what happened in your home.
It's all right.
Your wife good enough to ask me in for breakfast.
I'm working on my presentation.
That lovely woman putting her hand behind her for support when I feared she might fall to the floor.
Would you shut up about it?
And then, even if only briefly, to have failed to acknowledge it had been my wind, I'd—
What's your purpose here?
What do you mean?
There's no Sioux around here.
Shall I go find some, ask 'em to join us?
I'm saying there's no Fort and there's no Sioux.
Why would they have you bivouacked?
Seems like you got me confused for a general.
Don't be grazing by the windows.
Come in and listen or stay the fuck out of sight.
I guess you got yourself mistaken for a general.
He wants to know what we're here for.
We're here for the election, maybe gonna exercise the franchise.
Time for us to speak now, Sheriff.
Have they told you yet who you're voting for?
Not yet.
Sheriff, we— Shut up, Harry.
Mr. Utter!
Mr.—
The key got stuck.
Ready for fucking Freddie?
Hearst let his dogs loose.
Davey, get to the Russian.
Tell him to wire Sturgis.
Say to wire Bullock as agreed, huh?
I want my child.
I'll—I'll go get her now.
Mr. Ellsworth—Mr. Ellsworth's been shot.
Mr. Ellsworth's been killed.
I want my child!
She'll be here with you before you know it, Mrs. Ellsworth.
Oh, what did I do to him?
We'll go upstairs, get you a drink.
What did I do to that poor man?
You didn't fucking shoot him.
And don't be going off into fucking hysterics, huh?
Collect your child.
Utter will be back with her here any minute.
Come on.
I'm going to make her breakfast.
Pinchbeck motherfucker.
My goodness!
Bare-breasted.
My word.
Who has commissioned such behavior?
Who summons you with such power to do his will?
Mr. Hearst?
Mr. Hearst?
Did someone interrupt your rendez-vous?
Did someone else attack him?
Cover those things.
Give me your fucking poot-butt gun.
Why?
Fucking shoot me with it if you don't.
What's going on, Trixie?
Ellsworth's murdered, and I fucking shot Hearst, and I don't think I killed him!
Shoot me or he'll do for all of us.
Shoot me!
Shoot me!
Don't you fucking take me anywhere!
Shut up!
Stand the fuck up!
I piss hard-stole money away to gussy you fucking cunts up.
Starchy bullshit.
And fucking pretend there's a difference between fat ass snatch and fat ass snatch in a fucking petticoat!
Come on, Mr. T.
Where are we going, you rummy-faced piece of shit?
!
I'm just saying—
Just saying what?
What were you just saying?
I don't know, Sir.
Weren't you being this fat twat's gallant?
Ain't Con the nuts, fatso?
Ain't it great to have a fucking beau?
I'm Seth Bullock.
In Montana, I had a hardware bidness with my partner Sol Star, and we do the same in Deadwood, which we came to in '76.
I was Marshal and territorial delegate in Montana, and I'm Health Commissioner and Sheriff where we are now.
With the hills now part of the new territory, I run for Sheriff of the new organized county.
If elected, my intention's to look to the good and safety of people hereabouts.
I will venture my life that law-abiding persons will be secure in their rights and their property.
I have to go.
What is it, Bullock?
What happened?
Don't you know?
Have they just got you handling the votes?
The voting exclusively.
He's dead.
Dead!
And at my hands!
Or the next thing to it.
Who?
Hearst!
He's dead?
I think.
Boss!
Excuse me.
The gimp's making breakfast for you, if you ain't ate yet.
Jewel.
Well, where was he hit?
I don't know.
Trixie shot him.
Boss!
Trixie said she killed him?
E.B. said Trixie killed Hearst!
You saw him dead?
No.
How bad was he hurt?
I'm not sure.
Well, how bad did Trixie say he was hurt?
If he wasn't hurt, wouldn't I have seen him pursue her?
What you mean is she might not have fucking shot him at all!
Four steps removed no fucking closer.
Boss.
Or w-wouldn't he have?
Wouldn't he have what?
Shut up, E.B.
I'm a dead man.
You ain't gonna be alone.
I've made this fucking walk before.
All right.
Stay here till I get him.
Then you get out!
Get out with your hovering and fucking clucking!
Before hell breaks fucking loose.
Trixie's here, in back.
Your idea, her coming here?
My fucking idea, after she did what she did.
Was it your idea to have her do that?
All right.
Loopy fucking cunt.

I oughtn't to work in these places.
I was not born to crush my own kind.
Right with you, Wu.
In there.
In there.
First door.
Yeah, in there.
When he leaves, them that ain't lining this fucking hallway like he's the tallest, best-looking white man ever got fucking lucky,
better prepare for a fucking beating.
Wu—Custer City—brings back all his Chinks the fuck back to Deadwood.
Wu...back Deadwood?
Brings all his Chinks back, huh?
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood!
Ding n amah gai.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday!
10 day, Swedgin!
I am sorry, Wu.
I'm sorry I made you wait.
But I want you to bring them now.
While you're about your journey,
I'll be trying to conceive some practical use for your countrymen's arrival besides seeming to swell our ranks.
Oh, we'll give 'em guns, yeah.
We'll provide 'em with guns, so any of the slant-eyed bastards know what one is, or, perish the thought, know how to use one— we'll enhance our prospects.
Guns.
Chung Kuo.
Wu, Custer City, back Deadwood.
150 Chunk Kuo cocksucker, Swedgin.
Shut the fuck up, Wu.

Big man.
Wu—big man.
Rouse him to spend on pussy, or rob the son of a bitch.

Oh, Brian, we're so thrilled your gay cousin, Jasper, finally decided to come visit.
Me, too.
It's been way too long.
Anyway, thanks for putting him up.
No problem, Brian.
It's great to have visitors.
Except for that time Moby-Dick stayed with us.
Do you have any Raisin Bran?
Uh, oh, no, sorry.
Well, can you go get me some?
Uh, boy, that's kind of a pain in the...
We do have...
We got Total, and we got some raisins.
I mean, you could, like, mix those together.
I mean, it would be kind of like Raisin Bran.
Mmm, yeah, but it's not.
It would be like Raisin Bran, but it's not Raisin Bran.
That would be like Total with raisins in it.
That's just splitting hairs here.
It's not really doing it for me.
What time did you say your flight was?
Oh, no locks.
Thank you, Homeland Security.
Hey, bud, take a break.
I'll take over.
Go smoke a fatty.
Thanks.
This is Sierra Tango 817,
Matthew McConaughey's private jet, requesting permission to land.
Matthew McConaughey?
Oh, sorry, Sierra Tango 817.
All our runways are filled.
But it looks empty from up here.
We're almost out of fuel.
No, no.
No room at all.
But, lucky for you, there's a big, new airport out in the middle of the ocean.
Keep going.
You can't miss it.
Roger that.
Oops.
Well, look at it this way.
I just got you on next year's Oscar telecast.
You'll be right after Ron Howard!
Just messing with you, Ron.
Or maybe not!
No, seriously, I am.
Or am I?
No.
Oh, there's Jasper's plane.
- Where?
- Third one in line.
Oh, it's one of them new niche airlines.
Hey, Cousin!
Hey, Jasper!
Everybody, this is Ricardo, from the Philippines and my kitchen floor.
How was your flight?
Oh, torture!
Five hours on my moneymaker, sitting across from a gaggle of sailors flying home on leave.
Here I am in a committed relationship, and all I can think about is having a piece of Navy cake.
"Hello.
Who's that on the phone?" "Temptation!"
How does he always get my number?
I don't know.
Anyway, I got big news, and I'll tell you over dinner.
Greek.
On me.
But enough about last weekend.
I'm terrible!
This idiot will fit in with our family as badly as Peter fit in with The Proclaimers.
I'm singing!
I'm singing!
Hey, Chris, this field trip is your chance, man.
Alyssa is all alone.
She's so pretty that if your Hacky Sack were my private parts,
I'd let her do that to them.
What?
Kick them around?
Um, wait.
Yes.
Welcome, citizens.
Today we commemorate those brave Quahog soldiers who perished in the recent Gulf conflict.
I can think of no greater tribute to their memories than this solid gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks frog.
What is that?
The spirit of America is epitomized by his inspiring motto,
'"Smack, smack, Sugar Smack.
'"Give me a smack, and I'll smack you back. '"
I'd also like to take this opportunity to announce extreme budget cutbacks having almost nothing to do with this solid gold statue.
Have you ever seen such a waste of the taxpayers' money?
You're talking to me!
This is more exciting than that time me and my friends did mushrooms.
This is gonna be awesome!
You said it.
Man, you guys feel anything yet?
I feel kind of funny.
I got a bellyache.
We shouldn't have did this, man.
Lois, darling, those earrings are delicious.
Total kitsch.
Like an Andy Warhol wet dream.
I'm opening a museum and putting you in it, they're that fabulous.
You think it's clever talking like that, do you?
You think it's funny?
Talking about earrings, and using words like "fabulous" and "delicious" and "wet. "
What's next?
A workout followed by a romp around a crowded room while the music goes...
Oh, why did you stop?
Hey, Jasper, let me ask you something.
When you're in the shower at the "Y,"
is that just like Supermarket Sweep for you guys, or is there some kind of etiquette?
Peter, stop it.
God!
You're more clueless than Popeye.
Sir, I think you should know these growths on your forearms, they're giant tumors.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, I'm surprised you haven't realized this is not how a human being is supposed to look.
And the speech thing, and what you're doing with your eye...
Uh, you had a stroke about seven years ago.
That you've managed to be walking around all this time is nothing short of a miracle.
I'd say about two months.
Okay, all right, time for the big announcement.
Everyone, Ricardo and I are getting married!
Oh, that is terrific!
It's about time you two settled down.
Oh, you hear that, Meg?
Guys can marry other guys now.
So...
This is awkward, but, uh,
I mean, if they can do that, that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?
I mean, you might as well pack it in.
Game over.
Alyssa, hi.
I was wondering if maybe you wanted to do something sometime?
Sure, Chris.
I have a Young Republicans meeting after school.
You wanna come?
Oh, sure.
What do you do at a Young Republicans meeting?
We help those who already have the means to help themselves.
Also, we perpetuate the ideal that Jesus chose America to destroy nonbelievers and brown people.
I don't understand what you're saying, but somehow I feel safer.
Karl, this is Chris.
He wants to join our club.
Karl is our chancellor.
Well, Chris, we'd be happy to have you.
There's just one little rite of initiation.
Liberal chubby chaser!
Well, if you can't laugh at yourself...
I'm here at the parking lot outside city hall, where hundreds of citizens have come out in protest of the Mayor's decision to spend the town's treasury on a gold frog.
I don't like it.
And I don't like the contraction apostrophe-E-M.
As far as I'm concerned, his name is Dig Them.
You're not welcome here, Dig Them.
I stand behind my decision.
This press conference is over.
I can't see you now.
I can't hear you now.
You're not here now.
Well, there you have it.
Back to you, Tom.
Thanks, Tom.
Some damn fine reporting.
Damn fine.
Diane?
Well, it's encouraging to know that I'm not the only Mayor West who's facing difficulties.
But what I need now is a diversion.
Let's see.
Mmm. "Jingle keys. "
My God!
I'm a tomato!
And now back to The Sound of Music.
Oh, thank heaven.
The von Trapp family escaped!
Reverend Mother, I have sinned.
What is this sin, my child?
Oh, well.
No harm done.
I too have sinned, Mother.
Oh, my God!
That's Rolfe!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Hey, I didn't start this war, but it's on!
Oh, Lois, there you are.
Listen, Ricardo and I wanna thank you for letting us have the wedding here.
Oh!
You're having the wedding here?
Yeah.
I hope that's okay, Lois.
I offered them the house.
Oh, uh, sure.
No problem.
Hey, McButt the Crime Dog,
I heard you and your little chew toy getting it on last night.
Keep it down.
Sorry, little man.
Ricardo and I were playing Clue, and he got me in the bedroom with a lead pipe.
Peter, I'm not sure I'm comfortable having this wedding at the house.
Lois, I don't know what the big deal is.
So they're gay.
It's not like we're gonna have a gay sex orgy in the living room.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I've got nothing against homosexuals.
I mean, I'll watch anything with David Schwimmer.
But the idea of two men actually getting married, it just doesn't seem right.
Hey, I say who cares, you know?
If gays wanna get married and be miserable like the rest of us,
I say we should let them.
Oh, no!
- What's wrong?
- Look.
Some breaking news today when Mayor West announced he will sign a citywide ban on gay marriages next week.
While controversial, it has nonetheless effectively distracted all of us from the Dig 'Em fiasco.
- The what?
- I don't know.
Something about a lizard.
And now this.
Look at that.
In the '30s, they called this an Uncle Spinny Dervish.
- Really?
- I don't know.
I'm just bored.
A ban on gay marriage?
Oh, my God!
Matthew McConaughey?
Yeah, I'm looking for a guy named Stewie.
Chris, grab his legs.
I gotta bury this thing.
- But I...
- Grab his legs!
I can't believe the wedding's off.
All I ever wanted was to get married and make a home with a skinny, hairless Filipino boy.
Isn't that the American dream?
Oh, don't give up yet, Jasper.
Mayor West only banned gay marriage so he could distract from the Dig 'Em scandal.
He won't get away with it.
Oh, Jasper, where'd you get these brownies?
They're from a bakery in the West Quahog gay district.
I thought they'd help my depression.
Oh, I can see why.
Oh, my God, they pack so much fudge into these.
And look at this.
There's even a couple of nuts lodged in there.
I'm going upstairs.
Oh, I've got to do something.
Jasper's always been there for me when I've needed him.
I am gonna make Mayor West change his mind.
But, Brian, the Bible says gay marriage is an abomination.
Oh, don't give me that Young Republican crap, Chris.
The Bible also says a senior citizen built an ark and rounded up two of every animal.
- Hey.
- Yeah?
What the hell is this?
Oh, you didn't really give any specific guidelines about mating.
- Did you name it?
- What?
Did you name it?
Uh, yeah, he's Paul.
Yeah?
Well, it's gonna be a hell of a lot harder for you now, because he's going the fuck overboard.
Hi, Glenn.
Uh, hey, will you sign a petition to overturn
Mayor West's ban on gay marriage?
Gay marriage?
Oh, come on, two halves can't make a whole without a hole.
Giggity Giggity Giggity Giggity.
You get off my property, you pervert.
Uh, Mr. Bottomtooth, would you like to sign the petition?
Uh, I don't...
What's the problem?
Ah!
Okay.
Thank you.
Chris, did you hear?
Some dog is going around town trying to get support for gay marriage.
Oh, that's Brian.
He's got a petition.
Really?
Chris, you've got to destroy that petition.
Why?
Because if you do, I'll let you touch my boobs.
Is that good?
Do I want that?
Oh, yeah, you want that.
Well, fantastic then.
How can I help you, Mrs. Griffin?
Well, I'm having a bit of a crisis.
I'm a very open-minded person, and I've never had any problem with gays before, but something about two gay people getting married,
I just don't think it's right.
Well, these questions are too big to be decided by human beings.
Which is why God made this film.
You know, there's been a lot of talk lately about homosexuals, but how do you know what to believe?
Well, here are a few tips that may help you tell when you've got a gay.
So, uh, what's your favorite Madonna album?
I like her early work.
If his answer is anything but '"I've never bought one, '"
you've got a gay.
Let's take a blood sample, Mr. Braga.
If instead of human blood, you find a deadly corrosive acid, you've got a gay.
Not this time, nancy-boy.
Well, that was interesting.
I also have My Giant with Billy Crystal.
Oh, God, no, no.
Well, we almost have enough signatures, thanks to Quahog's gay district.
Lois, how'd you like to be signature number 10,000?
- Brian, I can't sign this.
- Why not?
Well, because I don't believe in gay marriage.
You don't believe...
Lois, that's ridiculous.
Gay people have every right to get married.
Well, they certainly have every right to be together, but marriage should be between a man and a woman.
Well, that's not how they do it in West Quahog.
By the way, Lois, I got a piercing over there.
I'm not gonna tell you where, but I'll give you a hint.
It wasn't my nose or my ear and it was one of my balls.
Well, regardless of what you think, this is going to change Mayor West's mind, and we are gonna have Jasper's wedding here.
Fine.
Then until this is all over, I'll stay somewhere else.
Come on, Stewie, we're going to Grandma and Grandpa's.
Fine, I'll go, but I'm not missing that gay wedding.
I still kick myself for missing that topless cheerleader parade with the 100-foot chocolate teddy bear and the F-16s doing aerial acrobatics, choreographed to the music of Queen.
Oh, I remember that day.
Huh.
Should have gone to that thing.
My petition!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm going to get to touch right-wing boob because of this.
You idiot!
Now I'm going to have to get 10,000 more signatures before tomorrow morning.
What were you thinking?
You don't understand, Brian.
When was the last time you were even with a woman?
- Uh, when did the Challenger blow up?
- '86.
Yeah, it was like three years before that.
Mayor West, here's the gay marriage ban for your approval.
Excellent.
This is so important,
I'm going to sign it with all capital letters.
It's going to say, "ADAM WEST."
That's what it's going to say, you'll see.
Hey, buddy, you can't go in there.
Mayor West, you have to look at this.
Ten thousand signatures.
I've been up for 24 hours,
I paid off a few people and I did a few things in West Quahog I'm not proud of.
So, it's a show about three hookers and their mom?
This is very impressive, but my decision stands.
No!
Come on, buddy, you're leaving.
No, I can't let Jasper down.
I'm not going to let you sign that.
Go on, get out of here.
I should warn you, I have a tiny bullet-proof shield, the exact size of a bullet, somewhere on my body.
And if you hit it, I'll be unharmed, and your plan will be foiled.
You'll be the laughingstock of me.
I don't want to shoot you, Mayor West.
Good, because I'm incredibly crafty.
Hey, what's that on the ceiling?
Now I'm over here.
Look, this has gotten out of hand, I know.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.
But you can put an end to this right now by tearing up that gay marriage ban.
You won't break me.
15 years ago I swallowed everything I needed to escape from a hostage situation.
A wall!
Well, no matter.
I'm prepared for a lengthy captivity as well.
I swallowed this People magazine in 1989.
All right, Paul Hogan, tell me about the real Crocodile Dundee.
It's so nice to have you home, dear.
I can take it or leave it.
God, this is such an old-people house, you know.
I mean, look at this candy jar.
Let's, uh, take a look in here.
Let's see what you got here.
You got...
You got licorice.
Oh, that's, uh, that's...
Oh, Freedent.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah, I got a sweet tooth,
I think I'll have some Freedent.
What's this?
A cough drop.
A Luden's cough drop.
Is that candy?
No, I don't think that's candy.
I think it's a cough drop!
What else we got?
Look.
Look at this.
There's a fishing lure in here.
There's a fishing lure in the candy jar.
What?
Am I supposed to eat this?
Eat a fishing lure?
Hey, look, Brian's on TV.
And now, some Channel five exclusive footage of the crazed homosexual gunman who's taken Mayor West hostage.
Oh, my God!
Brian's taken the Mayor hostage?
Is this an eyeglass lens?
I didn't realize how strongly he feels about this.
Gay marriage.
Next thing you know, they'll want to vote.
Oh, oh, look at this.
A spare key for a Volkswagen Scirocco.
They don't even make this anymore.
They don't even make this car anymore.
Whose key could this possibly be?
What if Brian's right?
I mean, certainly the love between a man and a woman should be sacred, but...
Who's talking about love?
We're talking about marriage.
Well, don't you love Mom?
Come on, Lois, look at her.
So two straight people who hate each other have more of a right to be together than two gay people who love each other?
That's what we raised you to believe.
Oh, my God!
I've made a terrible mistake!
I've been brainwashed, like Elizabeth Smart.
It's so wonderful having her home again.
She's brought music back into the house.
Playing songs on the harp.
Of course most of them are about rape, but it's still nice.
I think I made Brian crazy.
Maybe I shouldn't have burned that petition.
No, Chris, you did the right thing.
It's only a matter of time before Mayor West signs that bill, and you'll get to touch these.
Oh, boy, I got a feeling that before the end of the day,
I'm going to be burying my dog.
Whoa, whoa.
I said you could touch my boobs.
Let's start with that.
Look, Peter, if you can't get Brian to come out peacefully, we're going to have to take him down.
Don't worry, Joe, I'm good with tight situations.
Like when I saved Luke Skywalker's life.
Okay, Luke, this will keep you warm until I get the shelter built.
You're sure this is okay?
Yeah, you're just cutting into the fat.
All right, Brian, Peter's coming in.
I'll relax him by using my catchphrase.
Hey, what's up with you?
- What the hell was that?
- My catchphrase.
You don't have a catchphrase.
Why you gotta say like that?
Excuse me.
Would anyone like to play Stratego?
I have Stratego.
Oh, Peter, I never meant for this to happen.
This whole situation has totally spiraled out of control.
Brian, listen to me.
I was wrong.
If two people love each other, they should have the right to get married.
But you have to come down and give yourself up.
If you drag this out any longer, you're only hurting your own cause.
She's right.
I'm sorry, Mayor West.
Well, you were only doing what you thought was right, Brian.
And, hey, you've distracted everyone from the Dig 'Em statue, so I guess we don't need this bill anymore.
Everybody happy!
Well, it sure was nice of Mayor West to drop the kidnapping charges.
It's amazing.
All he asked for in return was the key to a Volkswagen Scirocco.
You're welcome.
Listen, Lois,
I really appreciate you putting your discomfort aside, so we could have the wedding here.
Oh, please, I'm over all that now.
Two men getting married doesn't bother me in the least.
They deserve happiness.
Everybody gay!

Peter, I'm not sure I'm comfortable having this wedding at the house.
Lois, I don't know what the big deal is.
So they're gay.
It's not like we're gonna have a gay sex orgy in the living room.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I've got nothing against homosexuals.
I mean,
I'll watch anything with David Schwimmer.
But the idea of two men actually getting married.
It just doesn't seem right.
Hey, I say who cares, you know?
If gays wanna get married and be miserable like the rest of us, I say we should let 'em.
Oh, no!
- What's wrong?
- Look.
Some breaking news today when Mayor West announced he will sign a citywide ban on gay marriages next week.
While controversial, it has nonetheless effectively distracted all of us from the Dig 'Em fiasco.
- The what?
- I don't know.
Something about a lizard.
And now this.
Look at that.
In the '30s, they called this an Uncle Spinny Dervish.
- Really?
- I don't know.
I'm just bored.
A ban on gay marriage?
!
Oh, my God!
Matthew McConaughey?
Yeah.
I'm looking for a guy named Stewie.
Chris, grab his legs.
I gotta bury this thing.
- But I.
- Grab his legs!
I can't believe the wedding's off.
All I ever wanted was to get married and make a home with a skinny, hairless Filipino boy.
Isn't that the American dream?
Don't give up yet, Jasper.
Mayor West only banned gay marriage so he could distract from the Dig 'Em scandal.
He won't get away with it.
Ah, Jasper, where'd you get these brownies?
They're from a bakery in the West Quahog gay district.
I thought they'd help my depression.
Oh, I can see why.
Oh, my God, they pack so much fudge into these.
And look at this, there's even a couple of nuts lodged in there.
I'm going upstairs.
I've got to do something.
Jasper's always been there for me when I've needed him.
I am going to make Mayor West change his mind.
But, Brian, the Bible says gay marriage is an abomination.
Oh, don't give me that Young Republican crap, Chris.
The Bible also says a senior citizen built an ark and rounded up two of every animal.
What the hell is this?
you didn't really give any specific guidelines about mating.
- Did you name it?
- What?
- Did you name it?
- Uh, yeah, he's Paul.
Yeah, it's going to be a hell of a lot harder for you now, 'cause he's going the **** overboard.
Hi, Glenn.
Hey, will you sign a petition to overturn Mayor West's ban on gay marriage?
Gay marriage?
Oh, come on, two halves can't make a whole without a hole.
You get off my property, you pervert.
Uh, Mr. Bottomtooth, would you like to sign the petition?
Uh, I don't... wha-wha-what's the problem?
Uh, okay.
Thank you.
Chris, did you hear?
Some dog is going around town trying to get support for gay marriage.
Oh, that's Brian.
He's got a petition.
Really?
Chris, you've got to destroy that petition.
Why?
Because if you do, I'll let you touch my boobs.
Is... is that good?
- Do I want that?
- Oh, yeah, you want that.
Well, fantastic then.
How can I help you, Mrs. Griffin?
Well, I'm having a bit of a crisis.
I'm a very open-minded person, and I've never had any problem with gays before, but something about two gay people getting married, I just don't think it's right.
Well, these questions are too big to be decided by human beings.
Which is why God made this film.
You know, there's been a lot of talk lately about homosexuals, but how do you know what to believe?
Well, here are a few tips that may help you tell when you've got a gay.
So what's your favorite Madonna album?
I like her early work.
If his answer is anything but
"I've never bought one,"
you've got a gay.
Let's take a blood sample, Mr. Braga.
If instead of human blood, you find a deadly corrosive acid, you've got a gay.
Not this time, Nancy boy.
Wow, that was interesting.
I also have My Giant with Billy Crystal.
Oh, God, no, no.
Well, we almost have enough signatures, thanks to Ouahog's gay district.
Lois, how'd you like to be signature number 10,000?
Brian, I can't sign this.
Why not?
Well, because I don't believe in gay marriage.
You don't believe...?
Lois, that's ridiculous.
Gay people have every right to get married.
Well, they certainly have every right to be together, but marriage should be between a man and a woman.
Well, that's not how they do it in West Quahog.
By the way, Lois, I got a piercing over there.
I'm not going to tell you where, but I'll give you a hint.
It wasn't my nose or my ear and it was one of my balls.
Well, regardless of what you think, this is going to change Mayor West's mind, and we are going to have Jasper's wedding here.
Fine.
Then until this is all over, I'll stay somewhere else.
Come on, Stewie, we're going to Grandma and Grandpa's.
Fine I'll go, but I'm not missing that gay wedding.
I still kick myself for missing that Topless Cheerleader Parade with the hundred-foot chocolate teddy bear and the F-16s doing aerial acrobatics choreographed to the music of Queen.
Oh, I remember that day.
Should have gone to that thing.
My petition!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm going to get to touch right-wing boob because of this.
You idiot!
Now I'm going to have to get 10,000 more signatures before tomorrow morning.
What were you thinking?
!
You don't understand, Brian.
When was the last time you were even with a woman?
Uh... when did the Challenger blow up?
'86.
Yeah, it was like three years before that.
Mayor West, here's the gay marriage ban for your approval.
Excellent.
This is so important,
I'm going to sign it with all capital letters. it's going to say,
"ADAM WEST."
That's what it's going to say, you'll see.
Hey, buddy, you can't go in there.
Mayor West, you have to look at this.
10,000 signatures.
I've been up for 24 hours, I paid off a few people and I did a few things in West Quahog I'm not proud of.
So, it's a show about three hookers and their mom?
This is very impressive, but my decision stands.
No!
Come on, buddy, you're leaving.
No, I can't let Jasper down.
I'm not going to let you sign that.
Go on, get out of here.
I should warn you,
I have a tiny bullet-proof shield the exact size of a bullet somewhere on my body.
And if you hit it,
I'll be unharmed and your plan will be foiled.
You'll be the laughingstock of me.
I don't want to shoot you, Mayor West.
Good, because I'm incredibly crafty.
Hey, what's that on the ceiling?
Now I'm over here.
Look, this has gotten out of hand, I know.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.
You can put an end to this right now by tearing up that gay marriage ban.
You won't break me.
15 years ago I swallowed everything I needed to escape from a hostage situation.
A wall!
Well, no matter.
I'm prepared for a lengthy captivity as well.
I swallowed this People magazine in 1989.
All right, Paul Hogan, tell me about the real Crocodile Dundee.
It's so nice to have you home, dear.
I can take it or leave it.
God, this is such an old people house, you know.
I mean, look at this candy jar.
Let's take a look in here.
Let's see what you got here.
You got, uh...
Oh, you got licorice.
Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh...
Oh, Freedent.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah, yeah, I got a sweet tooth, I think I'll have some Freedent.
Oh, what's this?
Oh, a cough drop.
A Luden's cough drop.
Is that candy?
No, I don't think that's candy.
I think it's a cough drop!
Uh, what else we got?
Oh, look, look at this.
There's a fishing lure in here.
There's a fishing lure in the candy jar.
What, am I supposed to eat this?
Eat a fishing lure?
Hey, look, Brian's on TV.
And now, some Channel 5 exclusive footage of the crazed homosexual gunman who's taken Mayor West hostage.
Oh, my God!
Brian's taken the Mayor hostage?
!
Is this an eyeglass lens?
I didn't realize how strongly he feels about this.
Gay marriage.
Next thing you know, they'll want to vote.
Oh, oh, look at this.
A spare key for a Volkswagen Scirocco.
They don't even make this anymore.
They don't even make this car anymore.
Whose key could this possibly be?
What if Brian's right?
I mean, certainly the love between a man and a woman should be sacred, but...
Who's talking about love?
We're talking about marriage.
Well, don't you love Mom?
Come on, Lois, look at her.
So two straight people who hate each other have more of a right to be together than two gay people who love each other?
That's what we raised you to believe.
Oh, my God!
I've made a terrible mistake!
I've been brainwashed like Elizabeth Smart.
It's so wonderful having her home again.
She's brought music back into the house.
Playing songs on the harp.
Of course, most of them are about rape, but it's still nice.
I think I made Brian crazy.
Maybe I shouldn't have burned that petition.
Oh, no, Chris, you did the right thing.
It's only a matter of time before Mayor West signs that bill, and you'll get to touch these.
Oh, boy, I got a feeling that before the end of the day,
I'm going to be burying my dog.
Whoa, whoa, I said you could touch my boobs.
Let's start with that.
Look, Peter, if you can't get Brian to come out peacefully, we're going to have to take him down.
Don't worry, Joe, I'm good with tight situations.
Like when I saved Luke Skywalker's life.
Okay, Luke, this will keep you warm until I get the shelter built.
- You sure this is okay?
- Yeah, you're just cutting into the fat.
All right, Brian, Peter's coming in.
I'll relax him by using my catchphrase.
Hey, whassa happa witchu?
- What the hell was that?
- My catchphrase.
You don't have a catchphrase.
Why you gotta sayya like a-dat?
Excuse me.
Would anyone like to play Stratego?
I have Stratego.
Peter, I never meant for this to happen.
This whole situation is totally spiraled out of control.
Brian, listen to me.
I was wrong.
If two people love each other, they should have the right to get married.
But you have to come down and give yourself up.
If you drag this out any longer, you're only hurting your own cause.
She's right.
I'm sorry, Mayor West.
Well, you were only doing what you thought was right, Brian.
And, hey, you've distracted everyone from the Dig 'Em statue, so I guess we don't need this bill anymore.
Evera-bodah ha-ppy!
Well, it sure was nice of Mayor West to drop the kidnapping charges.
Amazing.
All he asked for in return was the key to a Volkswagen Scirocco.
You're welcome.
Listen, Lois, I...
I really appreciate you putting your discomfort aside, so we can have the wedding here.
Please, I'm over all that now.
Two men getting married doesn't bother me in the least.
They deserve happiness.
Everybody gay!

Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.
You have to really stay.
You must betray Roslin and run for President in the upcoming election.
I know it's hard, but it's the only way.
Word of Fisk's murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
A crew can fall apart when their commander's killed.
Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
I'm putting Garner in command.
But he's an engineer, not a command officer.
He's the best they got.
Pegasus, Buster.
Dradis intercept training birds are away.
Buster, Pegasus.
Roger that.
Take station as briefed.
Be advised communications will suffer sporadic interruptions clue to stellar EMI activity, acknowledge.
Pegasus, Buster.
Acknowledge.
Our communications suck.
It's gonna be like this all day?
Big time.
Those binaries are putting out so much EMI, even the dradis is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna put a little distance between us and the fleet.
Get us out of this soup, see if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Hey!
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go!
Come on!
Got a couple of tired Viper jockeys out here who want to sleep.
Go hit the showers, Duck.
We'll be gone by the time you get back.
How you feel?
Oh, not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up, and it's been almost a month, so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly of The Beast?
The Beast?
Yeah.
That's what they call the Pegasus now.
Galactica's The Bucket.
The Bucket and The Beast.
Huh.
Don't we make a pair?
Come on.
No, you come on.
Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you?
One word, Starbuck.
Is she in hack again?
Not yet.
But apparently she's been driving Commander Garner up one bulkhead and down the other ever since she took over flight training on, what did you call it?
The Beast.
And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I...
Oh.
Were you gonna mention these?
Oh, yeah.
I got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy.
Doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Oh, well, if you say so, then it must be true.
So what's going on?
We were unloading one of the containers and then one of the crates shifted.
So we looked inside and we saw that something was moving.
Did you call it in?
Yeah.
We shut the door and the Marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait?
Just wait out here.
Chief?
Is this the Galactica?
Yeah.
Are you Doctor Cottle?
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
We should call it in.
I'm gonna spin up the FTL drive just in case.
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
Say again, Shark.
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Buster, Shark, do you read?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read?
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?
Not sure, sir.
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, sir.
I want us to recheck that.
Okay, I need to check if we're getting some readouts on the problem.
Yeah?
All right, I'll check again.
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, sir.
Major Adama.
Commander Garner.
Glad to see you, Major, although I wish it was under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact with two of our Raptors out on a training mission.
What?
When did that happen?
Captain Thrace, perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring your Raptors, the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
Major.
You with me, Major?
Yes, sir.
They disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up!
We lose two Raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the Commander throws it in my face?
Don't all speak at once.
Sir, it's been made clear that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed.
Sorry, sir.
And whose frakking bright idea was that?
It was Garner, wasn't it?
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
Huh.
There's a hell of a combination.
I've a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I know how to handle her, sir.
And for the record, she is one hell of a Viper pilot.
What, I should cut her some slack because she's good in the cockpit, is that what you're saying?
Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
I can tell you that right now.
But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a Viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of our pants down there.
The engine room is like a finely-tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done in the proper way, at the proper time, in the proper order.
Or there'd be no power, no lights, no hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major, I think some of the people around here could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madam President, but it's that time.
Oh.
The campaign meeting.
Mmm-hmm.
You've been putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a presidential election coming up, unless you've decided not to run.
I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you, Tory.
I've thought about it a few times, but, no, I'm still here.
There's so much to do, so let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this?
I was precinct captain for the Federalist Party in Delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
Your presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and you've received enthusiastic endorsements from the Gemenese religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of leading this fleet?
Absolutely.
And for a time, I almost had a chance, until Laura Roslin ascended from politician to prophet.
The truth is, I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek, really, but I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics, as I find the vice-presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin would get old after a time, but it's the office that makes you the perfect candidate, Doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really?
To whom?
You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom?
You'll just step aside, will you?
I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
A man who remembers his friends.
Attention on deck.
At ease.
Where's Stinger?
He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
Stepped on his precious little toes.
Frakking Garner.
He's such an idiot.
He's just...
All right, lock that up!
Get something straight.
We got two missing Raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frakking jobs.
Now, we need to start thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything there is to know about these missing Raptors and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
Good.
Get to it.
How is she?
Rya's four months pregnant and doesn't wanna be.
I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what that's really all about?
Pretty straightforward, really.
I get a note that a girl is on the way, she arrives, I do my work, and she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little worried about you.
They've contacted me through the Gemenon representative.
My parents?
Oh, gods.
Do you have any idea what they would do to me?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway aboard a military ship.
Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
Hell, she could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it.
I want asylum.
Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents, and they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest, I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
Sarah.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but my people, my voters, are demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under Colonial law before the attacks, and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods.
You cannot equivocate on this point if you want our support in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah, very much, for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
Then don't.
But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
I'm gonna arrange a conference call with you and the Quorum, or this is gonna get out of hand, fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
What?
I hate to say this because I know that this is a political issue.
The fact is, that number doesn't go up very often.
I have fought for a woman's right to control her body my entire career.
No.
No.
I'm just remembering what you said right after the Cylon attack.
That if we really wanna save the human race, we better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where is Shark's last transmission?
Well, there's not much there.
"Eve, distress, bearing, wreck,"
"shuns, emerge, read."
They're in distress.
They give a bearing requesting instructions,
"it's an emergency.
Can you read?"
Maybe.
But what's this "eve" fragment here?
"Eve, distress." "Eve, distress."
Distress call.
Eve.
Receive...
Received.
Received distress call.
Okay.
From who?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where they went, to go find out.
Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing Raptors, sir.
That's good, considering she lost them.
Excuse me?
Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions, weren't they, Captain?
My "so-called" training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny.
Commander, we should take this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship?
"Barely competent and paranoid."
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialed.
Commander, I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behavior...
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters until I can ship you back to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major?
Sir.
You've been on board less than four days and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate?
I'm here to do a job.
Yeah, keep a loudmouth, disobedient, frak-up Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job, are you?
Evidently not.
We don't have much time, those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried, all right?
All I have done since I got to The Beast is try and help, and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass!
All right.
Here we go, finally.
What is your problem, anyway?
What's my problem?
What's my problem?
Well, Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it?
You mean since I got shot?
You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster or not?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates where our Raptors went missing.
Repeat, emer...
There are...
Buster, is that you?
This is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.
Out of power.
Oxygen almost out.
By the gods, help!
Sir, one of our search Raptors just picked a possible distress signal from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
A possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory?
Is this your theory, Major?
This is Captain Thrace's theory, is it not?
Mr. Thornton, can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from?
Yes, sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a Cylon trap, and...
And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we've finally got the break we've been looking for, a bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
The Cylons have been known to lure our ships into traps using fake distress calls.
Have you considered that?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.
We?
Major Adama, do you concur?
Sir,
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that the first two Raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, sir.
We'll send a recon mission in full force.
Five Raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections?
An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
So now it's our administration.
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother.
You needn't read the report.
If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be extinct.
Since assuming the Presidency, I've made it my mission to maintain the rights and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
One of these rights has now come into direct conflict with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if this civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet.
Therefore, I am issuing an executive order.
From this day forward, anyone seeking to interfere with the birth of a child, whether it be the mother or a medical practitioner, shall be subject to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
All right, come on.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Captain Case, what's going on?
We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump, we're gonna launch on the other side.
Get down to the hangar deck.
What?
Look, you're the best pilot we've got, so get down there, and find a Viper.
It's about time you admit that!
Commander, what's our sitrep?
This is a rescue mission, Major.
On whose authority?
Mine.
I'm bringing my pilots home.
All due respect, sir, but if this is a Cylon trap, then we are entering blind.
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying down there, Major.
I'm going in.
I'm not waiting on recon.
Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major, leave combat...
Making this an illegal action on your part, sir.
You are relieved, Major.
Sergeant of the Guard.
I am forced to take command of this vessel...
This man is in direct disobedience of an order... under federal regulations and place you under arrest.
Sergeant, take him below.
Sergeant, the Commander has been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
Major, if you'll come with me.
Admiral, the Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put us clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two Raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi, tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and let's bring our people home.
Aye, sir.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
I can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to raise the Raptors on wireless.
Pegasus, both Raptor crews are dead.
I repeat, they're all dead.
Sir, three Cylon Baseships just jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my gods.
They're launching nukes!
Brace for impact!
Damage report.
Two...
Two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir.
FTL drive inoperative, sir.
We're stuck here, sir.
All right, Showboat, you take Red Squadron, hit them on the right.
Catbird, you take Green, hit them on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Well, then the spinner's fine.
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just pull it.
Pull it!
Nuclear detonation.
There's structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
They can't take much more of this, how long before those drives are back up?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
Yes, sir.
I have the con.
Make for the nearest Baseship, and roll us over to keep our topside out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck and Case.
Tell them I've assumed command and to concentrate on protecting our topside.
Aye, sir.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact?
Negative, sir.
Give me this.
Can I get through there?
Baseship dead ahead.
We're closing rapidly.
We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
Helm, steady as you go.
Have the bow batteries stand by for salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
Yes, sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTLs fixed soon or we're dead.
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
Fire.
I wouldn't try it without a canteen, sir.
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
The pressure's dropping.
We've got a hull breach in there somewhere.
Well, we gotta get in there and open the auxiliary valve.
We can't do that, sir.
We have to!
Sir, that breach could vent all our oxygen into space!
We don't have a choice.
Now open the hatch!
Breathing gear?
We used it all in fighting the fire, sir.
Give me a sledge and a number 12 spanner.
Okay.
Now, close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air.
Close the goddamn hatch!
Close it!
The Baseship's turning away.
He's...
He's frakking running, Major!
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm, left full.
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
There's definitely air escaping through a crack over the FCC relay.
Your breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports Vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
They're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
We've got to haul ass outta here now, sir.
Sir!
Watch yourself, starboard side!
Come on, Garner.
O2's in the red, Skipper.
You're almost out of air.
You got it!
The pressure's coming back up!
Now get the frak outta there!
Come on!
Air's gone, Skipper.
Get out of there.
Skipper!
Engineering reporting a green board, FTL drive online and ready.
Okay, commence jump prep.
Bring our birds home.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Nobody behind me but toasters.
Now, get us out of here!
Air Wing's back on board.
Launch bays secure.
Jump.
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective and I had mine.
In your opinion, off the record, what was Garner's flaw?
He was used to working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that as you take command of The Beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's my responsibility.
Don't let me fail a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madam President, word has it that you do not intend to prosecute the Gemenese girl on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
And I think that Rya has suffered enough.
She's just been through an abortion.
I've granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
This is in total violation of the law.
My order came after she sought her procedure.
No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home with her parents.
I insist.
You have your pound of flesh, and I suggest you take your victory and you move on.
Ma'am.
You realize you're screwed, right?
All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights.
All the officers giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay here and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings, 'cause the XO's a lot of fun the first thing.
Great.
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why I was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you would've been sufficient.
Because you were doing what you always did.
Buck authority and get away with it.
I bucked authority once, and I almost lost everything.
So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus and there you were, doing it all over again...
I don't know.
It pissed me off.
Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
You should hear the way my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay?
You have a brain?
Madam President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor.
Do you think that's hurt your standing in the polls?
Absolutely.
If I may, Madam President.
It is true, in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters.
I would ask the people to understand that, if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times.
The decision has been made with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good conscience support it.
I'm so sorry, Madam President, but the Cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom.
How could they?
They're programmed machines.
Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time we restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them.
As the Vice President, lam bound to follow the administration's lead.
As President,
I should have no such strictures.
Given the current situation, I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the Presidency.
The Cylons were Created by Man
They Evolved
They Rebelled
There Are Many Copies
And They Have A Plan
Previously on Battlestar Galactica...
Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.
You have to really stay.
You must betray Roslin and run for presidente in the oncoming election **********
I know is hard, but it's the only way **********
Word of Fisk's murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
Crew can fall apart when their Commander is killed.

PEGASUS RAPTOR TRAINING EXERCISE
Pegasus, Buster.
Dradis intercept training birds are away.
Buster, Pegasus, roger that, take station... be advised,... communications will suffer sporadic interruptions... due to stellar EMI activity.
Acknowledge?
Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge.
Our communications suck!
Is it gonna be like this all day?
Big time.
Those binaries are putting out so much EMI,... even the dradis is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna a little distance between us and the fleet.
Get us out of the soup.
See if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Hey!
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go, come on!
Gotta a couple of tired viper jockeys out here wanna sleep.
Go hit the showers Duck!
We'll be gone by the time you get back.
How you feel?
Mm, not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up and it's been almost a month,... so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly of the beast?
The beast?
Yeah.
That's what they call the Pegasus now.
Galactica's the bucket.
The bucket and the beast.
Don't we make a pair?
Come on.
- No, you come on.
- Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you?
One word.
Starbuck.
Is she in hack again?
Not yet.
But apparently, she's been driving commander Garner... up one bulkhead and down the other... ever since she took over flight training on... what'd you call it?
The beast?
And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I...
Were you going to mention these?
Oh, yeah.
Got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy!
It doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Oh, well,... if you say so, then it must be true.
What's going on?
We were unloading one of the containers... and then one of the crates shifted.
So,... we looked inside, and saw that something was moving.
Did you call it in?
Yeah, we shut door, and the marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait?
Just wait out here.
Chief!
Is this the Galactica?
Yeah.
Are you Dr. Cottle?
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
We should call it in.
All right.
I gonna spin up the ftl drive just in case.
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
Emergency.
Request instructions.
Say again, Shark.
Pegasus... distress.
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Buster, Shark, do you read?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read?
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?
I'm not sure, sir.
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency,... but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, sir.
49.584 survivors in search of a home
Called Earth
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, sir.
Major Adama.
Commander Garner.
Glad to see you, Major.
Although I wish it was under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact with two of our raptors... out on a training mission.
What?
When did that happen?
Captain Thrace.
Perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck... and monitoring your raptors... the way any training officer worth a damn would have done,... you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
Major?
You with me, Major?
Yes, sir.
The disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up!
We lose two raptors in a training mission,... and I only find out when the commander throws it in my face.
Don't all speak at once.
Sir, it's been made clear... that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew... is not allowed.
Sorry, sir.
And whose frakkin' bright idea was that?
It was Garner, wasn't it?
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
There's a hell of a combination.
I have a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I-I know to handle her, sir.
And for the record, she is one hell of a viper pilot.
What?
I should cut her some slack because she's good in the cockpit.
Is that what you're saying?
Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
I could tell you that right now.
But then, uh,...
I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of our pants down there!
The engine room is like a finely tuned watch,... and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained... in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done in the proper way... at the proper time in the proper order!
Or there'd be no power.
No lights.
No hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major,...
I think some of the people around here... could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madame President.
But it's that time.
Campaign meeting.
We've been putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a Presidential election coming up... unless you've decided not to run.
Yeah, and to be perfectly honest with you, Tori,...
I've thought about it a few times.
But, um, no, I'm still here.
There's so much to do.
So... let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this?
I was precinct Captain for the federalist party... in delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
You're Presidential bid has the support of both the military... and the civilian fleet,... and you've received enthusiastic endorsements... from the Gemenese religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of leading this fleet?
Absolutely.
And for a time,...
I almost had a chance.
Until Laura Roslin ascended from... politician to prophet.
The truth is I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek.
Really.
But I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics... as I find the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin... would get old after a time.
But it's the office that makes you the perfect candidate, doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really?
To whom?
You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances... of cold science as opposed to the superstitious... ravings of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom.
You'll just step aside... will you?
I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
A man... who remembers his friends.
Attention on deck.
At ease.
Where's Stinger?
He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
Stepped on his precious little toes.
Frakking Garner.
He's such an idiot.
All right, lock that up!
Get something straight.
We got two missing raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So, everyone knock off the schoolyard crap... and start doing your frakkin' jobs.
Now... we need to start thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything there is to know about these missing raptors... and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks,... aircraft squawks,... wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
Good.
Get to it.
How is she?
Rya's four months pregnant and doesn't want to be.
I understand the Gemenese have a problem... with women terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what that's really all about?
Pretty straight forward, really.
I get a note that a girl's on the way.
She arrives.
I do my work.
And then she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little worried about you.
They've contacted me... through the Gemenon representative.
My parents.
Gods.
Do you have any idea what they would do to me?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway.
Aboard a military ship.
Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
Hell.
She could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it.
I want asylum.
Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents.
And they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest,...
I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
- Sarah.
- I know you don't want to hear this.
But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under colonial law before the attacks,... and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods.
You cannot equivocate on this point... if want our support in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah, very much for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
Then don't.
But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
I'm arranging a conference call with you and the quorum.
This is gonna get out of hand fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
What?
I hate to say this.
Because I know that this is a political issue.
The fact is that that number... doesn't go up very often.
I fought for a woman's right to control her body... my entire career.
No.
No.
I'm just remembering what you said.
Right after the cylon attack.
That if we really want to save the human race,... we'd better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where...is shark's last transmission?
Well... there's not much there.
"...
Eve...distress...bearing... reek...shuns...emerge-- read."
They were in distress.
They... give a bearing "requesting instructions... it's an emergency... can you read"?
Maybe, but what's this "eve" fragment here?
Eve...distress.
Eve...distress.
Distress call
Eve.
Recei-received?
Received distress call.
Okay.
From who?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where they went.
To go find out.
Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing raptors, sir.
That's good considering she lost them.
Excuse me?
Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions.
Weren't they, Captain?
My "so-called" training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny?
Commander, we should take this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship?
"Barely competent?
And paranoid?"
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialled.
Commander.
I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behavior.
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters.
Until I can ship you back to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major?
Yes, sir.
You've been on board less than four days,... and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate?
I'm here to do a job!
Yeah.
Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job, are ya?
Evidently not.
We don't have much time.
Those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried.
All right?
All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help,... and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass!
All right.
Here we go.
Finally.
What is your problem anyway?
What's my problem?
What's my problem?
Well Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up,... and I am officially... sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it?
You mean, since I got shot.
You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates where our raptors went missing.
Repeat...
Emergency...
Buster, is that you?
Buster, this is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.
Power failure... oxygen's almost out...
For love of the gods, help.
Sir!
One of our search raptors just picked up a possible distress signal... from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
Possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away... to run down a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory?
Is this your theory, major?
This is captain Thrace's theory, is it not?
Mr. Thornton.
Can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from?
Yes, sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive, and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, sir.
Sir!
This isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a cylon trap, and...
And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we finally got the break we've been looking for... bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
But the cylons have been known to lure ships into traps.
Using fake distressed calls.
Have you considered that?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.
We?
Major Adama, do you concur?
Sir...
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion... that the first two raptors... may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, sir.
We'll send a recon mission in full force.
Five raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections?
An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
So, now it's our administration?
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures... over seven months ago when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all, and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother, you needn't read the report.
If we continue on our present course,... within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be... extinct.
Since assuming the presidency,...
I've made it my mission to maintain the rights and freedoms... we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
One of these rights has now come into direct conflict... with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if the civilization is to survive,... we must, must repopulate this fleet.
Therefore, I'm issuing an executive order.
From this day forward,... anyone seeking to interfere with a birth of child,... whether it be the mother... or a medical practitioner... shall be subject to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
All right, come on, let's go, let's go!
Captain Case, what's going on?
We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump.
We're gonna launch on the other side.
- Get down to the hangar deck!
- What?
Look.
You're the best pilot we've got.
So, get down there.
Find a viper.
It's about time you admitted that!
Commander, what's our sitrep?
This is a rescue mission, Major.
- On whose authority?
- Mine.
I'm bringing my pilots home.
With all due respect, sir.
But if this is a cylon trap,... then we are entering blind!
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying down there, Major!
I'm going in, I'm not waiting on recon!
Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major.
Leave combat.
Making this an illegal action on your part, sir!
You are relieved, Major!
Sergeant of the guard.
I am forced to take command of this vessel!
- This man is in direct disobedience of an order...
- Under federal regulations...
- I want him under arrest!
- I place you under arrest!
Sergeant.
Take him below.
Sergeant, the commander's been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not a member of this crew,... and you will obey a direct order... that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
Major.
You'll come with me.
Admiral!
The Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put is clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi.
Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team,... and let's bring our people home.
Aye, sir.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
Can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to raise the raptors on wireless.
Oh, my gods.
Pegasus, both raptor crews are dead.
I repeat.
They're all dead.
Sir, three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my gods.
They're launching nukes!
Brace for impact.
Damage report?
Two...two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir.
FTL drive inoperative, sir.
We're stuck here, sir.
All right, Showboat.
You take red squadron.
Hit 'em on the right.
Catbird, you take green.
Hit 'em on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Oh, then the spinner's fine?
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no, listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just pull it, pull it!
Nuclear detonation.
We have structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
We can't take much more of this.
How long before... those drives are back up?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
Yes, sir.
I have the con.
Make for the nearest base ship.
And roll us over to keep our top side out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck in case... tell them I've assumed command.
And to concentrate on protecting our top side.
Aye, sir.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact?
Negative, sir.
Gimme that.
Can I get through there?
Base ship dead ahead, we're closing rapidly!
We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
Helm.
Steady as you go.
Have the bow battery stand by for a salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
Yes, sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTLs fixed soon.
Or we're dead.
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
And fire.
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
Pressure's dropping.
We gotta hull breach in there somewhere.
Well, we gotta get in there, and open the auxiliary valve!
We can't do that, sir!
We have to!
Sir, that breach can vent all our oxygen into space.
We don't have a choice.
Now, open the hatch.
Breathing gear?
We used it all up fighting the fires, sir.
Give me sledge and a number 12 spanner.
All right.
Now close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air,... close the gods damn hatch.
Close it!
Base ship's turning away.
He's--he's frakkin' running, Major!
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm... left, full.
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
Yes!
There's definitely air escaping.
Through a crack, over the SVC relay.
The breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
We're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
We gotta haul ass outta here now, sir!
Sir!
Come on, Garner.
O2's in the red, skipper.
You're almost out of air.
You got it!
The pressure's coming back up.
Now get the frak outta there, come on!
You're air is gone, skipper!
Get outta there!

Okay, commence jump prep.
Bring our birds home.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Nobody behind me but toasters.
Now get us outta here!
Air wing's back on board.
Landing bays secure.
Jump!
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective.
And I had mine.
In your opinion,... off the record... what was Garner's flaw?
He was used to working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that.
I want you to take command... of the beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's my responsibility.
Don't let me fail a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madame President?
Word has it that you do not intend... to prosecute the Gemenese girl on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
I think that Rya has suffered enough.
She's just been through an abortion.
I've granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
This is in total violation of the law.
My order came after she sought her procedure.
No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home, with her parents.
I insist.
You have your pound of flesh.
And I suggest you take your victory, and you move on.
Ma'am?
You realize you're screwed, right?
All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights,... all the officers giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay here and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
Well,... you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings.
'Cause the XO's a lot of fun first thing.
Great.
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why I was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you would have been sufficient.
'Cause you were doing what you always did.
Buck authority, and get away with it.
I bucked authority once.
And I almost lost everything.
So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus,... and there you were doing it all over again...
I don't know.
Pissed me off.
Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
You should hear the way my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay?
You have a brain?
Madame President, your decision to... criminalize abortion has created a furor.
Do you think that's hurt your standing in the polls?
Absolutely.
If I may, Madame President.
It is true in the light of recent events,... the President may have lost support in some quarters.
I would ask the people to understand that... if this is an extreme decision,... we live in extreme times.
The decision has been made with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good conscience support it.
I am so sorry, Madame President.
But the cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom.
How could they?
They're programmed.
Machines.
Every time you take away one of our freedoms,... every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights,... we become one step closer to being like them.
As the vice-president,...
I am bound to follow the administration's lead.
As president...
I should have no such strictures.
Given the current situation,...
I'm afraid that I have no alternative... but to announce that I am, as of now,... a candidate for the presidency.
Are you you resigning the vice presidency?
Are you a one-issue candidate?
Are you being disloyal to the President?

PEGASUS RAPTOR TRAINING EXERCISE
Pegasus, Buster.
Dradis intercept training birds are away.
Buster, Pegasus, roger that, take station... be advised,... communications will suffer sporadic interruptions... due to stellar EMI activity.
Acknowledge?
Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge.
Our communications suck!
Is it gonna be like this all day?
Big time.
Those binaries are putting out so much EMI,... even the dradis is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna a little distance between us and the fleet.
Get us out of the soup.
See if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Hey!
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go, come on!
Gotta a couple of tired viper jockeys out here wanna sleep.
Go hit the showers Duck!
We'll be gone by the time you get back.
How you feel?
Mm, not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up and it's been almost a month,... so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly of the beast?
The beast?
Yeah.
That's what they call the Pegasus now.
Galactica's the bucket.
The bucket and the beast.
Don't we make a pair?
Come on.
- No, you come on.
- Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you?
One word.
Starbuck.
Is she in hack again?
Not yet.
But apparently, she's been driving commander Garner... up one bulkhead and down the other... ever since she took over flight training on... what'd you call it?
The beast?
And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I...
Were you going to mention these?
Oh, yeah.
Got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy!
It doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Oh, well,... if you say so, then it must be true.
What's going on?
We were unloading one of the containers... and then one of the crates shifted.
So,... we looked inside, and saw that something was moving.
Did you call it in?
Yeah, we shut door, and the marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait?
Just wait out here.
Chief!
Is this the Galactica?
Yeah.
Are you Dr. Cottle?
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
We should call it in.
All right.
I gonna spin up the ftl drive just in case.
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
Emergency.
Request instructions.
Say again, Shark.
Pegasus... distress.
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Buster, Shark, do you read?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read?
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?
I'm not sure, sir.
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency,... but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, sir.
49.584 survivors in search of a home
Called Earth
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, sir.
Major Adama.
Commander Garner.
Glad to see you, Major.
Although I wish it was under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact with two of our raptors... out on a training mission.
What?
When did that happen?
Captain Thrace.
Perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck... and monitoring your raptors... the way any training officer worth a damn would have done,... you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
Major?
You with me, Major?
Yes, sir.
The disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up!
We lose two raptors in a training mission,... and I only find out when the commander throws it in my face.
Don't all speak at once.
Sir, it's been made clear... that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew... is not allowed.
Sorry, sir.
And whose frakkin' bright idea was that?
It was Garner, wasn't it?
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
There's a hell of a combination.
I have a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I-I know to handle her, sir.
And for the record, she is one hell of a viper pilot.
What?
I should cut her some slack because she's good in the cockpit.
Is that what you're saying?
Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
I could tell you that right now.
But then, uh,...
I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of our pants down there!
The engine room is like a finely tuned watch,... and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained... in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done in the proper way... at the proper time in the proper order!
Or there'd be no power.
No lights.
No hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major,...
I think some of the people around here... could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madame President.
But it's that time.
Campaign meeting.
We've been putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a Presidential election coming up... unless you've decided not to run.
Yeah, and to be perfectly honest with you, Tori,...
I've thought about it a few times.
But, um, no, I'm still here.
There's so much to do.
So... let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this?
I was precinct Captain for the federalist party... in delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
You're Presidential bid has the support of both the military... and the civilian fleet,... and you've received enthusiastic endorsements... from the Gemenese religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of leading this fleet?
Absolutely.
And for a time,...
I almost had a chance.
Until Laura Roslin ascended from... politician to prophet.
The truth is I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek.
Really.
But I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics... as I find the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin... would get old after a time.
But it's the office that makes you the perfect candidate, doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really?
To whom?
You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances... of cold science as opposed to the superstitious... ravings of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom.
You'll just step aside... will you?
I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
A man... who remembers his friends.
Attention on deck.
At ease.
Where's Stinger?
He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
Stepped on his precious little toes.
Frakking Garner.
He's such an idiot.
All right, lock that up!
Get something straight.
We got two missing raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So, everyone knock off the schoolyard crap... and start doing your frakkin' jobs.
Now... we need to start thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything there is to know about these missing raptors... and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks,... aircraft squawks,... wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
Good.
Get to it.
How is she?
Rya's four months pregnant and doesn't want to be.
I understand the Gemenese have a problem... with women terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what that's really all about?
Pretty straight forward, really.
I get a note that a girl's on the way.
She arrives.
I do my work.
And then she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little worried about you.
They've contacted me... through the Gemenon representative.
My parents.
Gods.
Do you have any idea what they would do to me?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway.
Aboard a military ship.
Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
Hell.
She could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it.
I want asylum.
Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents.
And they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest,...
I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
- Sarah.
- I know you don't want to hear this.
But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under colonial law before the attacks,... and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods.
You cannot equivocate on this point... if want our support in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah, very much for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
Then don't.
But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
I'm arranging a conference call with you and the quorum.
This is gonna get out of hand fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
What?
I hate to say this.
Because I know that this is a political issue.
The fact is that that number... doesn't go up very often.
I fought for a woman's right to control her body... my entire career.
No.
No.
I'm just remembering what you said.
Right after the cylon attack.
That if we really want to save the human race,... we'd better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where...is shark's last transmission?
Well... there's not much there.
"...
Eve...distress...bearing... reek...shuns...emerge-- read."
They were in distress.
They... give a bearing "requesting instructions... it's an emergency... can you read"?
Maybe, but what's this "eve" fragment here?
Eve...distress.
Eve...distress.
Distress call
Eve.
Recei-received?
Received distress call.
Okay.
From who?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where they went.
To go find out.
Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing raptors, sir.
That's good considering she lost them.
Excuse me?
Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions.
Weren't they, Captain?
My "so-called" training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny?
Commander, we should take this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship?
"Barely competent?
And paranoid?"
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialled.
Commander.
I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behavior.
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters.
Until I can ship you back to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major?
Yes, sir.
You've been on board less than four days,... and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate?
I'm here to do a job!
Yeah.
Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job, are ya?
Evidently not.
We don't have much time.
Those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried.
All right?
All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help,... and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass!
All right.
Here we go.
Finally.
What is your problem anyway?
What's my problem?
What's my problem?
Well Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up,... and I am officially... sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it?
You mean, since I got shot.
You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates where our raptors went missing.
Repeat...
Emergency...
Buster, is that you?
Buster, this is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.
Power failure... oxygen's almost out...
For love of the gods, help.
Sir!
One of our search raptors just picked up a possible distress signal... from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
Possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away... to run down a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory?
Is this your theory, major?
This is captain Thrace's theory, is it not?
Mr. Thornton.
Can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from?
Yes, sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive, and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, sir.
Sir!
This isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a cylon trap, and...
And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we finally got the break we've been looking for... bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
But the cylons have been known to lure ships into traps.
Using fake distressed calls.
Have you considered that?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.
We?
Major Adama, do you concur?
Sir...
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion... that the first two raptors... may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, sir.
We'll send a recon mission in full force.
Five raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections?
An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
So, now it's our administration?
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures... over seven months ago when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all, and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother, you needn't read the report.
If we continue on our present course,... within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be... extinct.
Since assuming the presidency,...
I've made it my mission to maintain the rights and freedoms... we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
One of these rights has now come into direct conflict... with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if the civilization is to survive,... we must, must repopulate this fleet.
Therefore, I'm issuing an executive order.
From this day forward,... anyone seeking to interfere with a birth of child,... whether it be the mother... or a medical practitioner... shall be subject to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
All right, come on, let's go, let's go!
Captain Case, what's going on?
We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump.
We're gonna launch on the other side.
- Get down to the hangar deck!
- What?
Look.
You're the best pilot we've got.
So, get down there.
Find a viper.
It's about time you admitted that!
Commander, what's our sitrep?
This is a rescue mission, Major.
- On whose authority?
- Mine.
I'm bringing my pilots home.
With all due respect, sir.
But if this is a cylon trap,... then we are entering blind!
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying down there, Major!
I'm going in, I'm not waiting on recon!
Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major.
Leave combat.
Making this an illegal action on your part, sir!
You are relieved, Major!
Sergeant of the guard.
I am forced to take command of this vessel!
- This man is in direct disobedience of an order...
- Under federal regulations...
- I want him under arrest!
- I place you under arrest!
Sergeant.
Take him below.
Sergeant, the commander's been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not a member of this crew,... and you will obey a direct order... that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
Major.
You'll come with me.
Admiral!
The Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put is clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi.
Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team,... and let's bring our people home.
Aye, sir.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
Can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to raise the raptors on wireless.
Oh, my gods.
Pegasus, both raptor crews are dead.
I repeat.
They're all dead.
Sir, three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my gods.
They're launching nukes!
Brace for impact.
Damage report?
Two...two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir.
FTL drive inoperative, sir.
We're stuck here, sir.
All right, Showboat.
You take red squadron.
Hit 'em on the right.
Catbird, you take green.
Hit 'em on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Oh, then the spinner's fine?
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no, listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just pull it, pull it!
Nuclear detonation.
We have structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
We can't take much more of this.
How long before... those drives are back up?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
Yes, sir.
I have the con.
Make for the nearest base ship.
And roll us over to keep our top side out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck in case... tell them I've assumed command.
And to concentrate on protecting our top side.
Aye, sir.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact?
Negative, sir.
Gimme that.
Can I get through there?
Base ship dead ahead, we're closing rapidly!
We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
Helm.
Steady as you go.
Have the bow battery stand by for a salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
Yes, sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTLs fixed soon.
Or we're dead.
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
And fire.
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
Pressure's dropping.
We gotta hull breach in there somewhere.
Well, we gotta get in there, and open the auxiliary valve!
We can't do that, sir!
We have to!
Sir, that breach can vent all our oxygen into space.
We don't have a choice.
Now, open the hatch.
Breathing gear?
We used it all up fighting the fires, sir.
Give me sledge and a number 12 spanner.
All right.
Now close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air,... close the gods damn hatch.
Close it!
Base ship's turning away.
He's--he's frakkin' running, Major!
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm... left, full.
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
Yes!
There's definitely air escaping.
Through a crack, over the SVC relay.
The breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
We're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
We gotta haul ass outta here now, sir!
Sir!
Come on, Garner.
O2's in the red, skipper.
You're almost out of air.
You got it!
The pressure's coming back up.
Now get the frak outta there, come on!
You're air is gone, skipper!
Get outta there!
Skipper?
Engineering's reporting a green board.

Okay, commence jump prep.

Landing bays secure.
Jump!
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective.
And I had mine.
In your opinion,... off the record... what was Garner's flaw?
He was used to working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that.
I want you to take command... of the beast.

Word of Fisk's murder spread out to the entire fleet.
Crew can fall apart when their Commander is killed.

But he's an engineer, not a command officer.
He's the best they've got.

Dradis intercept training birds are away.
Buster, Pegasus, roger that, take station...
be advised... communications... will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar EMI activity.
Acknowledge ?
Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge.
Our communications suck .
Is it gonna be like this all day ?
- Big time.
Those binaries are putting out so much EMI, even the dradis is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna put a little distance between us and the fleet.
Get us out of the soup.
See if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Whoever's in there, time's up .
Let's go, come on .
Gotta a couple of tired Viper jockeys out here wanna sleep.
Go hit the showers Duck .
We'll be gone by the time you get back.
How you feel ?
Not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up... and it's been almost a month, so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly of the beast ?
The beast ?
- Yeah.
That's what they call the Pegasus now.
Galactica's the bucket.
The bucket and the beast.
Don't we make a pair ?
Come on.
No, you come on.
- Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you ?
One word.
Starbuck.
Is she in hack again ?
Not yet.
But apparently, she's been driving commander Garner up one bulkhead... and down the other ever since she took over flight training on--
What'd you call it ?
The beast ?
And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I--
Were you going to mention these ?
Oh, yeah.
Got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy .
It doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Well, if you say so, then it must be true.
What's going on ?
We were unloading one of the containers and one of the crates shifted.
So, we looked inside, and saw that something was moving.
Did you call it in ?
Yeah, we shut the door, and the marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait ?
Just wait out here.
Chief .
Is this the Galactica ?
Yeah.
Are you Dr. Cottle ?
... in distress...
What the hell was that ?
I don't know.
We should call it in.
I gonna spin up the FTL drive just in case.
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
Emergency... request...
Say again, Shark.
Eve... distress bearing... reek... shuns...
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency ?
Buster, Shark, do you read ?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency ?
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read ?
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi ?
- I'm not sure, Sir.
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, Sir.
Season 2
- Episode 17 The Captain's Hand
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, Sir.
Major Adama.
Cdr.
Garner.
Glad to see you, Major.
Although I wish it was under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact with two of our Raptors out on a training mission.
What ?
When did that happen ?
Captain Thrace.
Perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring... your Raptors the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
Major ?
You with me, Major ?
Yes, Sir.
They disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up .
We lose two Raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the commander throws it in my face.
Don't all speak at once.
- Sir, it's been made clear... that discussing flight deck situations... with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed.
Sorry, Sir.
And whose frakkin'bright idea was that ?
It was Garner, wasn't it ?
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
There's a hell of a combination.
I have a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I know to handle her, Sir.
And for the record, she is one hell of a Viper pilot.
What ?
I should cut her some slack... because she's good in the cockpit, is that what you're saying ?
Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
I could tell you that right now.
But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a Viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of our pants down there .
The engine room is like a finely tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained... in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done in the proper way at the proper time in the proper order .
Or there'd be no power.
No lights.
No hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major, I think some of the people around here... could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madame President.
But it's that time.
Campaign meeting.
We've been putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a presidential election coming up... unless you've decided not to run.
Yeah and to be perfectly honest with you, I've thought about it a few times but...
No, I'm still here.
There's so much to do, so...
Let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this ?
I was Precinct Captain for the federalist party... in Delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the Mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
You're presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and you've received enthusiastic endorsements from the gemenese religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of leading this fleet ?
Absolutely.
And for a time,
I almost had a chance.
Until Laura Roslin ascended... from politician to prophet.
The truth is I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek.
Really.
But I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics as I find... the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin... would get old after a time, but it's the office... that makes you the perfect candidate, Doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really ?
To whom ?
You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances... of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings... of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom.
You'll just step aside, will you ?
I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
A man... who remembers his friends.
Attention on deck.
At ease.
Where's Stinger ?
- He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
He stepped on his precious little toes.
Fracking Garner.
He's such an idiot.
- All right, lock that up .
Get something straight.
We got two missing Raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So, everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frackin'jobs.
Now...
We need to start thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything about these missing Raptors and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
Good, get to it.
How is she ?
- Rya's four months pregnant... and doesn't want to be.
I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what that's really all about ?
Pretty straightforward, really.
I get a note that a girl's on the way, she arrives, I do my work and she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
- You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little worried about you.
They've contacted me through the gemenon representative.
My parents.
Gods...
Do you have any idea what they would do to me ?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway... aboard a military ship.
Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
Hell, she could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it.
I want asylum.
Under gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents... and they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest,
I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
Sarah.
- I know you don't want to hear this.
But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under colonial law... before the attacks and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The Scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the Gods.
You cannot equivocate on this point... if you want our support in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah, very much for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
Then don't.
But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
I'm gonna arrange a conference call, you and the Quorum... either this is gonna get out of hand fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
What ?
I hate to say this.
Because I know that this is a political issue.
The fact is that that number... doesn't go up very often.
I fought for a woman's right to control her body my entire career.
No...
No.
I'm just remembering what you said.
Right after the cylon attack.
That if we really want to save the human race, we'd better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where... is shark's last transmission ?
Well... there's not much there.
'Eve... distress... bearing... reek... shuns... emerge... read.'
They're in distress.
They give a bearing 'requesting instructions... it's an emergency... can you read'?
Maybe, but what's this 'eve' fragment here ?
Eve... distress.
Eve... distress.
Eve.
Recei-received ?
Received distress call.
Okay.
From who ?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where they went.
To go find out.
Commander,
Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing Raptors, Sir.
That's good considering she lost them.
Excuse me ?
They were out on one of your so-called training missions.
Werent't they ?
My 'so-called' training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny ?
Cdr. , we should take this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship ?
'Barely competent ?
And paranoid ?
'
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialled.
Commander.
I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behavior.
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters.
Until I can ship you back to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major ?
- Yes, Sir.
You've been on board less than four days, and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you ?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate ?
I'm here to do a job .
Yeah.
Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job, are ya ?
- Evidently not.
We don't have much time.
Those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried.
All right ?
All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help, and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass .
All right.
Here we go.
Finally.
What is your problem anyway ?
What's my problem ?
What's my problem ?
Well Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially... sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it ?
You mean, since I got shot.
You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not ?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates where our Raptors went missing.
Repeat, emer...
We are in dist...
Buster, is that you ?
Buster, this is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy ?
Come back to me.
Power failure...
oxygen's almost out of the Gods, help...
Sir .
One of our search Raptor just picked up a possible distress signal... from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
Possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down... a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory ?
Is this your theory, Major ?
This is Captain Thrace's theory, is it not ?
Mr. Thornton.
Can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from ?
Yes, Sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive, and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, Sir.
Sir.
This isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a cylon trap, and--
- And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we finally got the break we've been looking for bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
But the Cylons have been known to lure ships into traps.
Using fake distressed calls.
Have you considered that ?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.
- We ?
Major Adama, do you concur ?
Sir...
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that... the first two Raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, Sir.
We'll send a recon mission in full force.
Five Raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Yes, Sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections ?
An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
So, now it's our administration ?
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago... when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all, and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother, you needn't read the report.
If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be... extinct.
Since assuming the presidency, I've made it my mission to maintain the rights... and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
one of these rights has now come into direct conflict... with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if the civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet.
Therefore, I'm issuing an executive order.
From this day forward, anyone seeking to interfere with a birth of child, whether it be the mother... or a medical practitioner... shall be subject to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
All right, come on, let's go, let's go .
Captain Case, what's going on ?
We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump.
We're gonna launch on the other side.
Get down to the hangar deck .
- What ?
Look.
You're the best pilot we've got.
So, get down there.
Find a Viper.
It's about time you admitted that .
Cdr. , what's our sitrep ?
- This is a rescue mission, Major.
On whose authority ?
- Mine.
I'm bringing my pilots home.
With all due respect, Sir, but if this is a cylon trap, then we are entering blind.
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying down there, Major .
I'm going in, I'm not waiting on recon .
This is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major.
Leave combat.
- Making this an illegal action... on your part, Sir .
- You are relieved, Major .
I am forced to take command of this vessel .
Under federal regulations, I place you under arrest .
Sergeant.
Take him below.
Sergeant, the Commander's been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey... a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
Major.
You'll come with me.
Admiral .
The Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put is clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two Raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi.
Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and let's bring our people home.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
Can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to raise the Raptors on wireless.
Pegasus, both Raptor crews are dead.
I repeat.
They're all dead.
Sir, three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my Gods.
They're launching nukes .
Brace for impact.
Damage report ?
Two nuclear detonations in the stern, Sir.
FTL drive inoperative, Sir.
- We're stuck here, Sir.
All right, Showboat.
You take Red Squadron.
Hit'em on the right.
Catbird, you take Green.
Hit'em on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Then the spinner's fine ?
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no, listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just pull it, pull it .
Nuclear detonation.
We have structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
We can't take much more of this.
How long before those drives are back up ?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
Yes, Sir.
I have the con.
Make for the nearest base ship.
And roll us over to keep our top side out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck and Case.
Tell them I've assumed command.
and to concentrate on protecting our top side.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact ?
Negative, Sir.
Base ship dead ahead, we're closing rapidly .
We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
Helm.
Steady as you go.
Have the bow battery stand by for a salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
- Yes, Sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTIs fixed soon.
Or we're dead.
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
Fire.
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
Pressure's dropping.
We gotta hull breach in there somewhere.
We gotta get in there, and open the auxiliary valve .
We can't do that, sir .
- We have to .
Sir, that breach can vent all our oxygen into space.
We don't have a choice.
Now, open the hatch.
Breathing gear ?
We used it all up fighting the fires, Sir.
Give me sledge... and a number 12 spanner.
OK.
Now close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air, close the Gods damn hatch.
Close it .
Base ship's turning away.
He's fracking running, Major .
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm .
Left, full .
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
Yes .
There's definitely air escaping.
Through a crack over the SVC relay.
The breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports Vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
We're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
We gotta haul ass outta here now, Sir .
Sir .
Come on, Garner.
O2's in the red, skipper.
You're almost out of air.
You got it .
The pressure's coming back up.
Now get the frack outta there, come on .
Air is gone, skipper, get outta there .
Skipper ?
Engineering's reporting a green board.
FTL drive online and ready.
Okay, commence jump prep.
Bring our birds home.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Nobody behind me but toasters.
Now get us outta here .
- Air wing's back on board.
Landing bays secure.
Jump .
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective.
And I had mine.
In your opinion, off the record...
What was Garner's flaw ?
He was used to working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that.
As you take command... of the beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's my responsibility.
Don't let me fail a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madame President.
Word has it that you do not intend... to prosecute the gemenese girl on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
I think that Rya has suffered enough.
She's just been through an abortion.
I've granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
This is in total violation of the law.
My order came after she sought her procedure.
No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home, with her parents.
I insist.
You have your pound of flesh.
And I suggest you take your victory and you move on.
Ma'am...
You realize you're screwed, right ?
All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights, all the officers giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay here and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings.
'Cause the XO's a lot of fun first thing.
Great...
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why I was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you would have been sufficient.
'Cause you were doing what you always did.
Buck authority, and get away with it.
I bucked authority once.
And I almost lost everything.
So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus and there you were... doing it all over again.
I don't know.
Pissed me off.
Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it ?
You should hear the way my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay ?
You have a brain ?
Madame President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor.
Do you think that's hurt your standing in the polls ?
Absolutely.
- If I may, Madame President.
It is true in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters.
I would ask the people to understand that if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times.
The decision has been made with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good conscience support it.
I am so sorry, Madame President.
But the Cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom.
How could they ?
They're programmed.
Machines...
Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them.
As the Vice President,
I am bound to follow the administration's lead.
As President...
I should have no such strictures.
Given the current situation,
I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the presidency.
Previously, on Battlestar Galactica
Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.
You have to really stay.
You must betray Roslin and run for president in the upcoming election.
I know it's hard, but it's the only way.
Word of Fisk's murder spread out to the entire fleet.
Crew can fall apart when their Commander is killed.
Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
I'm puting Garner in command.
But he's an engineer, not a command officer.
He's the best they've got.
Pegasus, Buster.
Dradis intercept training birds are away.
Buster, Pegasus, roger that, take station...
be advised... communications... will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar EMI activity.
Acknowledge ?
Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge.
Our communications suck .
Is it gonna be like this all day ?
- Big time.
Those binaries are putting out so much EMI, even the dradis is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna put a little distance between us and the fleet.
Get us out of the soup.
See if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Whoever's in there, time's up .
Let's go, come on .
Gotta a couple of tired Viper jockeys out here wanna sleep.
Go hit the showers Duck .
We'll be gone by the time you get back.
How you feel ?
Not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up... and it's been almost a month, so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly of the beast ?
The beast ?
- Yeah.
That's what they call the Pegasus now.
Galactica's the bucket.
The bucket and the beast.
Don't we make a pair ?
Come on.
No, you come on.
- Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you ?
One word.
Starbuck.
Is she in hack again ?
Not yet.
But apparently, she's been driving commander Garner up one bulkhead... and down the other ever since she took over flight training on--
What'd you call it ?
The beast ?
And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I--
Were you going to mention these ?
Oh, yeah.
Got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy .
It doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Well, if you say so, then it must be true.
What's going on ?
We were unloading one of the containers and one of the crates shifted.
So, we looked inside, and saw that something was moving.
Did you call it in ?
Yeah, we shut the door, and the marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait ?
Just wait out here.
Chief .
Is this the Galactica ?
Yeah.
Are you Dr. Cottle ?
... in distress...
What the hell was that ?
I don't know.
We should call it in.
I gonna spin up the FTL drive just in case.
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
Emergency... request...
Say again, Shark.
Eve... distress bearing... reek... shuns...
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency ?
Buster, Shark, do you read ?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency ?
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read ?
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi ?
- I'm not sure, Sir.
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, Sir.
Season 2
- Episode 17 The Captain's Hand
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, Sir.
Major Adama.
Cdr.
Garner.
Glad to see you, Major.
Although I wish it was under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact with two of our Raptors out on a training mission.
What ?
When did that happen ?
Captain Thrace.
Perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring... your Raptors the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
Major ?
You with me, Major ?
Yes, Sir.
They disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up .
We lose two Raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the commander throws it in my face.
Don't all speak at once.
- Sir, it's been made clear... that discussing flight deck situations... with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed.
Sorry, Sir.
And whose frakkin'bright idea was that ?
It was Garner, wasn't it ?
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
There's a hell of a combination.
I have a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I know to handle her, Sir.
And for the record, she is one hell of a Viper pilot.
What ?
I should cut her some slack... because she's good in the cockpit, is that what you're saying ?
Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
I could tell you that right now.
But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a Viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of our pants down there .
The engine room is like a finely tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained... in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done in the proper way at the proper time in the proper order .
Or there'd be no power.
No lights.
No hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major, I think some of the people around here... could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madame President.
But it's that time.
Campaign meeting.
We've been putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a presidential election coming up... unless you've decided not to run.
Yeah and to be perfectly honest with you, I've thought about it a few times but...
No, I'm still here.
There's so much to do, so...
Let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this ?
I was Precinct Captain for the federalist party... in Delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the Mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
You're presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and you've received enthusiastic endorsements from the gemenese religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of leading this fleet ?
Absolutely.
And for a time,
I almost had a chance.
Until Laura Roslin ascended... from politician to prophet.
The truth is I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek.
Really.
But I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics as I find... the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin... would get old after a time, but it's the office... that makes you the perfect candidate, Doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really ?
To whom ?
You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances... of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings... of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom.
You'll just step aside, will you ?
I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
A man... who remembers his friends.
Attention on deck.
At ease.
Where's Stinger ?
- He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
He stepped on his precious little toes.
Fracking Garner.
He's such an idiot.
- All right, lock that up .
Get something straight.
We got two missing Raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So, everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frackin'jobs.
Now...
We need to start thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything about these missing Raptors and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
Good, get to it.
How is she ?
- Rya's four months pregnant... and doesn't want to be.
I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what that's really all about ?
Pretty straightforward, really.
I get a note that a girl's on the way, she arrives, I do my work and she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
- You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little worried about you.
They've contacted me through the gemenon representative.
My parents.
Gods...
Do you have any idea what they would do to me ?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway... aboard a military ship.
Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
Hell, she could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it.
I want asylum.
Under gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents... and they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest,
I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
Sarah.
- I know you don't want to hear this.
But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under colonial law... before the attacks and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The Scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the Gods.
You cannot equivocate on this point... if you want our support in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah, very much for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
Then don't.
But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
I'm gonna arrange a conference call, you and the Quorum... either this is gonna get out of hand fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
What ?
I hate to say this.
Because I know that this is a political issue.
The fact is that that number... doesn't go up very often.
I fought for a woman's right to control her body my entire career.
No...
No.
I'm just remembering what you said.
Right after the cylon attack.
That if we really want to save the human race, we'd better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where... is shark's last transmission ?
Well... there's not much there.
'Eve... distress... bearing... reek... shuns... emerge... read.'
They're in distress.
They give a bearing 'requesting instructions... it's an emergency... can you read'?
Maybe, but what's this 'eve' fragment here ?
Eve... distress.
Eve... distress.
Eve.
Recei-received ?
Received distress call.
Okay.
From who ?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where they went.
To go find out.
Commander,
Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing Raptors, Sir.
That's good considering she lost them.
Excuse me ?
They were out on one of your so-called training missions.
Werent't they ?
My 'so-called' training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny ?
Cdr. , we should take this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship ?
'Barely competent ?
And paranoid ?
'
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialled.
Commander.
I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behavior.
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters.
Until I can ship you back to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major ?
- Yes, Sir.
You've been on board less than four days, and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you ?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate ?
I'm here to do a job .
Yeah.
Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job, are ya ?
- Evidently not.
We don't have much time.
Those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried.
All right ?
All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help, and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass .
All right.
Here we go.
Finally.
What is your problem anyway ?
What's my problem ?
What's my problem ?
Well Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially... sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it ?
You mean, since I got shot.
You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not ?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates where our Raptors went missing.
Repeat, emer...
We are in dist...
Buster, is that you ?
Buster, this is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy ?
Come back to me.
Power failure...
oxygen's almost out of the Gods, help...
Sir .
One of our search Raptor just picked up a possible distress signal... from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
Possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down... a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory ?
Is this your theory, Major ?
This is Captain Thrace's theory, is it not ?
Mr. Thornton.
Can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from ?
Yes, Sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive, and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, Sir.
Sir.
This isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a cylon trap, and--
- And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we finally got the break we've been looking for bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
But the Cylons have been known to lure ships into traps.
Using fake distressed calls.
Have you considered that ?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.
- We ?
Major Adama, do you concur ?
Sir...
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that... the first two Raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, Sir.
We'll send a recon mission in full force.
Five Raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Yes, Sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections ?
An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
So, now it's our administration ?
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago... when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all, and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother, you needn't read the report.
If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be... extinct.
Since assuming the presidency, I've made it my mission to maintain the rights... and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
one of these rights has now come into direct conflict... with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if the civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet.
Therefore, I'm issuing an executive order.
From this day forward, anyone seeking to interfere with a birth of child, whether it be the mother... or a medical practitioner... shall be subject to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
All right, come on, let's go, let's go .
Captain Case, what's going on ?
We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump.
We're gonna launch on the other side.
Get down to the hangar deck .
- What ?
Look.
You're the best pilot we've got.
So, get down there.
Find a Viper.
It's about time you admitted that .
Cdr. , what's our sitrep ?
- This is a rescue mission, Major.
On whose authority ?
- Mine.
I'm bringing my pilots home.
With all due respect, Sir, but if this is a cylon trap, then we are entering blind.
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying down there, Major .
I'm going in, I'm not waiting on recon .
This is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major.
Leave combat.
- Making this an illegal action... on your part, Sir .
- You are relieved, Major .
I am forced to take command of this vessel .
Under federal regulations, I place you under arrest .
Sergeant.
Take him below.
Sergeant, the Commander's been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey... a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
Major.
You'll come with me.
Admiral .
The Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put is clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two Raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi.
Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and let's bring our people home.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
Can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to raise the Raptors on wireless.
Pegasus, both Raptor crews are dead.
I repeat.
They're all dead.
Sir, three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my Gods.
They're launching nukes .
Brace for impact.
Damage report ?
Two nuclear detonations in the stern, Sir.
FTL drive inoperative, Sir.
- We're stuck here, Sir.
All right, Showboat.
You take Red Squadron.
Hit'em on the right.
Catbird, you take Green.
Hit'em on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Then the spinner's fine ?
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no, listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just pull it, pull it .
Nuclear detonation.
We have structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
We can't take much more of this.
How long before those drives are back up ?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
Yes, Sir.
I have the con.
Make for the nearest base ship.
And roll us over to keep our top side out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck and Case.
Tell them I've assumed command.
and to concentrate on protecting our top side.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact ?
Negative, Sir.
Base ship dead ahead, we're closing rapidly .
We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
Helm.
Steady as you go.
Have the bow battery stand by for a salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
- Yes, Sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTIs fixed soon.
Or we're dead.
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
Fire.
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
Pressure's dropping.
We gotta hull breach in there somewhere.
We gotta get in there, and open the auxiliary valve .
We can't do that, sir .
- We have to .
Sir, that breach can vent all our oxygen into space.
We don't have a choice.
Now, open the hatch.
Breathing gear ?
We used it all up fighting the fires, Sir.
Give me sledge... and a number 12 spanner.
OK.
Now close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air, close the Gods damn hatch.
Close it .
Base ship's turning away.
He's fracking running, Major .
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm .
Left, full .
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
Yes .
There's definitely air escaping.
Through a crack over the SVC relay.
The breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports Vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
We're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
We gotta haul ass outta here now, Sir .
Sir .
Come on, Garner.
O2's in the red, skipper.
You're almost out of air.
You got it .
The pressure's coming back up.
Now get the frack outta there, come on .
Air is gone, skipper, get outta there .
Skipper ?
Engineering's reporting a green board.
FTL drive online and ready.
Okay, commence jump prep.
Bring our birds home.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Nobody behind me but toasters.
Now get us outta here .
- Air wing's back on board.
Landing bays secure.
Jump .
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective.
And I had mine.
In your opinion, off the record...
What was Garner's flaw ?
He was used to working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that.
As you take command... of the beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's my responsibility.
Don't let me fail a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madame President.
Word has it that you do not intend... to prosecute the gemenese girl on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
I think that Rya has suffered enough.
She's just been through an abortion.
I've granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
This is in total violation of the law.
My order came after she sought her procedure.
No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home, with her parents.
I insist.
You have your pound of flesh.
And I suggest you take your victory and you move on.
Ma'am...
You realize you're screwed, right ?
All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights, all the officers giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay here and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings.
'Cause the XO's a lot of fun first thing.
Great...
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why I was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you would have been sufficient.
'Cause you were doing what you always did.
Buck authority, and get away with it.
I bucked authority once.
And I almost lost everything.
So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus and there you were... doing it all over again.
I don't know.
Pissed me off.
Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it ?
You should hear the way my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay ?
You have a brain ?
Madame President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor.
Do you think that's hurt your standing in the polls ?
Absolutely.
- If I may, Madame President.
It is true in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters.
I would ask the people to understand that if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times.
The decision has been made with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good conscience support it.
I am so sorry, Madame President.
But the Cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom.
How could they ?
They're programmed.
Machines...
Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them.
As the Vice President,
I am bound to follow the administration's lead.
As President...
I should have no such strictures.
Given the current situation,
I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the presidency.
NARRATOR:
Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
(GUN FIRING)
Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.
You have to really stay.
GINA:
You must betray Roslin and run for President in the upcoming election.
I know it's hard, but it's the only way.
Word of Fisk's murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
TIGH:
A crew can fall apart when their commander's killed.
Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
I'm putting Garner in command.
But he's an engineer, not a command officer.
He's the best they got.
Pegasus, Buster.
Dradis intercept training birds are away.
HOSHI:
Buster, Pegasus.
Roger that.
Take station as briefed.
Be advised communications will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar EMI activity, acknowledge.
BUSTER:
Pegasus, Buster.
Acknowledge.
Our communications suck.
It's gonna be like this all day?
Big time.
Those binaries are putting out so much EMI, even the dradis is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna put a little distance between us and the fleet.
Get us out of this soup, see if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Hey!
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go!
Come on!
Got a couple of tired Viper jockeys out here who want to sleep.
Go hit the showers, Duck.
We'll be gone by the time you get back.
(GROANING)
How you feel?
Oh, not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up, and it's been almost a month, so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly of The Beast?
The Beast?
Yeah.
That's what they call the Pegasus now.
Galactica's The Bucket.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
The Bucket and The Beast.
Huh.
Don't we make a pair?
Come on.
No, you come on.
Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you?
One word, Starbuck.
Is she in hack again?
(CHUCKLING)
Not yet.
But apparently she's been driving Commander Garner up one bulkhead and down the other ever since she took over flight training on, what did you call it?
The Beast.
And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I...
APOLLO:
Oh.
Were you gonna mention these?
Oh, yeah.
I got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy.
Doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Oh, well, if you say so, then it must be true.
(MOANING)
TYROL:
So what's going on?
We were unloading one of the containers and then one of the crates shifted.
So we looked inside and we saw that something was moving.
Did you call it in?
Yeah.
We shut the door and the Marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait?
Just wait out here.
Chief?
Is this the Galactica?
Yeah.
Are you Doctor Cottle?
(DISTORTED CHATTERING OVER RADIO)
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
We should call it in.
I'm gonna spin up the FTL drive just in case.
LYLA:
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
(DISTORTED CHATTERING OVER RADIO)
Say again, Shark.
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Buster, Shark, do you read?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
OFFICER:
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read?
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi?
Not sure, sir.
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, sir.
OFFICER 1:
I want us to recheck that.
OFFICER 2:
Okay, I need to check if we're getting some readouts on the problem.
Yeah?
All right, I'll check again.
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, sir.
Major Adama.
Commander Garner.
Glad to see you, Major, although I wish it was under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact with two of our Raptors out on a training mission.
What?
When did that happen?
Captain Thrace, perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring your Raptors, the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
Major.
You with me, Major?
Yes, sir.
They disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up!
We lose two Raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the Commander throws it in my face?
Don't all speak at once.
Sir, it's been made clear that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed.
Sorry, sir.
And whose frakking bright idea was that?
It was Garner, wasn't it?
STARBUCK:
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
Huh.
There's a hell of a combination.
I've a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I know how to handle her, sir.
And for the record, she is one hell of a Viper pilot.
What, I should cut her some slack because she's good in the cockpit, is that what you're saying?
Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
I can tell you that right now.
But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a Viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of our pants down there.
The engine room is like a finely-tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done in the proper way, at the proper time, in the proper order.
Or there'd be no power, no lights, no hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major, I think some of the people around here could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madam President, but it's that time.
Oh.
The campaign meeting.
Mmm-hmm.
You've been putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a presidential election coming up, unless you've decided not to run.
I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you, Tory.
I've thought about it a few times, but, no, I'm still here.
There's so much to do, so let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this?
I was precinct captain for the Federalist Party in Delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
Your presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and you've received enthusiastic endorsements from the Gemenese religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of leading this fleet?
Absolutely.
And for a time, I almost had a chance, until Laura Roslin ascended from politician to prophet.
The truth is, I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek, really, but I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics, as I find the vice-presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin would get old after a time, but it's the office that makes you the perfect candidate, Doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really?
To whom?
You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom?
You'll just step aside, will you?
I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
A man who remembers his friends.
CASE:
Attention on deck.
APOLLO:
At ease.
Where's Stinger?
He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
Stepped on his precious little toes.
Frakking Garner.
(ALL LAUGHING)
STARBUCK:
He's such an idiot.
He's just...
All right, lock that up!
Get something straight.
We got two missing Raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frakking jobs.
Now, we need to start thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything there is to know about these missing Raptors and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
Good.
Get to it.
How is she?
Rya's four months pregnant and doesn't wanna be.
I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what that's really all about?
Pretty straightforward, really.
I get a note that a girl is on the way, she arrives, I do my work, and she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little worried about you.
They've contacted me through the Gemenon representative.
My parents?
Oh, gods.
Do you have any idea what they would do to me?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway aboard a military ship.
COTTLE:
Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
Hell, she could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it.
I want asylum.
Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents, and they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest, I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
Sarah.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but my people, my voters, are demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under Colonial law before the attacks, and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods.
You cannot equivocate on this point if you want our support in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah, very much, for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
TORY:
Then don't.
But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
I'm gonna arrange a conference call with you and the Quorum, or this is gonna get out of hand, fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
(ADAMA SIGHS)
What?
I hate to say this
because I know that this is a political issue.
The fact is, that number doesn't go up very often.
I have fought for a woman's right to control her body my entire career.
No.
No.
I'm just remembering what you said right after the Cylon attack.
That if we really wanna save the human race, we better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where is Shark's last transmission?
Well, there's not much there.
"Eve, distress, bearing, wreck,
"shuns, emerge, read. "
They're in distress.
They give a bearing requesting instructions,
"It's an emergency.
Can you read?"
Maybe.
But what's this "eve" fragment here?
"Eve, distress. " "Eve, distress. "
(WHISPERING) Distress call.
Eve.
Receive...
Received.
Received distress call.
Okay.
From who?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where they went, to go find out.
APOLLO:
Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing Raptors, sir.
That's good, considering she lost them.
Excuse me?
Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions, weren't they, Captain?
My "so-called" training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny.
Commander, we should take this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship?
"Barely competent and paranoid. "
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialed.
Commander, I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behavior...
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters until I can ship you back to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major?
Sir.
You've been onboard less than four days and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate?
I'm here to do a job.
Yeah, keep a loudmouth, disobedient, frak-up Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job, are you?
Evidently not.
We don't have much time, those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried, all right?
All I have done since I got to The Beast is try and help, and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass!
All right.
Here we go, finally.
What is your problem, anyway?
What's my problem?
What's my problem?
Well, Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it?
You mean since I got shot?
You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster or not?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates where our Raptors went missing.
SHARK: (ON RADIO) Repeat, emer...
There are...
RED DEVIL:
Buster, is that you?
This is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.
SHARK: (ON RADIO) Out of power.
Oxygen almost out.
By the gods, help!
Sir, one of our search Raptors just picked a possible distress signal from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
A possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory?
Is this your theory, Major?
This is Captain Thrace's theory, is it not?
Mr. Thornton, can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from?
Yes, sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a Cylon trap, and...
And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we've finally got the break we've been looking for, a bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
The Cylons have been known to lure our ships into traps using fake distress calls.
Have you considered that?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.
We?
Major Adama, do you concur?
Sir,
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that the first two Raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, sir.
We'll send a recon mission in full force.
Five Raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections?
An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
So now it's our administration.
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother.
You needn't read the report.
If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be extinct.
ROSLIN: (ON PA) Since assuming the Presidency, I've made it my mission to maintain the rights and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
One of these rights has now come into direct conflict with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if this civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet.
Therefore, I am issuing an executive order.
From this day forward, anyone seeking to interfere with the birth of a child, whether it be the mother
or a medical practitioner, shall be subject to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
OFFICER: (ON PA SYSTEM) All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
CASE:
All right, come on.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Captain Case, what's going on?
We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump, we're gonna launch on the other side.
Get down to the hangar deck.
What?
Look, you're the best pilot we've got, so get down there, and find a Viper.
It's about time you admit that!
Commander, what's our sitrep?
This is a rescue mission, Major.
On whose authority?
Mine.
I'm bringing my pilots home.
All due respect, sir, but if this is a Cylon trap, then we are entering blind.
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying down there, Major.
I'm going in.
I'm not waiting on recon.
Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major, leave combat...
Making this an illegal action on your part, sir.
You are relieved, Major.
Sergeant of the Guard.
I am forced to take command of this vessel...
This man is in direct disobedience of an order under federal regulations and place you under arrest.
Sergeant, take him below.
Sergeant, the Commander has been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
Major, if you'll come with me.
Admiral, the Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put us clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two Raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi, tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and let's bring our people home.
Aye, sir.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
I can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to raise the Raptors on wireless.
Pegasus, both Raptor crews are dead.
I repeat, they're all dead.
(BEEPING)
Sir, three Cylon Baseships just jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my gods.
They're launching nukes!
Brace for impact!
(GROANING)
(ALARM BLARING)
(GLASS SHATTERING)
(CREW SHOUTING)
Damage report.
Two...
Two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir.
FTL drive inoperative, sir.
We're stuck here, sir.
All right, Showboat, you take Red Squadron, hit them on the right.
Catbird, you take Green, hit them on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Well, then the spinner's fine.
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just pull it.
Pull it!
(ALL SHOUTING)
Nuclear detonation.
There's structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
They can't take much more of this, how long before those drives are back up?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
(PILOT SPEAKING ON RADIO)
Yes, sir.
I have the con.
(ALARM BLARING)
Make for the nearest Baseship, and roll us over to keep our topside out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck and Case.
Tell them I've assumed command and to concentrate on protecting our topside.
Aye, sir.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact?
Negative, sir.
Give me this.
Can I get through there?
Baseship dead ahead.
We're closing rapidly.
We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
Helm, steady as you go.
Have the bow batteries stand by for salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
Yes, sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTLs fixed soon or we're dead.
(EXPLOSION)
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
Fire.
CREWMAN:
I wouldn't try it without a canteen, sir.
GARNER:
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
The pressure's dropping.
We've got a hull breach in there somewhere.
Well, we gotta get in there and open the auxiliary valve.
We can't do that, sir.
We have to!
Sir, that breach could vent all our oxygen into space!
We don't have a choice.
Now open the hatch!
(AIR WHOOSHING)
Breathing gear?
We used it all in fighting the fire, sir.
Give me a sledge and a number 12 spanner.
Okay.
Now, close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air.
Close the goddamn hatch!
Close it!
The Baseship's turning away.
He's...
He's frakking running, Major!
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm, left full.
(LAUGHING)
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
(PANTING)
(GRUNTING)
(GROANING)
There's definitely air escaping through a crack over the FCC relay.
Your breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports Vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
They're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
We've got to haul ass outta here now, sir.
Sir!
PILOT:
Watch yourself, starboard side!
Come on, Garner.
BELLAMY:
O2's in the red, Skipper.
You're almost out of air.
(ALARM BLARING)
You got it!
The pressure's coming back up!
Now get the frak outta there!
Come on!
Air's gone, Skipper.
Get out of there.
Skipper!
Engineering reporting a green board, FTL drive online and ready.
Okay, commence jump prep.
Bring our birds home.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Nobody behind me but toasters.
Now, get us out of here!
Air wing's back on board.
Launch bays secure.
Jump.
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective and I had mine.
In your opinion, off the record, what was Garner's flaw?
He was used to working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that as you take command of The Beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's my responsibility.
Don't let me fail a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madam President, word has it that you do not intend to prosecute the Gemenese girl on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
And I think that Rya has suffered enough.
She's just been through an abortion.
I've granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
This is in total violation of the law.
My order came after she sought her procedure.
No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home with her parents.
I insist.
You have your pound of flesh, and I suggest you take your victory and you move on.
Ma'am.
(SIGHING)
You realize you're screwed, right?
All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights.
All the officers giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay here and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings, 'cause the XO's a lot of fun the first thing.
Great.
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why I was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you would've been sufficient.
Because you were doing what you always did.
Buck authority and get away with it.
I bucked authority once, and I almost lost everything.
So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus and there you were, doing it all over again...
I don't know.
It pissed me off.
Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
You should hear the way my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay?
You have a brain?
(REPORTERS ASKING QUESTIONS)
Madam President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor.
Do you think that's hurt your standing in the polls?
Absolutely.
If I may, Madam President.
It is true, in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters.
I would ask the people to understand that, if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times.
The decision has been made with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good conscience support it.
I'm so sorry, Madam President, but the Cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom.
How could they?
They're programmed machines.
Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time we restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them.
As the Vice President, I am bound to follow the administration's lead.
As President,
I should have no such strictures.
Given the current situation, I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the Presidency.
(REPORTERS SHOUTING QUESTIONS)
Previously, on Battlestar Galactica
Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.
You have to really stay.
You must betray Roslin and run for president in the upcoming election.
I know it's hard, but it's the only way.
Word of Fisk's murder spread out to the entire fleet.
Crew can fall apart when their Commander is killed.
Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
I'm puting Garner in command.
But he's an engineer, not a command officer.
He's the best they've got.
Pegasus, Buster.
Dradis intercept training birds are away.
Buster, Pegasus, roger that, take station...
be advised... communications... will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar EMI activity.
Acknowledge ?
Pegasus, Buster, acknowledge.
Our communications suck .
Is it gonna be like this all day ?
- Big time.
Those binaries are putting out so much EMI, even the dradis is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna put a little distance between us and the fleet.
Get us out of the soup.
See if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Whoever's in there, time's up .
Let's go, come on .
Gotta a couple of tired Viper jockeys out here wanna sleep.
Go hit the showers Duck .
We'll be gone by the time you get back.
How you feel ?
Not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up... and it's been almost a month, so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly of the beast ?
The beast ?
- Yeah.
That's what they call the Pegasus now.
Galactica's the bucket.
The bucket and the beast.
Don't we make a pair ?
Come on.
No, you come on.
- Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you ?
One word.
Starbuck.
Is she in hack again ?
Not yet.
But apparently, she's been driving commander Garner up one bulkhead... and down the other ever since she took over flight training on--
What'd you call it ?
The beast ?
And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I--
Were you going to mention these ?
Oh, yeah.
Got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy .
It doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Well, if you say so, then it must be true.
What's going on ?
We were unloading one of the containers and one of the crates shifted.
So, we looked inside, and saw that something was moving.
Did you call it in ?
Yeah, we shut the door, and the marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait ?
Just wait out here.
Chief .
Is this the Galactica ?
Yeah.
Are you Dr. Cottle ?
... in distress...
What the hell was that ?
I don't know.
We should call it in.
I gonna spin up the FTL drive just in case.
Pegasus, this is Raptor 718.
Emergency... request...
Say again, Shark.
Eve... distress bearing... reek... shuns...
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency ?
Buster, Shark, do you read ?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency ?
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read ?
What have you got, Mr. Hoshi ?
- I'm not sure, Sir.
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, Sir.
Season 2
- Episode 17 The Captain's Hand
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighborhood.
Major Adama, Sir.
Major Adama.
Cdr.
Garner.
Glad to see you, Major.
Although I wish it was under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact with two of our Raptors out on a training mission.
What ?
When did that happen ?
Captain Thrace.
Perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring... your Raptors the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
Major ?
You with me, Major ?
Yes, Sir.
They disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up .
We lose two Raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the commander throws it in my face.
Don't all speak at once.
- Sir, it's been made clear... that discussing flight deck situations... with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed.
Sorry, Sir.
And whose frakkin'bright idea was that ?
It was Garner, wasn't it ?
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
There's a hell of a combination.
I have a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I know to handle her, Sir.
And for the record, she is one hell of a Viper pilot.
What ?
I should cut her some slack... because she's good in the cockpit, is that what you're saying ?
Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
I could tell you that right now.
But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a Viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of our pants down there .
The engine room is like a finely tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained... in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done in the proper way at the proper time in the proper order .
Or there'd be no power.
No lights.
No hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major, I think some of the people around here... could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madame President.
But it's that time.
Campaign meeting.
We've been putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a presidential election coming up... unless you've decided not to run.
Yeah and to be perfectly honest with you, I've thought about it a few times but...
No, I'm still here.
There's so much to do, so...
Let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this ?
I was Precinct Captain for the federalist party... in Delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the Mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
You're presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and you've received enthusiastic endorsements from the gemenese religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of leading this fleet ?
Absolutely.
And for a time,
I almost had a chance.
Until Laura Roslin ascended... from politician to prophet.
The truth is I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr. Zarek.
Really.
But I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics as I find... the vice presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin... would get old after a time, but it's the office... that makes you the perfect candidate, Doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really ?
To whom ?
You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances... of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings... of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom.
You'll just step aside, will you ?
I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
A man... who remembers his friends.
Attention on deck.
At ease.
Where's Stinger ?
- He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
He stepped on his precious little toes.
Fracking Garner.
He's such an idiot.
- All right, lock that up .
Get something straight.
We got two missing Raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So, everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frackin'jobs.
Now...
We need to start thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything about these missing Raptors and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
Good, get to it.
How is she ?
- Rya's four months pregnant... and doesn't want to be.
I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what that's really all about ?
Pretty straightforward, really.
I get a note that a girl's on the way, she arrives, I do my work and she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
- You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little worried about you.
They've contacted me through the gemenon representative.
My parents.
Gods...
Do you have any idea what they would do to me ?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway... aboard a military ship.
Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
Hell, she could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it.
I want asylum.
Under gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents... and they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest,
I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
Sarah.
- I know you don't want to hear this.
But my people, my voters are demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under colonial law... before the attacks and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The Scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the Gods.
You cannot equivocate on this point... if you want our support in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah, very much for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
Then don't.
But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
I'm gonna arrange a conference call, you and the Quorum... either this is gonna get out of hand fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
What ?
I hate to say this.
Because I know that this is a political issue.
The fact is that that number... doesn't go up very often.
I fought for a woman's right to control her body my entire career.
No...
No.
I'm just remembering what you said.
Right after the cylon attack.
That if we really want to save the human race, we'd better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where... is shark's last transmission ?
Well... there's not much there.
'Eve... distress... bearing... reek... shuns... emerge... read.'
They're in distress.
They give a bearing 'requesting instructions... it's an emergency... can you read'?
Maybe, but what's this 'eve' fragment here ?
Eve... distress.
Eve... distress.
Eve.
Recei-received ?
Received distress call.
Okay.
From who ?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where they went.
To go find out.
Commander,
Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing Raptors, Sir.
That's good considering she lost them.
Excuse me ?
They were out on one of your so-called training missions.
Werent't they ?
My 'so-called' training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny ?
Cdr. , we should take this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship ?
'Barely competent ?
And paranoid ?
'
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialled.
Commander.
I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behavior.
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters.
Until I can ship you back to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
Major ?
- Yes, Sir.
You've been on board less than four days, and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you ?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate ?
I'm here to do a job .
Yeah.
Keep a loudmouth, disobedient frak of Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job, are ya ?
- Evidently not.
We don't have much time.
Those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried.
All right ?
All I have done since I got to the beast is try and help, and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass .
All right.
Here we go.
Finally.
What is your problem anyway ?
What's my problem ?
What's my problem ?
Well Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially... sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it ?
You mean, since I got shot.
You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster, or not ?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates where our Raptors went missing.
Repeat, emer...
We are in dist...
Buster, is that you ?
Buster, this is Red Devil, man.
Is that you, buddy ?
Come back to me.
Power failure...
oxygen's almost out of the Gods, help...
Sir .
One of our search Raptor just picked up a possible distress signal... from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
Possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down... a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory ?
Is this your theory, Major ?
This is Captain Thrace's theory, is it not ?
Mr. Thornton.
Can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from ?
Yes, Sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive, and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, Sir.
Sir.
This isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a cylon trap, and--
- And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we finally got the break we've been looking for bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
But the Cylons have been known to lure ships into traps.
Using fake distressed calls.
Have you considered that ?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.
- We ?
Major Adama, do you concur ?
Sir...
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that... the first two Raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, Sir.
We'll send a recon mission in full force.
Five Raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, Sir.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Yes, Sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections ?
An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
So, now it's our administration ?
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago... when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all, and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother, you needn't read the report.
If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be... extinct.
Since assuming the presidency, I've made it my mission to maintain the rights... and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
one of these rights has now come into direct conflict... with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if the civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet.
Therefore, I'm issuing an executive order.
From this day forward, anyone seeking to interfere with a birth of child, whether it be the mother... or a medical practitioner... shall be subject to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
All right, come on, let's go, let's go .
Captain Case, what's going on ?
We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump.
We're gonna launch on the other side.
Get down to the hangar deck .
- What ?
Look.
You're the best pilot we've got.
So, get down there.
Find a Viper.
It's about time you admitted that .
Cdr. , what's our sitrep ?
- This is a rescue mission, Major.
On whose authority ?
- Mine.
I'm bringing my pilots home.
With all due respect, Sir, but if this is a cylon trap, then we are entering blind.
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying down there, Major .
I'm going in, I'm not waiting on recon .
This is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major.
Leave combat.
- Making this an illegal action... on your part, Sir .
- You are relieved, Major .
I am forced to take command of this vessel .
Under federal regulations, I place you under arrest .
Sergeant.
Take him below.
Sergeant, the Commander's been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey... a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
Major.
You'll come with me.
Admiral .
The Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put is clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two Raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr. Hoshi.
Tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and let's bring our people home.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
Can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to raise the Raptors on wireless.
Pegasus, both Raptor crews are dead.
I repeat.
They're all dead.
Sir, three cylon base ships just jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my Gods.
They're launching nukes .
Brace for impact.
Damage report ?
Two nuclear detonations in the stern, Sir.
FTL drive inoperative, Sir.
- We're stuck here, Sir.
All right, Showboat.
You take Red Squadron.
Hit'em on the right.
Catbird, you take Green.
Hit'em on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Then the spinner's fine ?
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no, listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just pull it, pull it .
Nuclear detonation.
We have structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
We can't take much more of this.
How long before those drives are back up ?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
Yes, Sir.
I have the con.
Make for the nearest base ship.
And roll us over to keep our top side out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck and Case.
Tell them I've assumed command.
and to concentrate on protecting our top side.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr. Gaeta, any contact ?
Negative, Sir.
Base ship dead ahead, we're closing rapidly .
We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
Helm.
Steady as you go.
Have the bow battery stand by for a salvo fire.
Target their center axis.
- Yes, Sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTIs fixed soon.
Or we're dead.
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
Fire.
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
Pressure's dropping.
We gotta hull breach in there somewhere.
We gotta get in there, and open the auxiliary valve .
We can't do that, sir .
- We have to .
Sir, that breach can vent all our oxygen into space.
We don't have a choice.
Now, open the hatch.
Breathing gear ?
We used it all up fighting the fires, Sir.
Give me sledge... and a number 12 spanner.
OK.
Now close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air, close the Gods damn hatch.
Close it .
Base ship's turning away.
He's fracking running, Major .
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm .
Left, full .
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
Yes .
There's definitely air escaping.
Through a crack over the SVC relay.
The breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports Vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
We're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
We gotta haul ass outta here now, Sir .
Sir .
Come on, Garner.
O2's in the red, skipper.
You're almost out of air.
You got it .
The pressure's coming back up.
Now get the frack outta there, come on .
Air is gone, skipper, get outta there .
Skipper ?
Engineering's reporting a green board.
FTL drive online and ready.
Okay, commence jump prep.
Bring our birds home.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Nobody behind me but toasters.
Now get us outta here .
- Air wing's back on board.
Landing bays secure.
Jump .
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective.
And I had mine.
In your opinion, off the record...
What was Garner's flaw ?
He was used to working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that.
As you take command... of the beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's my responsibility.
Don't let me fail a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madame President.
Word has it that you do not intend... to prosecute the gemenese girl on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
I think that Rya has suffered enough.
She's just been through an abortion.
I've granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
This is in total violation of the law.
My order came after she sought her procedure.
No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home, with her parents.
I insist.
You have your pound of flesh.
And I suggest you take your victory and you move on.
Ma'am...
You realize you're screwed, right ?
All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights, all the officers giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay here and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings.
'Cause the XO's a lot of fun first thing.
Great...
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why I was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you would have been sufficient.
'Cause you were doing what you always did.
Buck authority, and get away with it.
I bucked authority once.
And I almost lost everything.
So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus and there you were... doing it all over again.
I don't know.
Pissed me off.
Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it ?
You should hear the way my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay ?
You have a brain ?
Madame President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furor.
Do you think that's hurt your standing in the polls ?
Absolutely.
- If I may, Madame President.
It is true in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters.
I would ask the people to understand that if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times.
The decision has been made with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good conscience support it.
I am so sorry, Madame President.
But the Cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom.
How could they ?
They're programmed.
Machines...
Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time you restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them.
As the Vice President,
I am bound to follow the administration's lead.
As President...
I should have no such strictures.
Given the current situation,
I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the presidency.
Previously on Battlestar Galactica.
Lee, you can't leave.
You have to stay.
You have to really stay.
You must betray Roslin and run for President in the upcoming election.
I know it's hard, but it's the only way.
Word of Fisk's murder has spread out through the entire fleet.
A crew can fall apart when their commander is killed.
The Pegasus lost two in a matter of weeks.
I'm putting Garner in command.
But he's an engineer, not a command officer.
He's the best they got.
Pegasus, Buster.
Dradis intercept training birds are away.
Buster, Pegasus.
Roger that.
Take station as briefed.
Be advised communications will suffer sporadic interruptions due to stellar emi activity, acknowledge.
Pegasus, Buster.
Acknowledge.
Our communications suck.
It's gonna be like this all day?
Big time.
Those binaries are putting out so much emi, even the dradis is barely working.
Well, I'm gonna put a little distance between us and the fleet.
Get us out of this soup, see if we can get a cleaner dradis picture.
Hey!
Whoever's in there, time's up!
Let's go!
Come on!
Got a couple of tired Viper jockeys out here who want to sleep.
Go hit the showers, Duck.
We'll be gone by the time you get back.
How you feel?
Oh, not great.
But Cottle's given me the thumbs-up, and it's been almost a month, so I guess it's back to work.
So you ready to go into the belly of The Beast?
-The Beast?
-Yeah.
That's what they call the Pegasus now.
Galactica's The Bucket.
The Bucket and The Beast.
Huh.
Don't we make a pair?
-Come on.
-No, you come on.
Come on, come on, go.
Anyway, it's only a temporary assignment.
I should be back again in a couple of weeks.
Why'd the old man pick you?
One word, Starbuck.
is she in hack again?
Not yet.
But apparently she's been driving Commander Garner up one bulkhead and down the other ever since she took over flight training on, what did you call it?
The Beast.
And since I won't be flying combat for a while, I...
Oh.
Were you gonna mention these?
Oh, yeah.
I got promoted to Major.
Well, don't sound so happy.
Doesn't mean much.
I think it means a lot.
Oh, well, if you say so, then it must be true.
So what's going on?
We were unloading one of the containers and then one of the crates shifted.
So we looked inside and we saw that something was moving.
Did you call it in?
Yeah.
We shut the door and the Marines are on their way.
Give me a light.
Chief, we don't know what we're dealing with here.
Don't you think we should wait?
Just wait out here.
Chief?
is this the Galactica?
Yeah.
Are you Doctor Cottle?
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
We should call it in.
I'm gonna spin up the FTL drive just in case.
Pegasus, this is Raptor 7 18.
Say again, Shark.
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Buster, Shark, do you read?
Shark, repeat your last.
Did you declare an emergency?
Commander Garner on deck.
Buster, Shark, do you read?
What have you got, Mr Hoshi?
Not sure, sir.
I think Buster and Shark are declaring an emergency, but their transmission's garbled.
We've lost them, sir.
I want us to recheck that.
Okay, I need to check if we're getting some readouts on the problem.
Yeah?
All right, I'll check again.
Welcome aboard, Major.
I didn't expect a welcoming committee.
Don't flatter yourself.
I was in the neighbourhood.
Major Adama, sir.
Major Adama.
Commander Garner.
Glad to see you, Major, although I wish it was under better circumstances.
We have just lost contact with two of our Raptors out on a training mission.
What?
When did that happen?
Captain Thrace, perhaps if you were actually down on the flight deck and monitoring your Raptors, the way any training officer worth a damn would have done, you would know that four of our pilots were missing.
Major.
You with me, Major?
Yes, sir.
They disappeared from the dradis about an hour ago.
They're gone.
Shut the hell up!
We lose two Raptors in a training mission, and I only find out when the Commander throws it in my face?
Don't all speak at once.
Sir, it's been made clear that discussing flight deck situations with anyone outside Pegasus crew is not allowed.
Sorry, sir.
And whose frakking bright idea was that?
It was Garner, wasn't it?
Of course it was.
So barely competent and paranoid.
Huh.
There's a hell of a combination.
I've a problem.
That problem's name is Kara Thrace.
I know how to handle her, sir.
And for the record, she is one hell of a Viper pilot.
What, I should cut her some slack because she's good in the cockpit, is that what you're saying?
Because nobody ever cut us any slack in the engine room.
I can tell you that right now.
But then, I don't know, maybe being a snipe is different than being a Viper jockey.
No flashy stunts for us.
No flying by the seat of our pants down there.
The engine room is like a finely-tuned watch, and everything in it needs to be monitored and maintained in a very precise fashion.
Nobody freelances.
Everything is done in the proper way, at the proper time, in the proper order.
Or there'd be no power, no lights, no hot showers for your flyboys.
You know, Major, I think some of the people around here could learn a thing or two from the snipes.
I'm sorry, Madam President, but it's that time.
Oh.
The campaign meeting.
Mmm-hmm.
You've been putting it off for weeks.
And we do have a presidential election coming up, unless you've decided not to run.
I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you, Tory.
I've thought about it a few times, but, no, I'm still here.
There's so much to do, so let's talk politics.
Great.
Here are the results from our first fleet-wide poll.
How did you manage this?
I was precinct captain for the Federalist Party in Delphi for five years.
We did polls to see what the mayor should have for lunch.
For what it's worth, you've managed to walk a very fine line.
Your presidential bid has the support of both the military and the civilian fleet, and you've received enthusiastic endorsements from the Gemenese religious leaders.
Well, it helps when your only real rival is a convicted terrorist.
Am I capable of leading this fleet?
Absolutely.
And for a time, I almost had a chance, until Laura Roslin ascended from politician to prophet.
The truth is, I can't win.
But you could.
You flatter me, Mr Zarek, really, but I'm not sure I'm cut out for a life in politics, as I find the vice-presidency and everything to do with it very tedious.
I would imagine carrying water for Roslin would get old after a time, but it's the office that makes you the perfect candidate, Doctor.
You're pre-sold.
Really?
To whom?
You'd be surprised how many people crave the assurances of cold science as opposed to the superstitious ravings of the Gemenese.
As a scientist, you offer hope.
Think about it.
And you, Tom?
You'll just step aside, will you?
I'm just happy to back a man of true conviction.
A man who remembers his friends.
Attention on deck.
At ease.
Where's Stinger?
He's in hack for mouthing off to Garner.
Stepped on his precious little toes.
Frakking Garner.
He's such an idiot.
He's just...
All right, lock that up!
Get something straight.
We got two missing Raptor crews who are gonna be out of oxygen in 36 hours.
That's all that matters.
So everyone knock off the schoolyard crap and start doing your frakking jobs.
Now, we need to start thinking outside the box.
Which is supposed to be what you do best.
Sorry, Major.
All right.
I wanna know everything there is to know about these missing Raptors and their crews.
I wanna know personal quirks, aircraft squawks, wireless transmissions, anything that might help.
Good.
Get to it.
How is she?
Rya's four months pregnant and doesn't wanna be.
I understand the Gemenese have a problem with women terminating their pregnancies.
Tyrol said that she asked for you by name.
Do you want to tell me what that's really all about?
Pretty straightforward, really.
I get a note that a girl is on the way, she arrives, I do my work, and she leaves.
I don't ask a lot of questions.
You're gonna start.
I wanna talk to her.
I'm Admiral Adama.
Don't worry, I've just come to talk.
It doesn't matter what you say.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Your parents are a little worried about you.
They've contacted me through the Gemenon representative.
My parents?
Oh, gods.
Do you have any idea what they would do to me?
Please, do not send me back.
You're a stowaway aboard a military ship.
Some people might say she was a victim of political persecution.
Hell, she could apply for asylum.
Asylum.
That's it. I want asylum.
Under Gemenon law, the girl is still the property of her parents, and they can deal with her once she's safely back on her ship.
To be honest, I'm more concerned with the broader implications of this matter.
Sarah.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but my people, my voters, are demanding action on this issue.
We have been through this.
Abortion was legal under Colonial law before the attacks, and so it is still legal today.
It's obscene.
The scriptures view abortion as an abomination in the eyes of the gods.
You cannot equivocate on this point if you want our support in the coming election.
Rya Kibby's petition for asylum is under review.
Thank you, Sarah, very much, for coming in.
I'm not turning that girl over.
I'm certainly not banning abortion.
Then don't.
But we have to move aggressively on this thing.
I'm gonna arrange a conference call with you and the Quorum, or this is gonna get out of hand, fast.
She's not Billy.
No, she's not.
What?
I hate to say this
because I know that this is a political issue.
The fact is, that number doesn't go up very often.
I have fought for a woman's right to control her body my entire career.
No.
No.
I'm just remembering what you said right after the Cylon attack.
That if we really wanna save the human race, we better start having babies.
Nothing, nothing, and more nothing.
Where is Shark's last transmission?
Well, there's not much there.
"Eve, distress, bearing, reek,
"shuns, emerge, read?"
They're in distress.
They give a bearing requesting instructions,
"lt's an emergency.
Can you read?"
Maybe.
But what's this "eve" fragment here?
"Eve, distress." "Eve, distress."
Distress call.
Eve.
Receive...
Received.
Received distress call.
Okay.
From who?
I don't know.
But maybe that's where they went, to go find out.
Commander, Captain Thrace has a theory about our missing Raptors, sir.
That's good, considering she lost them.
Excuse me?
Well, they were out on one of your so-called training missions, weren't they, Captain?
My "so-called" training missions.
Okay, let's just take this easy.
That's when you're not boozing or sowing mutiny amongst the crew.
Mutiny.
Commander, we should take this to a private place.
Don't you think I know what's happening on my own ship?
"Barely competent and paranoid."
That was off the record.
I was just venting.
Accurately.
I'll have you court-martialed.
Commander, I'm not defending Captain Thrace's behaviour...
Thanks, Major.
Captain Thrace, you're restricted to quarters until I can ship you back to Galactica.
You're Adama's pet.
Let him deal with you.
-Major?
-Sir.
You've been onboard less than four days and you're already facing charges.
You don't waste any time, do you?
Neither do you, Lee.
How's it feel being Garner's new playmate?
I'm here to do a job.
Yeah, keep a loudmouth, disobedient, frak-up Kara Thrace in line.
Not doing such a good job, are you?
Evidently not.
We don't have much time, those guys are running out of air.
Yeah, well, I tried, all right?
All I have done since I got to The Beast is try and help, and all I've gotten is Garner's foot in my ass.
Well, maybe you need a kick in the ass!
All right.
Here we go, finally.
What is your problem, anyway?
What's my problem?
What's my problem?
Well, Kara, my problem is you.
You keep frakking up, and I keep having to clean it up, and I am officially sick of it.
Poor Lee, your life is so hard, isn't it?
You mean since I got shot?
You wanna hear what I think happened to Buster or not?
Pegasus, Red Devil.
I'm nearing the last coordinates where our Raptors went missing.
Repeat, emer...
There are...
Buster, is that you?
This is Red Devil, man.
is that you, buddy?
Come back to me.
Out of power.
Oxygen almost out.
By the gods, help!
Sir, one of our search Raptors just picked a possible distress signal from near where Pegasus lost communications with Buster's ship.
Finally.
A possible distress signal.
There's a theory that Buster himself might have jumped away to run down a phony distress call.
It could be a trap.
A theory?
is this your theory, Major?
This is Captain Thrace's theory, is it not?
Mr Thornton, can you give us a fix on where this distress signal is coming from.
Yes, sir, it's long range, over 40 SU away.
Then spin up the FTL drive and prepare to jump the ship.
Yes, sir.
Sir, this isn't just Captain Thrace's theory.
I think this is a Cylon trap, and...
And I disagree.
Now get Admiral Adama on the line.
I'm going to get our men.
Admiral, we've finally got the break we've been looking for, a bearing on the distress signal.
I can jump there inside of two minutes.
Commander, believe me, I understand how you feel.
The Cylons have been known to lure our ships into traps using fake distress calls.
Have you considered that?
We have, sir.
It's a scenario we don't think likely.
We?
Major Adama, do you concur?
Sir,
Captain Thrace and I are of the opinion that the first two Raptors may very well have been lured away by just such a trick.
An opinion I do not share, sir.
We'll send a recon mission in full force.
Five Raptors.
Three escort, two rescue.
You have your orders, Commander.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Major.
I'm sure your expertise is needed elsewhere.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am curious.
Why the sudden interest in the fleet's demographic projections?
An issue has emerged that may prove divisive to our administration.
I would like all the facts in hand before making my decision.
So now it's our administration.
She must be desperate.
Well, I'm a very busy man.
Luckily, I made an initial calculation on these figures over seven months ago when nobody seemed interested or concerned.
All I had to do was factor in the numbers from the Pegasus crew.
It took me hardly any time at all and I didn't mind.
Look, I'll save you the bother.
You needn't read the report.
If we continue on our present course, within the next 18 years, the human race will simply be extinct.
Since assuming the Presidency,
I've made it my mission to maintain the rights and freedoms we so enjoyed prior to the attack.
One of these rights has now come into direct conflict with the survival of the species.
And I find myself forced to make a very difficult decision.
The issue is stark.
The fact is that if this civilization is to survive, we must, must repopulate this fleet.

or a medical practitioner, shall be subject to criminal penalty.
Thank you.
All flight deck personnel, please report to stations.
All right, come on.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Captain Case, what's going on?
We've been ordered to scramble, condition one.
Ship's getting ready to jump, we're gonna launch on the other side.
Get down to the hangar deck.
What?
Look, you're the best pilot we've got, so get down there, and find a Viper.
It's about time you admit that!
Commander, what's our sitrep?
This is a rescue mission, Major.
On whose authority?
Mine. I'm bringing my pilots home.
All due respect, sir, but if this is a Cylon trap, then we are entering blind.
We should send a force recon...
My pilots are dying down there, Major.
I'm going in. I'm not waiting on recon.
Commander, this is in direct violation of the Admiral's orders.
Major, leave combat...
Making this an illegal action on your part, sir.
You are relieved, Major.
Sergeant of the Guard.
I am forced to take command of this vessel...
This man is in direct disobedience of an order under federal regulations and place you under arrest.
Sergeant, take him below.
Sergeant, the Commander has been properly relieved.
Escort him to his quarters.
This man is not a member of this crew, and you will obey a direct order that you have been given by me, and you will do it now.
Major, if you'll come with me.
Admiral, the Pegasus has jumped.
They're gone.
Dradis signal's clean.
Jump put us clear of any interference.
Sir, I show two Raptors.
Transponder codes match.
They're ours.
Mr Hoshi, tell the CAG to launch our recovery team, and let's bring our people home.
Aye, sir.
Pegasus, Red Devil.
Our two birds look intact.
I can't quite see inside yet.
Commander, we're unable to raise the Raptors on wireless.
Pegasus, both Raptor crews are dead.
I repeat, they're all dead.
Sir, three Cylon Baseships just jumped into weapons range.
Oh, my gods.
They're launching nukes!
Brace for impact!
Damage report.
Two...
Two nuclear detonations in the stern, sir.
FTL drive inoperative, sir.
We're stuck here, sir.
All right, Showboat, you take Red Squadron, hit them on the right.
Catbird, you take Green, hit them on the left.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're going straight up the gut.
Sergeant, I think you have better things to do.
Well, then the spinner's fine.
It's gotta be a sensor.
Just pull it.
No, no.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Just pull it.
Pull it!
Nuclear detonation.
There's structural damage along the topside heat exchanger.
They can't take much more of this, how long before those drives are back up?
I don't know.
They don't seem to understand.
I need to go down there.
You have the con.
Yes, sir.
I have the con.
Make for the nearest Baseship, and roll us over to keep our topside out of their line of fire.
Hoshi, contact Starbuck and Case.
Tell them I've assumed command and to concentrate on protecting our topside.
Aye, sir.
Wilco, Pegasus.
We got your back.
Mr Gaeta, any contact?
Negative, sir.
Give me this.
Can I get through there?
Baseship dead ahead.
We're closing rapidly.
We can't keep taking hits like this, Major.
Helm, steady as you go.
Have the bow batteries stand by for salvo fire.
Target their centre axis.
Yes, sir.
See if we can't cut down the odds.
We need those FTLs fixed soon or we're dead.
Twenty-two hundred.
Main battery has a firing solution.
Fire.
I wouldn't try it without a canteen, sir.
Coolant pressure's off-scale low.
Primary inlet's choked.
The pressure's dropping.
We've got a hull breach in there somewhere.
Well, we gotta get in there and open the auxiliary valve.
We can't do that, sir.
We have to!
Sir, that breach could vent all our oxygen into space!
We don't have a choice.
Now open the hatch!
Breathing gear?
We used it all in fighting the fire, sir.
Give me a sledge and a number 1 2 spanner.
Okay.
Now, close this hatch behind me.
We're losing air.
Close the goddamn hatch!
Close it!
The Baseship's turning away.
He's...
He's frakking running, Major!
But the other two aren't.
They're coming hard.
Helm, left full.
I'm at the manifold.
I'm gonna see if I can turn them.
There's definitely air escaping through a crack over the FCC relay.
Your breach is behind that.
Starbuck reports Vipers are skosh ammo, Major.
They're down to throwing rocks at the bastards.
We've got to haul ass outta here now, sir.
Sir!
pilot:
Watch yourself, starboard side!
Come on, Garner.
O2's in the red, Skipper.
You're almost out of air.
You got it!
The pressure's coming back up!
Now get the frak outta there!
Come on!
Air's gone, Skipper.
Get out of there.
Skipper!
Engineering reporting a green board, FTL drive online and ready.
Okay, commence jump prep.
Bring our birds home.
Pegasus, Starbuck.
Nobody behind me but toasters.
Now, get us out of here!
Air wing's back on board.
Launch bays secure.
Jump.
You give Garner a lot of credit.
Well, it's all true.
He gave his life to save the ship.
Starbuck's report wasn't so kind.
Well, she had her perspective and I had mine.
In your opinion, off the record, what was Garner's flaw?
He was used to working with machines.
Command is about people.
Remember that as you take command of The Beast.
Garner was my decision.
His failure's my responsibility.
Don't let me fail a second time.
Congratulations, Commander.
Madam President, word has it that you do not intend to prosecute the Gemenese girl on Galactica.
She has a name, Sarah.
And I think that Rya has suffered enough.
She's just been through an abortion.
I've granted her asylum aboard Galactica.
This is in total violation of the law.
My order came after she sought her procedure.
No laws have been broken.
The girl belongs at home with her parents.
I insist.
You have your pound of flesh, and I suggest you take your victory and you move on.
Ma'am.
You realise you're screwed, right?
All the pressure, the responsibility, the sleepless nights.
All the officers giving you a hard time.
Yeah, well, it could be worse.
You could be my CAG.
I'm gonna stay here and be Galactica's CAG.
Something about wanting to keep an eye on me.
Well, you and Colonel Tigh have a lot of fun at those early morning briefings, cause the XO's a lot of fun the first thing.
Great.
Congratulations.
Really.
Congratulations.
You deserve it.
I know why I was mad at you, Kara.
A simple thank you would've been sufficient.
Because you were doing what you always did.
Buck authority and get away with it.
I bucked authority once, and I almost lost everything.
So I guess when I showed up on Pegasus and there you were, doing it all over again... I don't know.
It pissed me off.
Doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
You should hear the way my brain works sometimes.
Are we okay?
You have a brain?
Madam President, your decision to criminalize abortion has created a furore.
Do you think that's hurt your standing in the polls?
Absolutely.
If I may, Madam President.
It is true, in the light of recent events, the President may have lost support in some quarters.
I would ask the people to understand that, if this is an extreme decision, we live in extreme times.
The decision has been made with good faith.
I, however, cannot with good conscience support it.
I'm so sorry, Madam President, but the Cylon have no understanding of the meaning of the word freedom.
How could they?
They're programmed machines.
Every time you take away one of our freedoms, every time we restrict or curtail one of our rights, we become one step closer to being like them.
As the Vice President, I am bound to follow the administration's lead.
As President, I should have no such strictures.
Given the current situation, I'm afraid that I have no alternative but to announce that I am, as of now, a candidate for the Presidency.
"Diary of a Thin Man."
- Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.
The devotion that kid shows.
I just think of my Marie, the kids, in that situation, God forbid.
My ma-- who the fuck would take care of her something happens?
Except Sil and you guys.
Colombians knock off at noon.
Then it's empty.
Manager's unit's down a flight.
- Who's in there?
- Open it.
What the fuck?
Get back!
- Shoot the prick.
- Get the fuck out of the way.
Cocksucking miserable Spic shit!
It's supposed to be empty here daytimes.
Jesus, my fucking balls!
The money!
Fuck, my fucking balls.
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.
Nothing.
Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.
Fuck that.
Close the goddamn door.
This fucking shit for a lousy two Gs?
Oh, Anthony.
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
Cugin'.
I'm gonna go ahead.
What's up?
You were at South Mountain Arena yesterday trying to buy a gun from that asshole in the snack shop.
Who told you that?
We know how you feel, but you can't do this.
I can't believe you know this.
Who told you this?
Look, if my pops was laying in there shot up
- I'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.
- Yeah, why the fuck not?
- Listen to me,
I'm your uncle.
Junior's in federal lockup.
No one's getting to him there.
Well, it's difficult, but not impossible.
Trust me.
Your dad does not want you to get involved.
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.
Fuck your girlfriend more.
You little hothead here.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Did you park in emergency or in the garage?
What's going on in there?
They're on rounds or something, Dr. Plepler and the Indian girl.
Hi, did you bring me my sweater?
Your sweater?
Man, Jesus, fuck!
All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?
My problem is I'm old enough to sit with Dad all night, be a messenger boy, bring shit from the house, but I'm too young to deal with the larger issues?
- What are you talking about?
- Like you didn't put them up to it.
Put who up to what?
God, he was in such a good mood this morning.
I told the nurse that I thought he moved his eyebrows at around 5:30.
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna be furious.
Mrs. Soprano, you're really gonna have to recalibrate your expectations at this point.
We can't even maintain his blood pressure at a level that we'd like.
Until his fever dissipates and his white cell count comes down, we're a long way from home.
But he's really fighting.
Mom, he's really strong.
That is true.
Hi, Dad.
Monastery?
Oh!
I, uh...
I received these this morning.
Do I really look that much like this guy?
To a certain extent, all Caucasians look alike.
Look, I'm not Finnerty.
I didn't sell you this heating equipment.
But I am kind of worried about what I might have done.
Because you see, yesterday--
Yes, tell us, there's no fraud without a fairy tale.
Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Oh, my.
And I'm in this strange city and--
Please come inside.
I came here because I thought you could help me reach Finnerty.
I have his wallet.
I have his briefcase, but I'm not him.
Excuse the brothers for laughing.
One day we will all die, and then we'll be the same as that tree.
No me, no you.
Be that as it may, we need heat.
We need to find someone who will take responsibility.
Well, I can't do that.
Then the lawsuit proceeds.
Hey, go home and I'll stay.
I just had Chinese food.
- Carmela?
- Dr. Melfi, hi.
How are you?
How are you is more the point.
I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee, or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing I have to have.
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.
I've been calling the hospital and they say that Anthony's stabilized.
That's what they say.
If you or anyone needs anything, to talk or to run interference with the doctors,
- don't hesitate to call.
- I appreciate that.
Thank you.
I have plenty of people around I can talk to.
Of course.
Good luck.
- Morning, Gab.
Is he ready?
- He's eating.
We're picking up Mrs. S. at 10:00.
I saw her Tuesday.
How's she holding up, poor thing?
Not so hotso, really.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
You hear about the thing in the old neighborhood?
I'm not busy enough for all this?
Couple of guys left three on the floor in some Colombian laundry.
Thank you.
Two guys we know, huh?
Total bloodbath.
Somebody said a million plus.
What a score.
Fuckin' A.
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.
Listen, don't forget...
Oh, honey, your asthma kicking up?
Springtime.
Pollen's out of control.
- I am so proud of you.
- Acting boss.
I hoped the day would never come.
You've always sold yourself short.
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.
All I ever wanted was to carve out a little piece, enjoy some grandkids.
But how many guys could step into Tony's shoes
- and do the job you're doing?
- You think?
You have such strength in crisis.
Benny told me he feels honored to drive you.
You're firm about what you want without being obnoxious about it.
Sil, have you asked yourself what happens if, God forbid, Tony Soprano doesn't recover?
Listen, Gab, I never talk to you about my work.
And?
I'm gonna tell you something I never told anybody.
Back when Jackie was at the end, he floated the idea of me stepping up to the big seat.
Not Tony, me.
- Really?
- Yeah, but I thought...
- it's not for me.
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it.
I never saw myself as that kind of guy.
I'm more behind the scenes-- advice, strategy.
But here you are, Sil.
The times make the man, honey, not the other way around.
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary--
No change with Tony.
Carmela's in goddamn pieces.
Memo-- get some coffee up to Carmela's house.
Sil, Bobby was making collections up in Roseville again last night.
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.
You forget something, like my cut?
You believe this guy?
You should've lost some weight in that nose, keep it out of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.
It's these fucking flowers right here.
Get this shit out of here.
That was Junior's neighborhood, so now it's mine.
Keep your voice down here.
A va' Napoli-- it was Eugene's going on three years.
And Eugene was with me.
You should have never had it to begin with, except for the beef with the Tastee Freez route.
Junior ruled on it, and it wasn't right then.
This fucking guy.
Easy.
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.
Maybe that's what that miserab' admitted to you.
- I heard five.
- You heard wrong.
What do we do here, Sil?
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?
For the time being, it's Bobby's.
But he's still gonna kick up to you 20%.
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah, Sil.
What, do you speak Norwegian?
For now.
We'll see how much is there.
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.
Hey, we just need some Irish Spring.
Good morning.
Another one?
Know what I found out yesterday?
What's that?
Thank you.
I was diagnosed actually... with Alzheimer's.
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
My uncle has memory loss.
Maybe it's hereditary.
Someone's probably studying that.
Is it possible that I am Kevin Finnerty?
All right, I'll stop.
- Sil.
- What?
You heard about this Orange Street takedown?
The Colombians?
That you?
My guy had the tip.
Should be a nice chunk for everybody.
Everybody?
Carmela, she gets T's cut under the circumstances, correct?
It's your call.
I know it's my fucking call.
Yes, that is the correct thing.
Oh, ladies' room's next door.
I can reach it from here.
Grim fucking scene, that icu.
She's one brave lady.
I was just saying, I'm gonna get T's piece of my half to Sil for her.
- Of the thing.
- Back up there, Bluto.
Your half?
I did all the heavy lifting.
You would never have heard about it without my information.
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.
You said the place was empty.
Doc says I need an ultrasound on my groin and balls.
Sil, you wanna weigh in here?
It breaks half and half.
You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.
I'll have it for you, Sil, the whole 80K.
Ho, ho, ho, 80K?
How's that 20% of a million?
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.
Fuck it all, Paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.
What's with the fucking accounting out there?
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?
We're looking after Carmela.
- No question.
- Of course.
Sooner than later, Paulie.
I gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?
In a prior incarnation, I would get my load on, blow 20 residuals at the track.
As writers, we are all hung up.
But we are also hung up on our own hang-up.
We mythologize our inner narrative.
Take for example, "Beowulf."
Who is Grendel, but the habit, the disease.
Ah, fresh casualties in the battle of the blank page.
Welcome to the Writer's Guild.
Have a seat.
Take me... my past as an addict.
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Give me that fucking fisheye.
I'm offering you a way to wipe your fucking obligation.
Wasn't me who told you to start gambling again.
I can't write a feature now.
I just landed a staff job.
People are seeing huge profits with these digital horror movies.
Douchebags who never made a film before.
That "Saw" thing, 400 grand to make, took in 100 mil worldwide.
I'm 100% well.
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?
You hear this dude?
100% well.
He's a bad boy, huh, with that lingo?
Real fucking dark character.
My idea is "Saw" meets "Godfather 2."
Proven track record-- both genres.
Young wiseguy, assassin, gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him,
leave his body parts in dumpsters all around the city.
Long story short, he is put back together by science, or maybe it's supernatural.
And he gets fucking payback on everyone who fucked him over, including the cunt he was engaged to.
She was getting porked by his boss the night the hero was killed.
We'll have a meeting tomorrow.
We hear what you've fleshed out before we go to script.
Bing, 2:30.
Don't make me come look for you.
An entire room full of writers, and you did nothing!
Sir, it's family only in the unit.
I'll be out of your hair in a minute, sister.
I keep telling you people, I'm gonna have to call the hospital administrator.
I wanted to let you know there's a major package coming your way from Paulie and Vito, very significant.
You all have done so much already.
We just found out insurance won't pay for physical therapy.
Bastards.
So thank you.
You wanna come in, say hello?
Uh, sure.
- Hello, Father.
- Silvio.
I have Napoleons, but I also got fruit for a certain party.
Either's good.
The program says sugar after meals
- tells the body you're full.
- When you married my cousin, everybody used to say you looked like John Travolta.
He's almost back to his white suit.
The Bacala question.
Bobby don't have any claim.
I don't know why Sil ruled so half-assed on you.
It's not my style.
He's worried more about taking care of Carmela
- than the actual fucking earners.
- Please.
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds freezing his assets, who do you think's keeping Ginny in butter brickle?
Lucky for me, those last years I was in the can, my kid brother Billy took care of Patty and the grandkids.
Only to have that motherfucking animal Blundetto--
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.
It's hard to forget.
I don't forget.
I forget what we were talking about.
Me too.
What the fuck was it?
Oh, yeah, Jesus.
Carmela.
The thing is--
You want coffee, coz?
If you're already making it.
Hot water and lemon, hon.
Honestly... how can I short Carmela?
Maybe I'm not following you.
I'm as supportive as the next guy, but there's a point.
And what if Tony takes a turn for the worse?
I'm gonna hand her $100,000, and he dies the next day?
Be money down the drain.
It's tempting, but you can't think that way.
You all set now?
Yeah, I'm living it up here.
You still stewing about that money?
Spend some, you'll get over it.
I'll never get over it.
Certain people-- let me tell you.
Oh, come on, not Sil again.
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.
But I still gotta pay tribute to the princess of Little Italy.
- The boss' wife.
What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.
I'm on my way in now.
Yeah, good, and you might want to take care of that thing we talked about.
Which thing?
That big piece of pie you were bringing to the hospital
She's expecting you, so make it happen.
What are you worried about?
I think I know who I'm fucking dealing with here.
I resent that.
You have a problem taking orders from me?
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.
That was my daughter.
And I can't help but think that physical affection means something.
They refrigerate this place, huh?
There you go.
What are you still doing out there?
I got involved in a lawsuit.
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.
What kind of lawsuit?
Hello.
- Also...
- What?
I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.
Oh, my God!
The doctor said...
What did he say?
"Mild concussion," he said.
Told me I'd be okay.
That's it.
I'm coming out there.
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.
No, don't do that.
Are you telling me everything?
JT, I want to introduce you to Carmine Lupertazzi my co-executive producer on the project.
Nice to finally meet.
I heard tidbits of what Chris has got in mind-- the genre and so forth.
But, JT, I gotta warn you,
I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.
I wanna welcome all of you to the first meeting of possible investors on this project.
Some of you know I've had nine pictures under my subspecies, four in the "South Beach Strumpet" series alone, each with 30,000-plus DVDs in print.
That being said, I usually find it helpful at this stage to include my prospective partners and get your inputs or notes as we call them.
JT, you're on.
Well... we've been working on a new kind of slasher film.
It takes place in the world of... you know... um, the mafia.
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams.
Anyway, they call him "The Butcher."
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?
Need I remind you of a certain butcher out of A.C.?
Right.
Not "Butcher." Go on, JT.
So, right.
He's kind of outshining his boss.
So the guy has him clipped, but he's still alive when they cut him up.
He's gonna feel that the next day.
Right.
So at the dump, his body reassembles itself, all except for a hand that got crushed.
So he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone, especially the boss, which is a pretty solid role.
Right now it's called "Pork Store Killer."
But I'm thinking... just...
"Cleaver."
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.
How's he evening up with anybody?
He's a ghost?
As I understood, a zombie of sorts.
Great title, by the way.
But if they jointed him, he's not gonna end up all in the same dump.
- And how's that a slasher film?
- What are you talking about?
A slasher.
A couple of kids naked in a lake.
Certified maniac on the loose, not a ghost.
Actually, the maniac is almost always a supernatural force.
Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers from "Halloween."
Get the fuck out.
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.
Michael Myers is an escaped mental patient.
Jason and Freddy, different kind of movie.
Well, that's the kind we're doing here.
"Saw," "The Ring"-- they made millions.
And that's not even including
"The Godfather" angle, which we got here.
What if... they disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route?
Then he would all end up in the same dump.
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.
"Ghostbusters"-- another fucking money machine.
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.
Again.
It's got bechamel on it, so five, six hours out of the fridge, tops.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Howdy.
Look at her.
That word "plucky," is that what it means?
Only, when do I get to spend some face time with the skip?
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.
...in this mob family domestic shooting, which some observers note carries the echoes of the death of soul great
Marvin Gaye.
As 20-year-old Anthony Soprano Jr. himself told our Amy Kean, "Growing up Soprano, it's just plain weird."
You just wanna bite it!
Big Lots!
What's your deal today?
Carmela?
I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- What the fuck?
- You made a fool of yourself and our family on national fucking television?
I didn't even say that shit.
They totally misquoted me.
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did.
That's what they do, which is why I and everybody else told you, "Don't talk to the press!"
You're the one who looked like a total asshole.
Dragging me around like I was five years old.
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.
To your father, to me, to everybody.
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!
Jesus, Mel, the hell's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
Mom.
It had to happen.
She's fried.
You have any extra compensation for what you've been going through?
Nah, part of the job.
Like they say, with great power comes great responsibility.
You know, Vito called me "skip" the other day.
Really?
Slip of the tongue, no doubt, but I noticed he didn't correct himself.
See?
If it did become permanent,
- your compensation might be...
- Don't go there.
Hi, Gab.
I need Sil for a second.
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.
This better be important, Bobby.
Got a new baby and two kids in private school.
This arrangement with Vito is killing me.
It's 9:30 at night.
Bobby, I don't remember what the fuck it was.
Roseville, this temporary shit.
I need an answer already.
I'm going out of my fucking mind here.
I'm liable to do something drastic.
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.
Mornings are better.
I'll come up with a solution.
I don't want you to worry about it.
I must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day.
See, you're Tony's therapist.
Whether it's appropriate...
How can I help you?
It's about my son.
Both kids, really.
The situation with the shooting.
I'm very worried about them.
Sure.
It's a very serious problem, you know, guns in the home.
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned our lesson too late.
I immediately removed all the firearms from the house after the goings-on at Tony's uncle's.
Anyway, last night, I was shrieking at my son, and I said something very cruel.
And especially since he's been trying so hard...
How are you doing?
You know, I'm frazzled certainly, but I am more worried about them.
They're not kids anymore.
When they were young, there were certain things we could tell them about Tony's life.
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just guns in the home.
Honestly, I think about my son in front of those cameras, having to vouch for all this.
My daughter and her friends.
They have to face all these years of facading.
They do or you do?
The minute I met Tony, I knew who that guy was.
On my second date, he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a $200 power drill.
Not the typical story of young love.
And I don't know if I loved him in spite of it... or because of it.
My parents weren't like that.
And I knew, whether consciously or not,
I knew that behind that power drill, there was probably some guy with a broken arm, you know, or worse.
And you coped with that, how?
I'd go to my priest, and I would cry, and say how bad I felt about how my husband made his money, but that was bullshit.
Because there are far bigger crooks than my husband.
But the kids... they don't decide who they're born to.
So now what?
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?
It's all out in the open now, the whole thing.
And them, they're not in grade school anymore.
They become... the longer they stay with us...
Complicit.
Oh, God.
Putting aside the moral and legal issues, clarity can't be a bad thing.
Yes.
Tony's second night in the coma, I told him I loved him.
When was the last time I said that?
Are you afraid you aren't going to feel that way when he wakes up?
Anthony tells me things have been... better between you.
Come here, honey.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
I can't breathe.
- It's all right.
- Come here, honey.
Can't breathe.
Can't breathe.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?
Sil, I didn't hear from you.
Sil's on the canvas now.
Fucking 100% disaster.
Point is, Tony goes,
let's face it, somebody's gonna have to step into the breach.
I'm a young man.
Now without the weight,
I'm a healthy man with longevity.
I hear Sil is at St. Barnabas.
My God, what is happening to us around here?
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.
Listen, sweetheart, you're expecting something, and I can't get into specifics, and Tony wouldn't want me to, but there are certain people looking over our shoulders right now.
It's okay, Vito.
I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries,
like this son of mine.
You gotta trust me on this, hon.
Suspicions get raised if we were to move it to you at this moment.
I got this.
Your ma says now's our moment.
The main thing, when people come to sit with dad, the doctors want positive talk.
- It helps in his recovery.
- Got it.
Oof, Madonn' he looks terrible.
Uncle Paulie, you can't say stuff like that.
You have to stay positive.
Yeah, it's just nothing prepares you for that.
Uncle Paulie!
Only one person at a time, please.
She's a ballbuster.
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?
Remember, stay positive.
I gotta wear a jock, the doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.
Of course, it could be a lot worse, right?
They gave me an ultrasound, no rupture.
I mean, the good thing is
I hurt it doing a major piece of business.
I saw a little action, and the next thing, I was at the urologist.
Fucking guy tells me I can't expect the same things from my body no more.
I tell you, T, first the eyes, then the teeth.
Next you find out you can't take pissing for granted.
Some joke, huh?
When I was in the service, I won the chin-ups cup three weeks in a row.
Fucking beautiful definition, too.
Guy asked me to model for the boxing poster.
He was half a fag, but I was flattered just the same.
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like an old lady's cunt.
You don't think it's gonna happen to you, but I'm feeling it, Tony.
Phineas Fogg back in town.
He forgets all the little people.
Hey, Vito, how's Mr. Soprano doing?
Let's hope he pulls through, huh?
Hi.
So glad you're here.
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be.
That-- don't worry about him.
He's harmless.
That fucking agita, T.
I mean, do I blame myself for this life?
The shit that happens, like with Puss.
Standup one day, fbi rat fuck the next.
I felt it here, T.
- I felt it right here.
- Will you please shut up in there?
I'm sorry.
Yes, the lnn at the Oaks.
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?
Out towards the beacon.
What is that beacon anyway?
Oh.
God damn it!
Shut up!
Shut up in there!
So I said to Ma--
What the fuck?
Dr. Budraja, stat to room 3.
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!
- Out of the way, sir.
- Oh, my God!
What's happening?
Soprano, V-tach on the monitor.
- Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure.
Get a board ready.
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.
Oh my God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?
I don't know what's happening.
One, two, three.
Oh, my God!
Still V-tach at 210.
150 mg of amiodaraone.
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.
Cardiovert at 100.
- Dad!
- Stand back.
- Daddy!
- All clear.
Clear.
- 200.
- Stand back.
- All clear.
- Clear.
Excuse me.
Is this the Finnerty reunion?
Hello there.
They're waiting for you.
- Me?
- Of course.
Has Kevin Finnerty arrived?
We don't talk like that here.
What do you mean?
Your family's inside.
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.
I don't understand.
- You're going home.
- I am?
Everyone's in there.
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.
I lost my real briefcase.
My whole life was in it.
Don't go, Daddy.
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.
- No, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- I don't want to.
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.
We love you, Daddy.
Don't leave us.
For some reason...
I'm scared.
Well, there's nothing to be scared of.
You can let it go.
Just come say hello.
All right.
Daddy!
Please don't leave us, Daddy.
We love you.
Dad?
His eyes are open.
Daddy, look at me right here.
All right, normal sinus rhythm.
- Pulse and pressure?
- Good.
Oh my God!
Thank God.
Thank God.
Hang an amiodaraone drip and send off a set of electrolytes now.
Dad, look, here you are.
So I'm holding his hand, and all of a sudden the machines go bullshit.
You told us, for Christ's sake.
Those fucking doctors, it's their fault.
Skip's gonna make it.
He's conscious.
Oh, thank God!
I got it, honey.
Fuck took you so long?
I had to get it together, didn't I?
We gotta get that cut to her now.
Easy, that's a fucking guilty move.
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?
Everybody and his mother was in there talking to him when he was in that coma.
Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?
Maybe he's expecting that money.
Jesus Christ.
He can't talk yet because of the tube that was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider ourselves lucky there.
But we are very happy, aren't we?
Anthony, you had us so worried.
I haven't been to church that much since I quit playing bingo.
What, honey?
I'm dead, right?
No no, you're in the hospital with all of us.
In Newark.
Mr. Soprano, how are you today?
I'm Dr. Vahapsideh.
I'm a neurologist.
How's he doing, sweetheart?
I don't know if we're out of the woods yet, but he's hanging in.
He just passed his first simple mental acuity test, so...
Your strength, that was the difference.
Oh, a little something from us.
Help defray medical costs, rehabilitation.
Jesus, I don't know what to say.
This is what we do, honey.
I'd want the same for my Marie.
Or my ma.
We're here if you need anything.
Great fucking news, T.
See you're up and around.
Best.
"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky.
Ojibwe saying."
Indians, right?
Who put this up?
Listen, T, something I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm gonna take another run at the movie business.
I know you haven't liked that in the past, but I'm going about it in a whole different way.
In fact, I'm hoping you'll become an investor when you feel a little better, and I can explain what we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.
We'll own the neg.
That's what they call it.
It means negative.
I'm holding a large ownership position open for you.
I hope you approve.
Actually, frankly... all due respect,
I think you owe me this, as I came to you about Adriana.
You've got him up?
I know how it looks, but he should be upright as much as possible.
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.
Okay.
I don't know how you do it.
That's gotta feel good, huh?
The simple things.
"Diary of a Thin Man."
- Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.
The devotion that kid shows.
I just think of my Marie, the kids, in that situation, God forbid.
My ma-- who the fuck would take care of her something happens?
Except Sil and you guys.
Colombians knock off at noon.
Then it's empty.
Manager's unit's down a flight.
- Who's in there?
- Open it.
What the fuck?
Get back!
- Shoot the prick.
- Get the fuck out of the way.
Cocksucking miserable Spic shit!
It's supposed to be empty here daytimes.
Jesus, my fucking balls!
The money!
Fuck, my fucking balls.
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.
Nothing.
Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.
Fuck that.
Close the goddamn door.
This fucking shit for a lousy two Gs?
Oh, Anthony.
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
Cugin'.
I'm gonna go ahead.
What's up?
You were at South Mountain Arena yesterday trying to buy a gun from that asshole in the snack shop.
Who told you that?
We know how you feel, but you can't do this.
I can't believe you know this.
Who told you this?
Look, if my pops was laying in there shot up
- l'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.
- Yeah, why the fuck not?
- Listen to me, I'm your uncle.
Junior's in federal lockup.
No one's getting to him there.
Well, it's difficult, but not impossible.
Trust me.
Your dad does not want you to get involved.
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.
Fuck your girlfriend more.
You little hothead here.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Did you park in emergency or in the garage?
What's going on in there?
They're on rounds or something, Dr. Plepler and the Indian girl.
Hi, did you bring me my sweater?
Your sweater?
Man, Jesus, fuck!
All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?
My problem is I'm old enough to sit with Dad all night, be a messenger boy, bring shit from the house, but I'm too young to deal with the larger issues?
- What are you talking about?
- Like you didn't put them up to it.
Put who up to what?
God, he was in such a good mood this morning.
I told the nurse that I thought he moved his eyebrows at around 5:30.
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna be furious.
Mrs. Soprano, you're really gonna have to recalibrate your expectations at this point.
We can't even maintain his blood pressure at a level that we'd like.
Until his fever dissipates and his white cell count comes down, we're a long way from home.
But he's really fighting.
Mom, he's really strong.
That is true.
Hi, Dad.
Monastery?
Oh!
I, uh... I received these this morning.
Do I really look that much like this guy?
To a certain extent, all Caucasians look alike.
Look, I'm not Finnerty.
I didn't sell you this heating equipment.
But I am kind of worried about what I might have done.
Because you see, yesterday--
Yes, tell us, there's no fraud without a fairy tale.
Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Oh, my.
And I'm in this strange city and--
Please come inside.
I came here because I thought you could help me reach Finnerty.
I have his wallet.
I have his briefcase, but I'm not him.
Excuse the brothers for laughing.
One day we will all die, and then we'll be the same as that tree.
No me, no you.
Be that as it may, we need heat.
We need to find someone who will take responsibility.
Well, I can't do that.
Then the lawsuit proceeds.
Hey, go home and I'll stay.
I just had Chinese food.
- Carmela?
- Dr. Melfi, hi.
How are you?
How are you is more the point.
I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee, or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing I have to have.
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.
I've been calling the hospital and they say that Anthony's stabilized.
That's what they say.
If you or anyone needs anything, to talk or to run interference with the doctors,
- don't hesitate to call.
- l appreciate that.
Thank you.
I have plenty of people around I can talk to.
Of course.
Good luck.
- Morning, Gab. ls he ready?
- He's eating.
We're picking up Mrs. S. at 10:00.
I saw her Tuesday.
How's she holding up, poor thing?
Not so hotso, really.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
You hear about the thing in the old neighborhood?
I'm not busy enough for all this?
Couple of guys left three on the floor in some Colombian laundry.
Thank you.
Two guys we know, huh?
Total bloodbath.
Somebody said a million plus.
What a score.
Fuckin' A.
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.
Listen, don't forget...
Oh, honey, your asthma kicking up?
Springtime.
Pollen's out of control.
- l am so proud of you.
- Acting boss.
I hoped the day would never come.
You've always sold yourself short.
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.
All I ever wanted was to carve out a little piece, enjoy some grandkids.
But how many guys could step into Tony's shoes
- and do the job you're doing?
- You think?
You have such strength in crisis.
Benny told me he feels honored to drive you.
You're firm about what you want without being obnoxious about it.
Sil, have you asked yourself what happens if, God forbid, Tony Soprano doesn't recover?
Listen, Gab, I never talk to you about my work.
And?
I'm gonna tell you something I never told anybody.
Back when Jackie was at the end, he floated the idea of me stepping up to the big seat.
Not Tony, me.
- Really?
- Yeah, but I thought...
- it's not for me.
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it.
I never saw myself as that kind of guy.
I'm more behind the scenes-- advice, strategy.
But here you are, Sil.
The times make the man, honey, not the other way around.
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary--
No change with Tony.
Carmela's in goddamn pieces.
Memo-- get some coffee up to Carmela's house.
Sil, Bobby was making collections up in Roseville again last night.
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.
You forget something, like my cut?
You believe this guy?
You should've lost some weight in that nose, keep it out of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.
It's these fucking flowers right here.
Get this shit out of here.
That was Junior's neighborhood, so now it's mine.
Keep your voice down here.
A va' Napoli-- it was Eugene's going on three years.
And Eugene was with me.
You should have never had it to begin with, except for the beef with the Tastee Freez route.
Junior ruled on it, and it wasn't right then.
This fucking guy.
Easy.
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.
Maybe that's what that miserab' admitted to you.
- l heard five.
- You heard wrong.
What do we do here, Sil?
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?
For the time being, it's Bobby's.
But he's still gonna kick up to you 20/%.
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah, Sil.
What, do you speak Norwegian?
For now.
We'll see how much is there.
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.
Hey, we just need some Irish Spring.
Good morning.
Another one?
Know what I found out yesterday?
What's that?
Thank you.
I was diagnosed actually... with Alzheimer's.
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
My uncle has memory loss.
Maybe it's hereditary.
Someone's probably studying that.
is it possible that I am Kevin Finnerty?
All right, I'll stop.
- Sil.
- What?
You heard about this Orange Street takedown?
The Colombians?
That you?
My guy had the tip.
Should be a nice chunk for everybody.
Everybody?
Carmela, she gets T's cut under the circumstances, correct?
It's your call.
I know it's my fucking call.
Yes, that is the correct thing.
Oh, ladies' room's next door.
I can reach it from here.
Grim fucking scene, that icu.
She's one brave lady.
I was just saying, I'm gonna get T's piece of my half to Sil for her.
- Of the thing.
- Back up there, Bluto.
Your half?
I did all the heavy lifting.
You would never have heard about it without my information.
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.
You said the place was empty.
Doc says I need an ultrasound on my groin and balls.
Sil, you wanna weigh in here?
It breaks half and half.
You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.
I'll have it for you, Sil, the whole 80K.
Ho, ho, ho, 80K?
How's that 20/% of a million?
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.
Fuck it all, Paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.
What's with the fucking accounting out there?
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?
We're looking after Carmela.
- No question.
- Of course.
Sooner than later, Paulie.
I gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?
In a prior incarnation, I would get my load on, blow 20 residuals at the track.
As writers, we are all hung up.
But we are also hung up on our own hang-up.
We mythologize our inner narrative.
Take for example, "Beowulf."
Who is Grendel, but the habit, the disease.
Ah, fresh casualties in the battle of the blank page.
Welcome to the Writer's Guild.
Have a seat.
Take me... my past as an addict.
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Give me that fucking fisheye.
I'm offering you a way to wipe your fucking obligation.
Wasn't me who told you to start gambling again.
I can't write a feature now.
I just landed a staff job.
People are seeing huge profits with these digital horror movies.
Douchebags who never made a film before.
That "Saw" thing, 400 grand to make, took in 100 mil worldwide.
I'm 100/% well.
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?
You hear this dude?
100/% well.
He's a bad boy, huh, with that lingo?
Real fucking dark character.
My idea is "Saw" meets "Godfather 2."
Proven track record-- both genres.
Young wiseguy, assassin, gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him, leave his body parts in dumpsters all around the city.
Long story short, he is put back together by science, or maybe it's supernatural.
And he gets fucking payback on everyone who fucked him over, including the cunt he was engaged to.
She was getting porked by his boss the night the hero was killed.
We'll have a meeting tomorrow.
We hear what you've fleshed out before we go to script.
Bing, 2:30.
Don't make me come look for you.
An entire room full of writers, and you did nothing!
Sir, it's family only in the unit.
I'll be out of your hair in a minute, sister.
I keep telling you people, I'm gonna have to call the hospital administrator.
I wanted to let you know there's a major package coming your way from Paulie and Vito, very significant.
You all have done so much already.
We just found out insurance won't pay for physical therapy.
Bastards.
So thank you.
You wanna come in, say hello?
Uh, sure.
- Hello, Father.
- Silvio.
I have Napoleons, but I also got fruit for a certain party.
Either's good.
The program says sugar after meals
- tells the body you're full.
- When you married my cousin, everybody used to say you looked like John Travolta.
He's almost back to his white suit.
The Bacala question.
Bobby don't have any claim.
I don't know why Sil ruled so half-assed on you. lt's not my style.
He's worried more about taking care of Carmela
- than the actual fucking earners.
- Please.
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds freezing his assets, who do you think's keeping Ginny in butter brickle?
Lucky for me, those last years I was in the can, my kid brother Billy took care of Patty and the grandkids.
Only to have that motherfucking animal Blundetto--
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.
It's hard to forget.
I don't forget.
I forget what we were talking about.
Me too.
What the fuck was it?
Oh, yeah, Jesus.
Carmela.
The thing is--
You want coffee, coz?
If you're already making it.
Hot water and lemon, hon.
Honestly... how can I short Carmela?
Maybe I'm not following you.
I'm as supportive as the next guy, but there's a point.
And what if Tony takes a turn for the worse?
I'm gonna hand her $100,000, and he dies the next day?
Be money down the drain.
It's tempting, but you can't think that way.
You all set now?
Yeah, I'm living it up here.
You still stewing about that money?
Spend some, you'll get over it.
I'll never get over it.
Certain people-- let me tell you.
Oh, come on, not Sil again.
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.
But I still gotta pay tribute to the princess of Little Italy.
- The boss' wife.
What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.
I'm on my way in now.
Yeah, good, and you might want to take care of that thing we talked about.
Which thing?
That big piece of pie you were bringing to the hospital
She's expecting you, so make it happen.
What are you worried about?
I think I know who I'm fucking dealing with here.
I resent that.
You have a problem taking orders from me?
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.
That was my daughter.
And I can't help but think that physical affection means something.
They refrigerate this place, huh?
There you go.
What are you still doing out there?
I got involved in a lawsuit.
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.
What kind of lawsuit?
Hello.
- Also...
- What?
I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.
Oh, my God!
The doctor said...
What did he say?
"Mild concussion," he said.
Told me I'd be okay.
That's it.
I'm coming out there.
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.
No, don't do that.
Are you telling me everything?
JT, I want to introduce you to Carmine Lupertazzi my co-executive producer on the project.
Nice to finally meet. I heard tidbits of what Chris has got in mind-- the genre and so forth.
But, JT, I gotta warn you, I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.
I wanna welcome all of you to the first meeting of possible investors on this project.
Some of you know I've had nine pictures under my subspecies, four in the "South Beach Strumpet" series alone, each with 30,000-plus DVDs in print.
That being said, I usually find it helpful at this stage to include my prospective partners and get your inputs or notes as we call them.
JT, you're on.
Well... we've been working on a new kind of slasher film.
It takes place in the world of... you know... um, the mafia.
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams.
Anyway, they call him "The Butcher."
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?
Need I remind you of a certain butcher out of A.C.?
Right.
Not "Butcher." Go on, JT.
So, right.
He's kind of outshining his boss.
So the guy has him clipped, but he's still alive when they cut him up.
He's gonna feel that the next day.
Right.
So at the dump, his body reassembles itself, all except for a hand that got crushed.
So he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone, especially the boss, which is a pretty solid role.
Right now it's called "Pork Store Killer."
But I'm thinking... just...
"Cleaver."
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.
How's he evening up with anybody?
He's a ghost?
As I understood, a zombie of sorts.
Great title, by the way.
But if they jointed him, he's not gonna end up all in the same dump.
- And how's that a slasher film?
- What are you talking about?
A slasher.
A couple of kids naked in a lake.
Certified maniac on the loose, not a ghost.
Actually, the maniac is almost always a supernatural force.
Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers from "Halloween."
Get the fuck out.
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.
Michael Myers is an escaped mental patient.
Jason and Freddy, different kind of movie.
Well, that's the kind we're doing here.
"Saw," "The Ring"-- they made millions.
And that's not even including
"The Godfather" angle, which we got here.
What if... they disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route?
Then he would all end up in the same dump.
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.
"Ghostbusters"-- another fucking money machine.
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.
Again.
It's got bechamel on it, so five, six hours out of the fridge, tops.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Howdy.
Look at her.
That word "plucky," is that what it means?
Only, when do I get to spend some face time with the skip?
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.
...in this mob family domestic shooting, which some observers note carries the echoes of the death of soul great
Marvin Gaye.
As 20-year-old Anthony Soprano Jr. himself told our Amy Kean, "Growing up Soprano, it's just plain weird."
You just wanna bite it!
Big Lots!
What's your deal today?
Carmela?
I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- What the fuck?
- You made a fool of yourself and our family on national fucking television?
I didn't even say that shit.
They totally misquoted me.
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did.
That's what they do, which is why I and everybody else told you, "Don't talk to the press!"
You're the one who looked like a total asshole.
Dragging me around like I was five years old.
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.
To your father, to me, to everybody.
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!
Jesus, Mel, the hell's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
Mom.
It had to happen.
She's fried.
You have any extra compensation for what you've been going through?
Nah, part of the job.
Like they say, with great power comes great responsibility.
You know, Vito called me "skip" the other day.
Really?
Slip of the tongue, no doubt, but I noticed he didn't correct himself.
See?
If it did become permanent,
- your compensation might be...
- Don't go there.
Hi, Gab.
I need Sil for a second.
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.
This better be important, Bobby.
Got a new baby and two kids in private school.
This arrangement with Vito is killing me.
It's 9:30 at night.
Bobby, I don't remember what the fuck it was.
Roseville, this temporary shit.
I need an answer already.
I'm going out of my fucking mind here.
I'm liable to do something drastic.
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.
Mornings are better.
I'll come up with a solution.
I don't want you to worry about it.
I must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day.
See, you're Tony's therapist.
Whether it's appropriate...
How can I help you?
It's about my son.
Both kids, really.
The situation with the shooting.
I'm very worried about them.
Sure.
It's a very serious problem, you know, guns in the home.
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned our lesson too late.
I immediately removed all the firearms from the house after the goings-on at Tony's uncle's.
Anyway, last night, I was shrieking at my son, and I said something very cruel.
And especially since he's been trying so hard...
How are you doing?
You know, I'm frazzled certainly, but I am more worried about them.
They're not kids anymore.
When they were young, there were certain things we could tell them about Tony's life.
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just guns in the home.
Honestly, I think about my son in front of those cameras, having to vouch for all this.
My daughter and her friends.
They have to face all these years of facading.
They do or you do?
The minute I met Tony, I knew who that guy was.
On my second date, he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a $200 power drill.
Not the typical story of young love.
And I don't know if I loved him in spite of it... or because of it.
My parents weren't like that.
And I knew, whether consciously or not, I knew that behind that power drill, there was probably some guy with a broken arm, you know, or worse.
And you coped with that, how?
I'd go to my priest, and I would cry, and say how bad I felt about how my husband made his money, but that was bullshit.
Because there are far bigger crooks than my husband.
But the kids... they don't decide who they're born to.
So now what?
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?
It's all out in the open now, the whole thing.
And them, they're not in grade school anymore.
They become... the longer they stay with us...
Complicit.
Oh, God.
Putting aside the moral and legal issues, clarity can't be a bad thing.
Yes.
Tony's second night in the coma, I told him I loved him.
When was the last time I said that?
Are you afraid you aren't going to feel that way when he wakes up?
Anthony tells me things have been... better between you.
Come here, honey.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
I can't breathe.
- lt's all right.
- Come here, honey.
Can't breathe.
Can't breathe.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?
Sil, I didn't hear from you.
Sil's on the canvas now.
Fucking 100/% disaster.
Point is, Tony goes, let's face it, somebody's gonna have to step into the breach.
I'm a young man.
Now without the weight, I'm a healthy man with longevity.
I hear Sil is at St. Barnabas.
My God, what is happening to us around here?
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.
Listen, sweetheart, you're expecting something, and I can't get into specifics, and Tony wouldn't want me to, but there are certain people looking over our shoulders right now.
It's okay, Vito.
I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries, like this son of mine.
You gotta trust me on this, hon.
Suspicions get raised if we were to move it to you at this moment.
I got this.
Your ma says now's our moment.
The main thing, when people come to sit with dad, the doctors want positive talk.
- lt helps in his recovery.
- Got it.
Oof, Madonn' he looks terrible.
Uncle Paulie, you can't say stuff like that.
You have to stay positive.
Yeah, it's just nothing prepares you for that.
Uncle Paulie!
Only one person at a time, please.
She's a ballbuster.
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?
Remember, stay positive.
I gotta wear a jock, the doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.
Of course, it could be a lot worse, right?
They gave me an ultrasound, no rupture.
I mean, the good thing is I hurt it doing a major piece of business.
I saw a little action, and the next thing, I was at the urologist.
Fucking guy tells me I can't expect the same things from my body no more.
I tell you, T, first the eyes, then the teeth.
Next you find out you can't take pissing for granted.
Some joke, huh?
When I was in the service, I won the chin-ups cup three weeks in a row.
Fucking beautiful definition, too.
Guy asked me to model for the boxing poster.
He was half a fag, but I was flattered just the same.
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like an old lady's cunt.
You don't think it's gonna happen to you, but I'm feeling it, Tony.
Phineas Fogg back in town.
He forgets all the little people.
Hey, Vito, how's Mr. Soprano doing?
Let's hope he pulls through, huh?
Hi.
So glad you're here.
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be.
That-- don't worry about him.
He's harmless.
That fucking agita, T.
I mean, do I blame myself for this life?
The shit that happens, like with Puss.
Standup one day, fbi rat fuck the next.
I felt it here, T.
- l felt it right here.
- Will you please shut up in there?
I'm sorry.
Yes, the lnn at the Oaks.
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?
Out towards the beacon.
What is that beacon anyway?
Oh.
God damn it!
Shut up!
Shut up in there!
So I said to Ma--
What the fuck?
Dr. Budraja, stat to room 3.
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!
- Out of the way, sir.
- Oh, my God!
What's happening?
Soprano, V-tach on the monitor.
- Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure.
Get a board ready.
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.
Oh my God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?
I don't know what's happening.
One, two, three.
Oh, my God!
Still V-tach at 210.
150 mg of amiodaraone.
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.
Cardiovert at 100.
- Dad!
- Stand back.
- Daddy!
- All clear.
Clear.
- 200.
- Stand back.
- All clear.
- Clear.
Excuse me.
is this the Finnerty reunion?
Hello there.
They're waiting for you.
- Me?
- Of course.
Has Kevin Finnerty arrived?
We don't talk like that here.
What do you mean?
Your family's inside.
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.
I don't understand.
- You're going home.
- l am?
Everyone's in there.
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.
I lost my real briefcase.
My whole life was in it.
Don't go, Daddy.
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.
- No, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- l don't want to.
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.
We love you, Daddy.
Don't leave us.
For some reason... I'm scared.
Well, there's nothing to be scared of.
You can let it go.
Just come say hello.
All right.
Daddy!
Please don't leave us, Daddy.
We love you.
Dad?
His eyes are open.
Daddy, look at me right here.
All right, normal sinus rhythm.
- Pulse and pressure?
- Good.
Oh my God!
Thank God.
Thank God.
Hang an amiodaraone drip and send off a set of electrolytes now.
Dad, look, here you are.
So I'm holding his hand, and all of a sudden the machines go bullshit.
You told us, for Christ's sake.
Those fucking doctors, it's their fault.
Skip's gonna make it.
He's conscious.
Oh, thank God!
I got it, honey.
Fuck took you so long?
I had to get it together, didn't I?
We gotta get that cut to her now.
Easy, that's a fucking guilty move.
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?
Everybody and his mother was in there talking to him when he was in that coma.
Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?
Maybe he's expecting that money.
Jesus Christ.
He can't talk yet because of the tube that was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider ourselves lucky there.
But we are very happy, aren't we?
Anthony, you had us so worried.
I haven't been to church that much since I quit playing bingo.
What, honey?
I'm dead, right?
No no, you're in the hospital with all of us.
In Newark.
Mr. Soprano, how are you today?
I'm Dr. Vahapsideh.
I'm a neurologist.
How's he doing, sweetheart?
I don't know if we're out of the woods yet, but he's hanging in.
He just passed his first simple mental acuity test, so...
Your strength, that was the difference.
Oh, a little something from us.
Help defray medical costs, rehabilitation.
Jesus, I don't know what to say.
This is what we do, honey.
I'd want the same for my Marie.
Or my ma.
We're here if you need anything.
Great fucking news, T.
See you're up and around.
Best.
"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky.
Ojibwe saying."
Indians, right?
Who put this up?
Listen, T, something I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm gonna take another run at the movie business.
I know you haven't liked that in the past, but I'm going about it in a whole different way.
In fact, I'm hoping you'll become an investor when you feel a little better, and I can explain what we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.
We'll own the neg.
That's what they call it.
It means negative.
I'm holding a large ownership position open for you.
I hope you approve.
Actually, frankly... all due respect, I think you owe me this, as I came to you about Adriana.
You've got him up?
I know how it looks, but he should be upright as much as possible.
- l'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.
Okay.
I don't know how you do it.
That's gotta feel good, huh?
The simple things.
- Diary Of A Thin Man.
Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.
The devotion that kid shows.
I just think of my Marie, the kids, in that situation, God forbid.
My ma, who the fuck would take care of her if something happens?
Except Sil and you guys.
Colombians knock off at noon.
Then it's empty.
Manager's unit's down a flight.
- Who's in there?
- Open it.
- What the fuck?
- Get back!
- Shoot the prick!
- Get the fuck out of the way!
- Cocksucking, miserable Spic shit!
- It's supposed to be empty here daytimes.
Jesus, my fucking balls!
The money!
Fuck!
My fucking balls!
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.
Nothing.
- Let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.
- Fuck that.
Close the goddamn door!
This fucking shit for a lousy two Gs?
Anthony.
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
Cugin'.
I'm gonna go ahead.
- What's up?
- You were at South Mountain Arena yesterday trying to buy a gun in the snack shop.
- Who told you that?
- We know how you feel, but you can't do this.
I can't believe you know this.
Who told you?
If my pops was laying in there shot up, I'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.
- Yeah, why the fuck not?
I'm your uncle.
Junior's in federal lock-up.
No one's getting to him there.
Well, it's difficult, but not impossible.
Trust me, your dad does not want you to get involved.
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.
Fuck your girlfriend more.
You little hothead here!
- Did you park in emergency or in the garage?
- What's going on in there?
They're on rounds or something, Dr Plepler and the Indian girl.
- Hi, did you bring me my sweater?
- Your sweater?
- Man, Jesus, fuck!
- All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?
I'm old enough to sit with Dad, bring shit from the house, but too young for the larger issues?
- What are you talking about?
- Like you didn't put them up to it.
Put who up to what?
God, he was in such a good mood this morning.
I told the nurse I thought he moved his eyebrows at around 5.30.
Did she pass that along?
If not, I'm gonna be furious.
Mrs Soprano, you're gonna have to recalibrate your expectations at this point.
We can't even maintain his blood pressure at a level that we'd like.
Until his fever dissipates and his white cell count comes down, we're a long way from home, but he's really fighting.
Mom, he's really strong.
That is true.
Hi, Dad.
Monastery?
I...
I received these this morning.
- Do I really look that much like this guy?
- To a certain extent, all Caucasians look alike.
All right, look, I'm not Finnerty.
I didn't sell you this heating equipment.
But I am kind of worried about what I might have done.
- Because, you see, yesterday...
- Tell us.
There's no fraud without a fairy tale.
Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
- My.
- And I'm in this strange city and...
Please, come inside.
I came here because I thought you could help me reach Finnerty.
I have his wallet, I have his briefcase, but I'm not him.
Excuse the brothers for laughing.
One day we will all die and then we'll be the same as that tree.
No me, no you.
Be that as it may, we need heat.
We need to find someone who will take responsibility.
- I can't do that.
- Then the lawsuit proceeds.
Go home and I'll stay.
I just had Chinese food.
- Carmela?
- Dr Melfi, hi.
How are you?
- How are you, is more the point.
- I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing I have to have.
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.
I've been calling the hospital and they say that Anthony's stabilised.
- That's what they say.
- If you or anyone needs anything, to talk or to run interference with the doctors, don't hesitate to call.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
I have plenty of people around I can talk to.
Of course.
Good luck.
- Morning, Gab.
Is he ready?
- He's eating.
- We're picking up Mrs S at ten.
- I saw her Tuesday.
- How's she holding up, poor thing?
- Not so hotso, really.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
Hear about the thing in the old neighbourhood?
I'm not busy enough for all this?
Couple of guys left three on the floor in some Colombian laundry.
Thank you.
- Two guys we know?
- Total bloodbath.
- Somebody said a million plus.
What a score!
- Fuckin' A.
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.
Listen, don't forget...
Honey, your asthma kicking up?
Springtime.
Pollen's out of control.
- I am so proud of you.
- Acting boss?
- I hoped the day would never come.
- You've always sold yourself short.
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.
All I ever wanted was to carve out a little piece, enjoy some grandkids.
How many guys could step into Tony's shoes and do the job you're doing?
- You think?
- You have such strength in crisis.
Benny feels honoured to drive you.
You're firm about what you want without being obnoxious about it.
Sil, have you asked yourself what happens if, God forbid, Tony Soprano doesn't recover?
- Gab, I never talk to you about my work.
- And?
I'm gonna tell you something I never told anybody.
Back when Jackie was at the end, he floated the idea of me stepping up to the big seat.
- Not Tony, me.
- Really?
- Yeah, but I thought, "It's not for me."
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it?
I never saw myself as that kind of guy.
I'm more behind the scenes.
Advice, strategy.
But here you are, Sil.
The times make the man, honey, not the other way around.
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's other ancillary...
- No change with Tony.
- Carmela's in goddamn pieces.
Memo.
Get some coffee up to Carmela's house.
Bobby was making collections up in Roseville again last night.
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.
You forget something?
Like my cut.
Can you believe this guy?
Lose weight on that nose.
Keep it out of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.
It's these fucking flowers right here.
Get this shit out of here.
That was Junior's neighbourhood so now it's mine.
Keep your voice down here.
It was Eugene's for three years and he was with me.
He should've never had it, except for the beef with the Tastee Freez route.
- Junior ruled on it and it wasn't right then.
- This fucking guy!
Easy.
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.
Maybe that's what that he admitted to you.
I heard five.
You heard wrong.
What do we do here, Sil?
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?
For the time being, it's Bobby's, but he's still gonna kick up to you 20%
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah.
What, do you speak Norwegian?
For now.
We'll see how much is there.
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.
Hey, we just need some Irish Spring.
Good morning.
Another one?
- Know what I found out yesterday?
- What's that?
Thank you.
I was diagnosed, actually... with Alzheimer's.
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, my uncle has memory loss.
Maybe it's hereditary.
Someone's probably studying that.
Is it possible that I am Kevin Finnerty?
All right, I'll stop.
Sil?
What?
Heard about this Orange Street takedown?
- The Colombians?
That you?
- My guy had the tip.
- Should be a nice chunk for everybody.
- Everybody?
Carmela.
She gets T's cut under the circumstances, correct?
It's your call.
I know it's my fucking call.
Yes, that is the correct thing.
Ladies' room's next door!
I can reach it from here!
Grim fucking scene, that ICU.
She's one brave lady.
I was just saying, I'm gonna get T's piece of my half to Sil for her.
- Of the thing.
- Back up, Bluto.
- Your half?
I did all the heavy lifting.
- You'd have never heard about it without me!
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.
You said the place was empty.
Doc says I need an ultrasound on my groin and balls.
Sil.
You wanna weigh in here?
It breaks half and half.
You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.
I'll have it for you, Sil, the whole 80K.
80K?
How's that 20% of a million?
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.
Fuck it all, Paulie, Tommy cased that shithole!
What's with the fucking accounting out there?
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?
We're looking after Carmela.
- No question.
- Of course.
Sooner than later, Paulie.
I gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?
In a prior incarnation, I would get my load on, blow 20 residuals at the track.
As writers, we are all hung up.
But we are also hung up on our own hang-up.
We mythologise our inner narrative.
Take, for example, Beowulf.
Who is Grendel?
But the habit, the disease...
Fresh casualties in the battle of the blank page!
Welcome to the Writers' Guild.
Have a seat.
Take me.
My past as an addict...
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Give me that fucking fisheye!
I'm offering you a way to wipe your obligation!
- I didn't tell you to start gambling again!
- I can't write a feature.
I just landed a staff job.
People are seeing huge profits with these digital horror movies.
Douchebags who never made a film before.
That Saw thing, 400 grand to make, took in 100 mil worldwide.
I'm 100% well?
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?
You hear this dude? "100% well." He's a bad boy, with that lingo?
Real fucking dark character.
My idea is Saw meets Godfather II.
Proven track record, both genres.
Young wiseguy, assassin, gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him, leave his body parts in dumpsters all around the city.
Long story short, he is put back together by science or maybe it's supernatural.
And he gets fucking payback on everyone who fucked him over, including the cunt he was engaged to.
She was getting porked by his boss the night the hero was killed.
We'll have a meeting tomorrow.
We'll hear what you fleshed out before we go to script.
Bing, 2.30.
Don't make me come look for you.
An entire room full of writers and you did nothing!
- Sir, it's family only in the unit.
- I'll be out of your hair in a minute.
I'm gonna have to call the hospital administrator.
There's a major package coming your way from Paulie and Vito.
Very significant.
You all have done so much already.
We just found out insurance won't pay for physical therapy.
Bastards!
So thank you.
You wanna come in, say hello?
Sure.
Hello, Father.
I have Napoleons, but I also got fruit for a certain party.
Either's good.
The programme says sugar after meals tells the body you're full.
When you married my cousin, everybody used to say you looked like John Travolta.
He's almost back to his white suit!
The Bacala question.
Bobby don't have any claim.
I don't know why Sil ruled so half-assed on you.
It's not my style.
He's worried more about Carmela than the fucking earners.
Please.
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds freezing his assets, who's keeping Ginny in Butter Brickle?
Lucky for me, those last years I was in the can, my kid brother Billy took care of Patty and the grandkids.
Only to have that motherfucking animal Blundetto...
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.
It's hard to forget.
I don't forget.
- I forget what we were talking about.
- Me, too.
What the fuck was it?
Yeah, Jesus.
Carmela.
The thing is...
- You want coffee, cuz?
- If you're already making it.
Hot water and lemon, hon.
Honestly... how can I short Carmela?
- Maybe I'm not following you.
- I'm as supportive as the next guy.
But there's a point.
And what if Tony takes a turn for the worse?
I'm gonna hand her $100,000 and he dies the next day?
- Be money down the drain.
- It's tempting, but you can't think that way.
You all set now?
Yeah, I'm living it up here.
Still stewing about that money?
Spend some, you'll get over it.
I'll never get over it.
- Certain people, let me tell you...
- Come on, not Sil again.
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.
But I still gotta pay tribute to the princess of Little Italy.
- The boss's wife.
What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.
I'm on my way in now.
- And take care of that thing we talked about.
- Which thing?
That big piece of pie you were bringing to the hospital.
Make it happen.
- What are you worried about?
- I know who I'm fucking dealing with.
- I resent that.
- You have a problem taking orders from me?
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.
That was my daughter.
I can't help but think that physical affection means something.
They refrigerate this place?
There you go.
- What are you still doing out there?
- I got involved in a lawsuit.
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.
What kind of lawsuit?
Hello?
- Also...
- What?
- I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.
- My God
The doctor said...
What did he say?
Mild concussion, he said.
- Told me I'd be OK.
- That's it, I'm coming out there.
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.
No, don't do that.
Are you telling me everything?
I want to introduce you to Carmine Lupertazzi, my co-executive producer on the project.
Nice to finally meet.
I heard titbits of what Chris has in mind, the genre and so forth.
But, JT, I gotta warn you, I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.
I wanna welcome all of you to the first meeting of possible investors on this project.
Some of you know I've had nine pictures under my subspecies.
Four in the South Beach Strumpet series alone, each with 30,000-plus DVDs in print.
I usually find it helpful at this stage to include my prospective partners and get your inputs, or notes, as we call them.
JT, you're on.
Well... we've been working on a new kind of slasher film.
It takes place in the world of... you know... the Mafia.
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams.
Anyway, they call him The Butcher and...
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?
Need I remind you of a certain butcher out of AC?
Right.
Not Butcher.
Go on, JT.
So, right...
He's kind of outshining his boss.
So the guy has him clipped, but he's still alive when they cut him up.
He's gonna feel that the next day!
Right.
So at the dump, his body reassembles itself.
All except for a hand that got crushed so he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone, especially the boss, which is a pretty solid role.
Right now it's called Pork Store Killer, but I'm thinking... just...
Cleaver.
- I'm confused.
You said he's dead.
- How's he evening up with anybody?
- He's a ghost?
- As I understood, a zombie of sorts.
Great title, by the way.
But if they jointed him, he's not gonna end up all in the same dump.
- How's that a slasher film?
- What are you talkin' about?
The slasher.
Couple of kids naked in a lake.
Certified maniac on the loose, not a ghost.
Actually, the maniac is almost always a supernatural force.
- Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers.
- Get the fuck out!
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.
Michael Myers is an escaped mental patient.
Jason and Freddy - different kind of movie.
That's the kind we're doing here.
Saw, The Ring, they made millions.
That's not including the Godfather angle, which we got here.
What if... they disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route?
Then he would all end up in the same dump.
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.
Ghostbusters.
Another fucking money machine!
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.
Again.
It's got bĆ©chamel on it so five, six hours out of the fridge, tops.
- Thank you.
- Howdy.
Look at her.
That word plucky, is that what it means?
When do I get to spend time with the skip?
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.
...in this mob family domestic shooting, which some observers note carries echoes of the death of...
As 20-year-old Anthony Soprano Junior himself told our Amy Kean...
"Growing up Soprano, it's just plain weird."
- You just wanna bite it!
- Big Lots!
What's your deal today?
Carmela?
- I swear, I'll fucking kill you!
- What the fuck?
You made a fool of yourself and our family on national fucking television?
I didn't even say that shit.
They totally misquoted me.
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did.
That's what they do!
Which is why I and everybody else told you, don't talk to the press!
You're the one who looked like a total asshole, dragging me around like I was five!
You're a cross to bear, that's all you are.
To your father, to me, to everybody!
Fuck this!
All right, fuck it all!
- Jesus, Mel, the hell's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?
- What's wrong with me?
- Mom...
Had to happen.
She's fried.
You have any extra compensation for what you've been going through?
Nah, part of the job.
Like they say, "with great power comes great responsibility."
You know, Vito called me "skip" the other day.
Really?
Slip of the tongue, no doubt, but I noticed he didn't correct himself.
See?
If it did become permanent, your compensation might be...
Don't go there.
Hi, Gab.
I need Sil for a second.
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.
This better be important, Bobby.
Got a new baby and two kids in private school.
This arrangement with Vito is killing me.
It's 9.30 at night.
Bobby, I don't remember what the fuck it was.
Roseville, this temporary shit, I need an answer already!
I'm going out of my fucking mind!
I'm liable to do something drastic!
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.
Mornings are better.
I'll come up with a solution.
I don't want you to worry about it.
I must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day.
See, you're Tony's therapist.
- Whether it's appropriate...
- How can I help you?
It's about my son.
Well, both kids, really.
The situation... with the shooting, I'm very worried about them.
Sure.
It's a very serious problem.
You know, guns in the home.
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned our lesson too late.
I removed all the firearms from the house after the goings-on at Tony's uncle's.
Anyway, last night, I was shrieking at my son... and I said something...
I said something very cruel.
And especially since he's been trying so hard.
How are you doing?
You know, I'm frazzled, certainly, but I am more worried about them.
They're not kids any more.
When they were young, there were certain things we could tell them about Tony's life.
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just guns in the home.
I think about my son in front of those cameras, having to vouch for all of this.
My daughter and her friends.
They have to face all these years of facading.
They do or you do?
The minute I met Tony, I knew who that guy was.
On my second date, he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a $200 power drill.
Not the typical story of young love.
And I don't know if I loved him in spite of it... or because of it.
My parents weren't like that.
And I knew, whether consciously or not, I knew that behind that power drill, there was probably some guy with a broken arm, you know, or worse.
And you coped with that, how?
I'd go to my priest and I would cry and say how bad I felt about how my husband made his money, but that was bullshit.
Because there are far bigger crooks than my husband.
But the kids, they don't decide who they're born to.
So now what?
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?
It's all out in the open now, the whole thing.
And them, they're not in grade school any more, they become...
The longer they stay with us...
Complicit.
God.
Putting aside the moral and legal issues... clarity can't be a bad thing.
Yes.
Tony's second night in the coma, I told him I loved him.
When was the last time I said that?
Are you afraid you aren't going to feel that way when he wakes up?
Anthony tells me things have been...
better between you.
- Can't breathe.
- It's OK, honey.
You're gonna be OK.
I can't breathe.
- It's all right.
- Can't breathe.
Can't breathe, can't breathe!
It's OK, honey.
You're gonna be OK.
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?
Sil, I didn't hear from you.
- Sil's on the canvas now.
- Fucking 100% disaster.
Point is, Tony goes, let's face it, somebody's gonna have to step into the breach.
I'm a young man and now, without the weight,
I'm a healthy man with longevity.
I hear Sil is at St Barnabas.
My God, what is happening to us around here?
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.
Listen, sweetheart, I know you're expecting something and I can't get into specifics,
Tony wouldn't want me to.
But certain people are looking over our shoulders right now.
It's OK, Vito, I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries.
Like this son of mine.
You gotta trust me on this, hon.
Suspicions get raised if we were to move it to you at this moment.
I got this.
Your ma says now's our moment.
The main thing, when people come to sit with Dad, the doctors want positive talk.
- It helps in his recovery.
- Got it.
- He looks terrible!
- Uncle Paulie, you can't say stuff like that.
- We have to stay positive.
- Yeah, it's just, nothing prepares you for that.
Uncle Paulie!
Only one person at a time, please.
She's a ballbuster.
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, OK?
Remember, stay positive.
I gotta wear a jock, the doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.
Course, it could be a lot worse, right?
They gave me an ultrasound, no rupture.
I mean, the good thing is I hurt it doing a major piece of business.
I saw a little action and the next thing, I was at the urologist.
Fucking guy tells me I can't expect the same things from my body no more.
I tell you, T, first the eyes, then the teeth.
Next you find out you can't take pissing for granted.
Some joke, huh?
When I was in the service, I won the chin-ups cup three weeks in a row.
Fucking beautiful definition, too!
Guy asked me to model for the boxing poster.
He was half a fag, but I was flattered just the same.
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like an old lady's cunt.
You don't think it's gonna happen to you, but I'm feeling it, Tone.
Phineas Fogg back in town.
He forgets all the little people.
Hey, Vito, how's Mr Soprano doing?
Let's hope he pulls through, huh?
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be.
That...
Don't worry about him.
He's harmless.
That fucking agita, T. I mean, do I blame myself for this life?
The shit that happens, like with Puss.
Stand-up one day, FBI rat-fuck the next.
I felt it here, T. I felt it right here.
Will you please shut up in there?
I'm sorry.
Yes, the Inn at the Oaks.
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?
Out towards the beacon.
What is that beacon, anyway?
God damn it!
Shut up!
Shut up in...
So I said to Ma...
What the fuck?
Dr Budraja, stat to room three.
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!
- Out of the way, sir.
- My God, what's happening?
- V-tach on the monitor.
Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure.
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.
My God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?
I don't know what's happening!
- One, two, three.
- Dr Budraja, stat.
- My God!
- Still V-tach at 210.
150 mg of amiodaraone.
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.
Cardiovert at 100.
- Dad!
- Stand back.
- Daddy!
- All clear.
Clear.
- 200.
- Stand back.
- All clear.
- Clear.
- Excuse me.
Is this the Finnerty reunion?
- Hello, there.
They're waiting for you.
- Me?
- Of course.
- Has Kevin Finnerty arrived?
- We don't talk like that.
- What do you mean?
- Your family's inside.
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.
- I don't understand.
- You're going home.
I am?
Everyone's in there.
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.
I lost my real briefcase.
My whole life was in it.
Don't go, Daddy.
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.
- No, no, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- I don't want to.
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.
We love you, Daddy.
Don't leave us.
For some reason...
- I'm scared.
- Nothing to be scared of.
You can let it go.
Just come say hello.
All right.
Daddy!
Please don't leave us, Daddy.
We love you.
Dad?
His eyes are open.
Daddy, look at me right here.
- Normal sinus rhythm.
Pulse and pressure?
- Good.
My God!
Thank God.
Thank God!
Hang an amiodaraone drip and send off a set of electrolytes now.
Dad, look, here you are.
So I'm holding his hand and all of a sudden the machines go bullshit!
- You told us, for Christ's sake.
- Those fucking doctors, it's their fault...
Skip's gonna make it, he's conscious!
Thank God!
I got it, honey.
- What the fuck took you so long?
- I had to get it together, didn't I?
- We gotta get that cut to her now.
- Easy, that's a fucking guilty move.
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?
Everybody and his mother was talking to him when he was in that coma.
Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?
Maybe he's expecting that money.
Jesus Christ.
He can't talk yet because of the tube that was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider ourselves lucky!
But we are very happy, aren't we?
Anthony, you had us so worried.
I haven't been to church that much since I quit playing bingo!
What, honey?
I'm dead, right?
No.
No, you're in the hospital with all of us.
In Newark.
Mr Soprano, how are you today?
I'm Dr Vahapsideh.
I'm a neurologist.
- How's he doing, sweetheart?
- Not out of the woods, but he's hanging in.
He just passed his first simple mental acuity test, so...
Your strength, that was the difference.
A little something from us.
- Help defray medical costs, rehabilitation.
- Jesus, I don't know what to say.
- This is what we do, honey.
- I'd want the same for my Marie.
Or my ma.
We're here if you need anything.
Great fucking news, T.
To see you up and around.
The best.
"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself...
"and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky.
"Ojibwe saying." Indians, right?
Who put this up?
Listen, T, something I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm gonna take another run at the movie business.
I know you haven't liked that in the past, but I'm going about it in a whole different way.
In fact, I'm hoping you'll become an investor when you feel better and I can explain what we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.
We'll own the neg.
That's what they call it.
It means negative.
I'm holding a large ownership position open for you.
I hope you approve.
Actually... frankly... all due respect...
I think you owe me this.
Because I came to you about Adriana.
- You've got him up?
- I know how it looks.
But he should be upright as much as possible.
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.
I don't know how you do it.
That's gotta feel good, huh?
The simple things.
"Diary of a Thin Man."
- Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.
The devotion that kid shows.
I just think of my Marie, the kids, in that situation, God forbid.
My ma... who the fuck would take care of her something happens?
Except Sil and you guys.
Colombians knock off at noon.
Then it's empty.
Manager's unit's down a flight.
- Who's in there?
- Open it.
What the fuck?
Get back!
- Shoot the prick.
- Get the fuck out of the way.
Cocksucking miserable Spic shit!
It's supposed to be empty here daytimes.
Jesus, my fucking balls!
The money!
Fuck, my fucking balls.
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.
Nothing.
Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.
Fuck that.
Close the goddamn door.
This fucking shit for a lousy two Gs?
Oh, Anthony.
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
Cugin'.
I'm gonna go ahead.
What's up?
You were at South Mountain Arena yesterday trying to buy a gun from that asshole in the snack shop.
Who told you that?
We know how you feel, but you can't do this.
I can't believe you know this.
Who told you this?
Look, if my pops was laying in there shot up
- I'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.
- Yeah, why the fuck not?
- Listen to me,
I'm your uncle.
Junior's in federal lockup.
No one's getting to him there.
Well, it's difficult, but not impossible.
Trust me.
Your dad does not want you to get involved.
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.
Fuck your girlfriend more.
You little hothead here.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Did you park in emergency or in the garage?
What's going on in there?
They're on rounds or something, Dr. Plepler and the Indian girl.
Hi, did you bring me my sweater?
Your sweater?
Man, Jesus, fuck!
All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?
My problem is I'm old enough to sit with Dad all night, be a messenger boy, bring shit from the house, but I'm too young to deal with the larger issues?
- What are you talking about?
- Like you didn't put them up to it.
Put who up to what?
God, he was in such a good mood this morning.
I told the nurse that I thought he moved his eyebrows at around 5:30.
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna be furious.
Mrs. Soprano, you're really gonna have to recalibrate your expectations at this point.
We can't even maintain his blood pressure at a level that we'd like.
Until his fever dissipates and his white cell count comes down, we're a long way from home.
But he's really fighting.
Mom, he's really strong.
That is true.
Hi, Dad.
Monastery?
Oh!
I, uh...
I received these this morning.
Do I really look that much like this guy?
To a certain extent, all Caucasians look alike.
Look, I'm not Finnerty.
I didn't sell you this heating equipment.
But I am kind of worried about what I might have done.
Because you see, yesterday...
Yes, tell us, there's no fraud without a fairy tale.
Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Oh, my.
And I'm in this strange city and...
Please come inside.
I came here because I thought you could help me reach Finnerty.
I have his wallet.
I have his briefcase, but I'm not him.
Excuse the brothers for laughing.
One day we will all die, and then we'll be the same as that tree.
No me, no you.
Be that as it may, we need heat.
We need to find someone who will take responsibility.
Well, I can't do that.
Then the lawsuit proceeds.
Hey, go home and I'll stay.
I just had Chinese food.
- Carmela?
- Dr. Melfi, hi.
How are you?
How are you is more the point.
I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee, or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing I have to have.
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.
I've been calling the hospital and they say that Anthony's stabilized.
That's what they say.
If you or anyone needs anything, to talk or to run interference with the doctors,
- don't hesitate to call.
- I appreciate that.
Thank you.
I have plenty of people around I can talk to.
Of course.
Good luck.
- Morning, Gab.
Is he ready?
- He's eating.
We're picking up Mrs. S. at 10:00.
I saw her Tuesday.
How's she holding up, poor thing?
Not so hotso, really.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
You hear about the thing in the old neighborhood?
I'm not busy enough for all this?
Couple of guys left three on the floor in some Colombian laundry.
Thank you.
Two guys we know, huh?
Total bloodbath.
Somebody said a million plus.
What a score.
Fuckin' A.
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.
Listen, don't forget...
Oh, honey, your asthma kicking up?
Springtime.
Pollen's out of control.
- I am so proud of you.
- Acting boss.
I hoped the day would never come.
You've always sold yourself short.
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.
All I ever wanted was to carve out a little piece, enjoy some grandkids.
But how many guys could step into Tony's shoes
- and do the job you're doing?
- You think?
You have such strength in crisis.
Benny told me he feels honored to drive you.
You're firm about what you want without being obnoxious about it.
Sil, have you asked yourself what happens if, God forbid, Tony Soprano doesn't recover?
Listen, Gab, I never talk to you about my work.
And?
I'm gonna tell you something I never told anybody.
Back when Jackie was at the end, he floated the idea of me stepping up to the big seat.
Not Tony, me.
- Really?
- Yeah, but I thought...
- it's not for me.
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it.
I never saw myself as that kind of guy.
I'm more behind the scenes... advice, strategy.
But here you are, Sil.
The times make the man, honey, not the other way around.
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary...
No change with Tony.
Carmela's in goddamn pieces.
Memo... get some coffee up to Carmela's house.
Sil, Bobby was making collections up in Roseville again last night.
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.
You forget something, like my cut?
You believe this guy?
You should've lost some weight in that nose, keep it out of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.
It's these fucking flowers right here.
Get this shit out of here.
That was Junior's neighborhood, so now it's mine.
Keep your voice down here.
A va' Napoli...
it was Eugene's going on three years.
And Eugene was with me.
You should have never had it to begin with, except for the beef with the Tastee Freez route.
Junior ruled on it, and it wasn't right then.
This fucking guy.
Easy.
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.
Maybe that's what that miserab' admitted to you.
- I heard five.
- You heard wrong.
What do we do here, Sil?
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?
For the time being, it's Bobby's.
But he's still gonna kick up to you 20%.
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah, Sil.
What, do you speak Norwegian?
For now.
We'll see how much is there.
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.
Hey, we just need some Irish Spring.
Good morning.
Another one?
Know what I found out yesterday?
What's that?
Thank you.
I was diagnosed actually... with Alzheimer's.
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
My uncle has memory loss.
Maybe it's hereditary.
Someone's probably studying that.
Is it possible that I am Kevin Finnerty?
All right, I'll stop.
- Sil.
- What?
You heard about this Orange Street takedown?
The Colombians?
That you?
My guy had the tip.
Should be a nice chunk for everybody.
Everybody?
Carmela, she gets T's cut under the circumstances, correct?
It's your call.
I know it's my fucking call.
Yes, that is the correct thing.
Oh, ladies' room's next door.
I can reach it from here.
Grim fucking scene, that ICU.
She's one brave lady.
I was just saying, I'm gonna get T's piece of my half to Sil for her.
- Of the thing.
- Back up there, Bluto.
Your half?
I did all the heavy lifting.
You would never have heard about it without my information.
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.
You said the place was empty.
Doc says I need an ultrasound on my groin and balls.
Sil, you wanna weigh in here?
It breaks half and half.
You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.
I'll have it for you, Sil, the whole 80K.
Ho, ho, ho, 80K?
How's that 20% of a million?
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.
Fuck it all, Paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.
What's with the fucking accounting out there?
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?
We're looking after Carmela.
- No question.
- Of course.
Sooner than later, Paulie.
I gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?
In a prior incarnation, I would get my load on, blow 20 residuals at the track.
As writers, we are all hung up.
But we are also hung up on our own hang-up.
We mythologize our inner narrative.
Take for example, "Beowulf."
Who is Grendel, but the habit, the disease.
Ah, fresh casualties in the battle of the blank page.
Welcome to the Writer's Guild.
Have a seat.
Take me... my past as an addict.
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Give me that fucking fisheye.
I'm offering you a way to wipe your fucking obligation.
Wasn't me who told you to start gambling again.
I can't write a feature now.
I just landed a staff job.
People are seeing huge profits with these digital horror movies.
Douchebags who never made a film before.
That "Saw" thing, 400 grand to make, took in 100 mil worldwide.
I'm 100% well.
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?
You hear this dude?
100% well.
He's a bad boy, huh, with that lingo?
Real fucking dark character.
My idea is "Saw" meets "Godfather 2."
Proven track record...
both genres.
Young wiseguy, assassin, gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him, leave his body parts in dumpsters all around the city.
Long story short, he is put back together by science, or maybe it's supernatural.
And he gets fucking payback on everyone who fucked him over, including the cunt he was engaged to.
She was getting porked by his boss the night the hero was killed.
We'll have a meeting tomorrow.
We hear what you've fleshed out before we go to script.
Bing, 2:30.
Don't make me come look for you.
An entire room full of writers, and you did nothing!
Sir, it's family only in the unit.
I'll be out of your hair in a minute, sister.
I keep telling you people, I'm gonna have to call the hospital administrator.
I wanted to let you know there's a major package coming your way from Paulie and Vito, very significant.
You all have done so much already.
We just found out insurance won't pay for physical therapy.
Bastards.
So thank you.
You wanna come in, say hello?
Uh, sure.
- Hello, Father.
- Silvio.
I have Napoleons, but I also got fruit for a certain party.
Either's good.
The program says sugar after meals
- tells the body you're full.
- When you married my cousin, everybody used to say you looked like John Travolta.
He's almost back to his white suit.
The Bacala question.
Bobby don't have any claim.
I don't know why Sil ruled so half-assed on you.
It's not my style.
He's worried more about taking care of Carmela
- than the actual fucking earners.
- Please.
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds freezing his assets, who do you think's keeping Ginny in butter brickle?
Lucky for me, those last years I was in the can, my kid brother Billy took care of Patty and the grandkids.
Only to have that motherfucking animal Blundetto...
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.
It's hard to forget.
I don't forget.
I forget what we were talking about.
Me too.
What the fuck was it?
Oh, yeah, Jesus.
Carmela.
The thing is...
You want coffee, coz?
If you're already making it.
Hot water and lemon, hon.
Honestly... how can I short Carmela?
Maybe I'm not following you.
I'm as supportive as the next guy, but there's a point.
And what if Tony takes a turn for the worse?
I'm gonna hand her $100,000, and he dies the next day?
Be money down the drain.
It's tempting, but you can't think that way.
You all set now?
Yeah, I'm living it up here.
You still stewing about that money?
Spend some, you'll get over it.
I'll never get over it.
Certain people...
let me tell you.
Oh, come on, not Sil again.
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.
But I still gotta pay tribute to the princess of Little Italy.
- The boss' wife.
What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.
I'm on my way in now.
Yeah, good, and you might want to take care of that thing we talked about.
Which thing?
That big piece of pie you were bringing to the hospital
She's expecting you, so make it happen.
What are you worried about?
I think I know who I'm fucking dealing with here.
I resent that.
You have a problem taking orders from me?
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.
That was my daughter.
And I can't help but think that physical affection means something.
They refrigerate this place, huh?
There you go.
What are you still doing out there?
I got involved in a lawsuit.
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.
What kind of lawsuit?
Hello.
- Also...
- What?
I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.
Oh, my God!
The doctor said...
What did he say?
"Mild concussion," he said.
Told me I'd be okay.
That's it.
I'm coming out there.
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.
No, don't do that.
Are you telling me everything?
JT, I want to introduce you to Carmine Lupertazzi my co-executive producer on the project.
Nice to finally meet.
I heard tidbits of what Chris has got in mind... the genre and so forth.
But, JT, I gotta warn you,
I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.
I wanna welcome all of you to the first meeting of possible investors on this project.
Some of you know I've had nine pictures under my subspecies, four in the "South Beach Strumpet" series alone, each with 30,000-plus DVDs in print.
That being said, I usually find it helpful at this stage to include my prospective partners and get your inputs or notes as we call them.
JT, you're on.
Well... we've been working on a new kind of slasher film.
It takes place in the world of... you know... um, the mafia.
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams.
Anyway, they call him "The Butcher."
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?
Need I remind you of a certain butcher out of A.C.?
Right.
Not "Butcher." Go on, JT.
So, right.
He's kind of outshining his boss.
So the guy has him clipped, but he's still alive when they cut him up.
He's gonna feel that the next day.
Right.
So at the dump, his body reassembles itself, all except for a hand that got crushed.
So he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone, especially the boss, which is a pretty solid role.
Right now it's called "Pork Store Killer."
But I'm thinking... just...
"Cleaver."
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.
How's he evening up with anybody?
He's a ghost?
As I understood, a zombie of sorts.
Great title, by the way.
But if they jointed him, he's not gonna end up all in the same dump.
- And how's that a slasher film?
- What are you talking about?
A slasher.
A couple of kids naked in a lake.
Certified maniac on the loose, not a ghost.
Actually, the maniac is almost always a supernatural force.
Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers from "Halloween."
Get the fuck out.
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.
Michael Myers is an escaped mental patient.
Jason and Freddy, different kind of movie.
Well, that's the kind we're doing here.
"Saw," "The Ring"... they made millions.
And that's not even including
"The Godfather" angle, which we got here.
What if... they disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route?
Then he would all end up in the same dump.
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.
"Ghostbusters"... another fucking money machine.
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.
Again.
It's got bechamel on it, so five, six hours out of the fridge, tops.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Howdy.
Look at her.
That word "plucky," is that what it means?
Only, when do I get to spend some face time with the skip?
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.
...in this mob family domestic shooting, which some observers note carries the echoes of the death of soul great
Marvin Gaye.
As 20-year-old Anthony Soprano Jr. himself told our Amy Kean, "Growing up Soprano, it's just plain weird."
You just wanna bite it!
Big Lots!
What's your deal today?
Carmela?
I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- What the fuck?
- You made a fool of yourself and our family on national fucking television?
I didn't even say that shit.
They totally misquoted me.
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did.
That's what they do, which is why I and everybody else told you, "Don't talk to the press!"
You're the one who looked like a total asshole.
Dragging me around like I was five years old.
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.
To your father, to me, to everybody.
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!
Jesus, Mel, the hell's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
Mom.
It had to happen.
She's fried.
You have any extra compensation for what you've been going through?
Nah, part of the job.
Like they say, with great power comes great responsibility.
You know, Vito called me "skip" the other day.
Really?
Slip of the tongue, no doubt, but I noticed he didn't correct himself.
See?
If it did become permanent,
- your compensation might be...
- Don't go there.
Hi, Gab.
I need Sil for a second.
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.
This better be important, Bobby.
Got a new baby and two kids in private school.
This arrangement with Vito is killing me.
It's 9:30 at night.
Bobby, I don't remember what the fuck it was.
Roseville, this temporary shit.
I need an answer already.
I'm going out of my fucking mind here.
I'm liable to do something drastic.
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.
Mornings are better.
I'll come up with a solution.
I don't want you to worry about it.
I must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day.
See, you're Tony's therapist.
Whether it's appropriate...
How can I help you?
It's about my son.
Both kids, really.
The situation with the shooting.
I'm very worried about them.
Sure.
It's a very serious problem, you know, guns in the home.
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned our lesson too late.
I immediately removed all the firearms from the house after the goings-on at Tony's uncle's.
Anyway, last night, I was shrieking at my son, and I said something very cruel.
And especially since he's been trying so hard...
How are you doing?
You know, I'm frazzled certainly, but I am more worried about them.
They're not kids anymore.
When they were young, there were certain things we could tell them about Tony's life.
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just guns in the home.
Honestly, I think about my son in front of those cameras, having to vouch for all this.
My daughter and her friends.
They have to face all these years of facading.
They do or you do?
The minute I met Tony, I knew who that guy was.
On my second date, he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a $200 power drill.
Not the typical story of young love.
And I don't know if I loved him in spite of it... or because of it.
My parents weren't like that.
And I knew, whether consciously or not,
I knew that behind that power drill, there was probably some guy with a broken arm, you know, or worse.
And you coped with that, how?
I'd go to my priest, and I would cry, and say how bad I felt about how my husband made his money, but that was bullshit.
Because there are far bigger crooks than my husband.
But the kids... they don't decide who they're born to.
So now what?
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?
It's all out in the open now, the whole thing.
And them, they're not in grade school anymore.
They become... the longer they stay with us...
Complicit.
Oh, God.
Putting aside the moral and legal issues, clarity can't be a bad thing.
Yes.
Tony's second night in the coma, I told him I loved him.
When was the last time I said that?
Are you afraid you aren't going to feel that way when he wakes up?
Anthony tells me things have been... better between you.
Come here, honey.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
I can't breathe.
- It's all right.
- Come here, honey.
Can't breathe.
Can't breathe.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?
Sil, I didn't hear from you.
Sil's on the canvas now.
Fucking 100% disaster.
Point is, Tony goes, let's face it, somebody's gonna have to step into the breach.
I'm a young man.
Now without the weight,
I'm a healthy man with longevity.
I hear Sil is at St. Barnabas.
My God, what is happening to us around here?
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.
Listen, sweetheart, you're expecting something, and I can't get into specifics, and Tony wouldn't want me to, but there are certain people looking over our shoulders right now.
It's okay, Vito.
I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries, like this son of mine.
You gotta trust me on this, hon.
Suspicions get raised if we were to move it to you at this moment.
I got this.
Your ma says now's our moment.
The main thing, when people come to sit with dad, the doctors want positive talk.
- It helps in his recovery.
- Got it.
Oof, Madonn' he looks terrible.
Uncle Paulie, you can't say stuff like that.
You have to stay positive.
Yeah, it's just nothing prepares you for that.
Uncle Paulie!
Only one person at a time, please.
She's a ballbuster.
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?
Remember, stay positive.
I gotta wear a jock, the doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.
Of course, it could be a lot worse, right?
They gave me an ultrasound, no rupture.
I mean, the good thing is
I hurt it doing a major piece of business.
I saw a little action, and the next thing, I was at the urologist.
Fucking guy tells me I can't expect the same things from my body no more.
I tell you, T, first the eyes, then the teeth.
Next you find out you can't take pissing for granted.
Some joke, huh?
When I was in the service, I won the chin-ups cup three weeks in a row.
Fucking beautiful definition, too.
Guy asked me to model for the boxing poster.
He was half a fag, but I was flattered just the same.
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like an old lady's cunt.
You don't think it's gonna happen to you, but I'm feeling it, Tony.
Phineas Fogg back in town.
He forgets all the little people.
Hey, Vito, how's Mr. Soprano doing?
Let's hope he pulls through, huh?
Hi.
So glad you're here.
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be.
That... don't worry about him.
He's harmless.
That fucking agita, T.
I mean, do I blame myself for this life?
The shit that happens, like with Puss.
Standup one day, FBI rat fuck the next.
I felt it here, T.
- I felt it right here.
- Will you please shut up in there?
I'm sorry.
Yes, the Inn at the Oaks.
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?
Out towards the beacon.
What is that beacon anyway?
Oh.
God damn it!
Shut up!
Shut up in there!
So I said to Ma...
What the fuck?
Dr. Budraja, stat to room 3.
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!
- Out of the way, sir.
- Oh, my God!
What's happening?
Soprano, V-tach on the monitor.
- Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure.
Get a board ready.
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.
Oh my God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?
I don't know what's happening.
One, two, three.
Oh, my God!
Still V-tach at 210.
150 mg of amiodaraone.
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.
Cardiovert at 100.
- Dad!
- Stand back.
- Daddy!
- All clear.
Clear.
- 200.
- Stand back.
- All clear.
- Clear.
Excuse me.
Is this the Finnerty reunion?
Hello there.
They're waiting for you.
- Me?
- Of course.
Has Kevin Finnerty arrived?
We don't talk like that here.
What do you mean?
Your family's inside.
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.
I don't understand.
- You're going home.
- I am?
Everyone's in there.
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.
I lost my real briefcase.
My whole life was in it.
Don't go, Daddy.
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.
- No, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- I don't want to.
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.
We love you, Daddy.
Don't leave us.
For some reason...
I'm scared.
Well, there's nothing to be scared of.
You can let it go.
Just come say hello.
All right.
Daddy!
Please don't leave us, Daddy.
We love you.
Dad?
His eyes are open.
Daddy, look at me right here.
All right, normal sinus rhythm.
- Pulse and pressure?
- Good.
Oh my God!
Thank God.
Thank God.
Hang an amiodaraone drip and send off a set of electrolytes now.
Dad, look, here you are.
So I'm holding his hand, and all of a sudden the machines go bullshit.
You told us, for Christ's sake.
Those fucking doctors, it's their fault.
Skip's gonna make it.
He's conscious.
Oh, thank God!
I got it, honey.
Fuck took you so long?
I had to get it together, didn't I?
We gotta get that cut to her now.
Easy, that's a fucking guilty move.
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?
Everybody and his mother was in there talking to him when he was in that coma.
Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?
Maybe he's expecting that money.
Jesus Christ.
He can't talk yet because of the tube that was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider ourselves lucky there.
But we are very happy, aren't we?
Anthony, you had us so worried.
I haven't been to church that much since I quit playing bingo.
What, honey?
I'm dead, right?
No no, you're in the hospital with all of us.
In Newark.
Mr. Soprano, how are you today?
I'm Dr. Vahapsideh.
I'm a neurologist.
How's he doing, sweetheart?
I don't know if we're out of the woods yet, but he's hanging in.
He just passed his first simple mental acuity test, so...
Your strength, that was the difference.
Oh, a little something from us.
Help defray medical costs, rehabilitation.
Jesus, I don't know what to say.
This is what we do, honey.
I'd want the same for my Marie.
Or my ma.
We're here if you need anything.
Great fucking news, T.
See you're up and around.
Best.
"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky.
Ojibwe saying."
Indians, right?
Who put this up?
Listen, T, something I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm gonna take another run at the movie business.
I know you haven't liked that in the past, but I'm going about it in a whole different way.
In fact, I'm hoping you'll become an investor when you feel a little better, and I can explain what we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.
We'll own the neg.
That's what they call it.
It means negative.
I'm holding a large ownership position open for you.
I hope you approve.
Actually, frankly... all due respect,
I think you owe me this, as I came to you about Adriana.
You've got him up?
I know how it looks, but he should be upright as much as possible.
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.
Okay.
I don't know how you do it.
That's gotta feel good, huh?
The simple things.
Where you been?
Hospital, helping Carmela.
The devotion that kid shows.
I just think of my Marie, the kids,
In that situation, God forbid.
My ma... who the fuck would take care of her something happens?
Except Sil and you guys.
Colombians knock off at noon.
then it's empty.
Managers unit's down a flight.
¡cuidado!
¡que alguien viene!
- who's in there?
- open it.
¡no dispares, soy yo!
What the fuck?
Get back!
- Shoot the prick.
- Get the fuck out Of the way.
Cocksucking miserable Spic shit!
It's supposed to be Empty here daytimes.
Jesus, my fucking balls!
The money!
Fuck, my fucking balls.
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.
Nothing.
Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.
Fuck that.
Close the goddamn door.
This fucking shit for a lousy two G's?
Oh, Anthony.
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
Cugin'.
I'm gonna go ahead.
What's up?
You were at South Mountain Arena yesterday
Trying to buy a gun from that asshole in the snack shop.
Who told you that?
We know how you feel, But you can't do this.
I can't believe you know this.
Who told You this?
Look, if my pops was laying in there shot up
- I'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.
Yeah, why the fuck not?
Listen to me, I'm your uncle.
Junior's in federal lock-up.
No one's getting to him there.
Well, it's difficult, but not impossible.
Trust me.
Your dad does not want you to get involved.
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden gloves.
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.
Fuck your girlfriend more.
You little hothead here.
Did you park in emergency or in the garage?
What's going on in there?
They're on rounds or something, Dr. Plepler and the Indian girl.
Hi, did you bring me my sweater?
Your sweater?
Man, Jesus, fuck!
All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?
My problem is I'm old enough to sit With dad all night, be a messenger boy, bring shit from the house,
But I'm too young to deal with the larger issues?
What are you talking about?
Like you didn't put them up to it.
Put who up to what?
God, he was in such a good mood this morning.
I told the nurse that I thought he moved his eyebrows at around 5:30.
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna be furious.
Mrs. Soprano, you're really gonna have to recalibrate your expectations at this point.
We can't even maintain his blood pressure at a level that we'd like.
Until his fever dissipates and his white cell count comes down, we're a long way from home.
But he's really fighting.
Mom, he's really strong.
That is true.
Hi, dad.
Monastery?
I received these this morning.
Do I really look that much like this guy?
To a certain extent, all Caucasians look alike.
Look, I'm not Finnerty.
I didn't sell you this heating equipment.
But I am kind of worried about what I might have done.
Because you see, yesterday...
Yes, tell us, there's no fraud without a fairy tale.
Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Oh, my.
And I'm in this strange city and...
Please come inside.
I came here because I thought you could help me reach Finnerty.
I have his wallet.
I have his briefcase, but I'm not him.
Excuse the brothers for laughing.
One day we will all die, and then we'll be the same as that tree.
No me, no you.
Be that as it may, we need heat.
We need to find someone who will take responsibility.
Well, I can't do that.
Then the lawsuit proceeds.
Hey, go home and I'll stay.
I just had Chinese food.
Carmela?
Dr. Melfi, hi.
How are you?
How are you is more the point.
I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee, or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing I have to have.
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.
I've been calling the hospital and they say that Anthony's stabilized.
That's what they say.
If you or anyone needs anything, to talk or to run interference with the doctors, don't hesitate to call.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
I have plenty of people around I can talk to.
Of course.
Good luck.
Morning, Gab.
Is he ready?
He's eating.
We're picking up Mrs. S. at 10:00.
I saw her Tuesday.
How's she holding up, poor thing?
Not so hotso, really.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
You hear about the thing in the old neighborhood?
I'm not busy enough for all this?
Couple of guys left three on the floor in some Colombian laundry.
Two guys we know, Huh?
Total blood bath.
Somebody said a million plus.
What a score.
Fuckin' a.
Sil, Benny says you have to go.
Yeah, all right.
Listen, don't forget...
Oh, honey, your asthma kicking up?
Springtime.
Pollen's out of control.
I am so proud of you.
Acting boss.
I hoped the day would never come.
You've always sold yourself short.
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.
All I ever wanted was to carve out a little piece, enjoy some grand kids.
But how many guys could step into Tony's shoes
- And do the job you're doing?
- You think?
You have such strength in crisis.
Benny told me he feels honored to drive you.
You're firm about what you want without being obnoxious about it.
Sil, have you asked yourself what happens if, god forbid, Tony Soprano doesn't recover?
Listen, Gab, I never talk to you about my work.
And?
I'm gonna tell you something I never told anybody.
Back when Jackie was at the end, he floated the idea of me stepping up to the big seat.
Not Tony, me.
Really?
Yeah, but I thought...
it's not for me.
Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it.
I never saw myself as that kind of guy.
I'm more behind the scenes... advice, strategy.
But here you are, Sil.
The times make the man, honey, not the other way around.
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary...
No change with Tony.
Carmela's in goddamn pieces.
Memo... get some coffee up to Carmela's house.
Sil, Bobby was making collections up in Roseville again last night.
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.
You forget something, like my cut?
You believe this guy?
You should've lost some weight in that nose, keep it out of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.
It's these fucking flowers right here.
Get this shit out of here.
That was Junior's neighborhood, so now it's mine.
Keep your voice down here.
A va'napola...
It was Eugene's going on three years.
And Eugene was with me.
You should have never had it to begin with, except for the beef with the Tasty Freeze route.
Junior ruled on it, and it wasn't right then.
This fucking guy.
Easy.
- How much we talking about?
- Three G's a week.
Maybe that's what that miserab' admitted to you.
I heard five.
You heard wrong.
What do we do here, Sil?
Here's the thing.
What, skip?
For the time being, it's Bobby's.
But he's still gonna kick up to you 20%.
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah, Sil.
What, do you speak Norwegian?
For now.
We'll see how much is there.
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.
Hey, we just need some Irish Spring.
Good morning.
Another one?
- Know what I Found out yesterday?
- What's that?
I was diagnosed actually... with Alzheimer's.
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
My uncle has memory loss.
Maybe it's hereditary.
Someone's probably studying that.
Is it possible that I am Kevin Finnerty?
All right, I'll stop.
Sil.
What?
You heard about this Oran Street takedown?
The Colombians?
That you?
My guy had the tip.
Should be a nice chunk for everybody.
Everybody?
Carmela, she gets T's cut under the circumstances, correct?
It's your call.
I know it's my fucking call.
Yes, that is the correct thing.
Oh, ladies' room's next door.
I can reach it from here.
Grim fucking scene, that I.C.U.
She's one brave lady.
I was just saying, I'm gonna get T's piece of my half to Sil for her.
Of the thing.
Back up there, Bruto.
Your half?
I did all the heavy lifting.
You would never have heard about it without my information.
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.
You said the place was empty.
Doc says I need an ultrasound on my groin and balls.
Sil, you wanna weigh in here?
It breaks half and half.
You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.
I'll have it for you Sil, the whole 80k.
Ho, ho, ho, 80k?
How's that 20% of a million?
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.
Fuck it all, Paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.
What's with the fucking accounting out there?
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?
We're looking after Carmela.
- No question.
- Of course.
Sooner than later, Paulie.
I gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?
In a prior incarnation, I would get my load on, blow 20 residuals at the track.
As writers, we are all hung up.
But we are also hung up on our own hang-up.
We mythologize our inner narrative.
Take for example, "Beowulf."
Who is Grendel, but the habit, the disease.
Ah, fresh casualties in the battle of the blank page.
Welcome to the writer's guild.
Have a seat.
Take me...
My past as an addict.
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Give me that fucking fisheye.
I'm offering you a way to wipe your fucking obligation.
Wasn't me who told you to start gambling again.
I can't write a feature now.
I just landed a staff job.
People are seeing huge profits with these digital horror movies.
Douchebags who never made a film before.
That "Saw" thing, 400 grand to make, took in 100 mil worldwide.
I'm 100% well.
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?
You hear this dude?
100% well.
He's a bad boy, huh, with that lingo?
Real fucking dark character.
My idea is "Saw" meets "Godfather 2."
Proven track record... both genres.
Young wiseguy, assassin, gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him.
Leave his body parts in dumpsters all around the city.
Long story short, he is put back together by science, or maybe it's supernatural.
And he gets fucking payback on everyone who fucked him over, including the cunt he was engaged to.
She was getting porked by his boss the night the hero was killed.
We'll have a meeting tomorrow.
We hear what you've fleshed out before we go to script.
Bing, 2:30.
Don't make me come look for you.
An entire room full of writers, and you did nothing!
Sir, it's family only in the unit.
I'll be out of your hair in a minute, sister.
I keep telling you people, I'm gonna have to call the hospital administrator.
I wanted to let you know there's a major package coming your way
From Paulie and Vito, very significant.
You all have done so much already.
We just found out insurance won't pay for physical therapy.
Bastards.
So thank you.
You wanna come in, say hello?
Uh, sure.
Hello, father.
Silvio.
I have napoleons, but I also got fruit for a certain party.
Either's good.
The program says sugar after meals, tells the body you're full.
When you married my cousin, everybody used to say you looked like John Travolta.
He's almost back to his white suit.
The bacala question.
Bobby don't have any claim.
I don't know why Sil ruled so half-assed on you.
It's not my style.
He's worried more about taking care of Carmela than the actual fucking earners.
Please.
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds freezing his assets,
Who do you think's keeping Ginny in butter brickle?
Lucky for me, those last years I was in the can, my kid brother Billy took care of Patty and the grandkids.
Only to have that motherfucking animal Blundetto...
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.
It's hard to forget.
I don't forget.
I forget what we were talking about.
Me too.
What the fuck was it?
Carmela.
The thing is...
You want coffee, coz?
If you're already making it.
Hot water and lemon, hon.
Honestly...
How can I short Carmela?
Maybe I'm not following you.
I'm as supportive as the next guy, but there's a point.
And what if Tony takes a turn for the worse?
I'm gonna hand her $100,000, and he dies the next day?
Be money down the drain.
It's tempting, but you can't think that way.
You all set now?
Yeah, I'm living it up here.
You still stewing about that money?
Spend some, you'll get over it.
I'll never get over it.
Certain people...
let me tell you.
Oh, come on, not Sil again.
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.
But I still gotta pay tribute to the princess of Little Italy.
The boss' wife.
What are you gonna do?
Fuck her.
I'm on my way in now.
Yeah, good, and you might want to take care of that thing we talked about.
Which thing?
That big piece of pie you were bringing to the hospital.
She's expecting you, so make it happen.
What are you worried about?
I think I know who I'm fucking dealing with here.
I resent that.
You have a problem taking orders from me?
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.
That was my daughter.
And I can't help but think that physical affection means something.
They refrigerate this place, huh?
There you go.
What are you still doing out there?
I got involved in a lawsuit.
A lawsuit?
Could create problems later.
What kind of lawsuit?
Also...
What?
I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.
Oh my God!
The doctor said...
What'd he say?
"Mild concussion," he said.
Told me I'd be okay.
That's it.
I'm coming out there.
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.
No, don't do that.
Are you telling me everything?
J.T., I want to introduce you to Carmine Lupertazzi my co-executive producer on the project.
Nice to finally meet.
I heard tidbits of what Chris has got in mind... the genre and so forth.
But, J.T., I gotta warn you,
I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.
I wanna welcome all of you to the first meeting of possible investors on this project.
Some of you know I've had nine pictures under my subspecies,
Four in the "South Beach Strumpet" series alone, each with 30,000-plus DVDs in print.
That being said, I usually find it helpful at this stage to include my prospective partners and get your inputs or notes as we call them.
J.T., you're on.
We've been working on a new kind of slasher film.
It takes place in the world of...
You know...
Um, the mafia.
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams.
Anyway, they call him "the butcher."
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?
Need I remind you of a certain butcher out of A.C.?
Right.
Not "butcher." go on, J.T.
So, right.
He's kind of outshining his boss.
So the guy has him clipped, but he's still alive when they cut him up.
He's gonna feel that the next day.
Right.
So at the dump, his body reassembles itself, all except for a hand that got crushed.
So he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone, especially the boss, which is a pretty solid role.
Right now it's called "Pork Store Killer."
But I'm thinking...
Just...
"Cleaver."
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.
How's he evening up with anybody?
He's a ghost?
As I understood, a zombie of sorts.
Great title, by the way.
But if they jointed him,
He's not gonna end up all in the same dump.
- And how's that a slasher film?
- What are you talking about?
A slasher.
A couple of kids naked in a lake.
Certified maniac on the loose, not a ghost.
Actually, the maniac is almost always a supernatural force.
Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers from "Halloween."
Get the fuck out.
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.
Michael Myers is an escaped mental patient.
Jason and Freddy, different kind of movie.
Well, that's the kind we're doing here.
"Saw," "The Ring"... they made millions.
And that's not even including "The Godfather" Angle, which we got here.
What if...
They disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route?
Then he would all end up in the same dump.
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.
"Ghostbusters"... another fucking money machine.
Cavalry's here.
I brought some Cannelloni.
Again.
It's got bechamel on it, so five, six hours out of the fridge, tops.
Look at her.
That word "plucky," is that what it means?
Only, when do I get to spend some face time with the skip?
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.
...in this mob family domestic shooting, which some observers note carries the echoes of the death of soul great Marvin Gaye.
As 20-year-old Anthony Soprano Jr. himself told our Amy Kean,
"growing up Soprano, it's just plain weird."
Carmela?
- I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- What the fuck?
You made a fool of yourself and our family on national fucking television?
I didn't even say that shit.
They totally misquoted me.
- Holy shit.
Well, of course they did.
That's what they do.
Which is why I and everybody else told you, "don't talk to the press!"
You're the one who looked like a total asshole.
Dragging me around like I was five years old.
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.
To your father, to me, to everybody.
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!
Jesus, Mel, the hell's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
Mom.
It had to happen.
She's fried.
You have any extra compensation for what you've been going through?
Nah, part of the job.
Like they say, with great power comes great responsibility.
You know, Vito called me "Skip" the other day.
Really?
Slip of the tongue no doubt,
But I noticed he didn't correct himself.
See?
If it did become permanent, your compensation might be... don't go there.
Hi, gab.
I need Sil for a second.
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.
This better be Important, Bobby.
Got a new baby and two kids in private school.
This arrangement with Vito is killing me.
It's 9:30 at night.
Bobby, I don't remember what the fuck it was.
Roseville, this temporary shit.
I need an answer already.
I'm going out of my fucking mind here.
I'm liable to do something drastic.
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.
Mornings are better.
I'll come up with a solution.
I don't want you to worry about it.
I must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day.
See, you're Tony's therapist.
Whether it's appropriate...
How can I help you?
It's about my son.
Both kids, really.
The situation with the shooting.
I'm very worried about them.
Sure.
It's a very serious problem, you know, guns in the home.
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned our lesson too late.
I immediately removed all the firearms from the house after the goings-on at Tony's uncle's.
Anyway, last night,
I was shrieking at my son, and I said something very cruel.
And especially since he's been trying so hard...
How are you doing?
You know, I'm frazzled certainly,
But I am more worried about them.
They're not kids anymore.
When they were young, there were certain things we could tell them about Tony's life.
You know, lies.
We'll just call Them what they were.
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just guns in the home.
Honestly, I think about my son in front of those cameras, having to vouch for all this.
My daughter and her friends.
They have to face all these years of facading.
They do or you do?
The minute I met Tony, I knew who that guy was.
On my second date, he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a $200 power drill.
Not the typical story of young love.
And I don't know if I loved him in spite of it...
Or because of it.
Parents weren't like that.
And I knew, whether consciously or not, I knew that behind that power drill, there was probably some guy with a broken arm, you know, or worse.
And you coped with that, how?
I'd go to my priest, and I would cry, and say how bad I felt about how my husband made his money, but that was bullshit.
Because there are far bigger crooks than my husband.
But the kids... they don't decide who they're born to.
So now what?
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?
It's all out in the open now, the whole thing.
And them, they're not in grade school anymore.
They become... the longer they stay with us...
Complicit.
Oh, God.
Putting aside the moral and legal issues, clarity can't be a bad thing.
Tony's second night in the coma, I told him I loved him.
When was the last time I said that?
Are you afraid you aren't going to feel that way when he wakes up?
Anthony tells me things are better between you.
I can't breathe.
- It's all right.
- Come here, honey.
Can't breathe.
It's all right.
Can't breathe.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?
Sil, I didn't hear from you.
Sil's on the canvas now.
Fucking 100% disaster.
Point is, Tony goes, let's face it,
Somebody's gonna have to step into the breach.
I'm a young man.
Now without the weight,
I'm a healthy man with longevity.
I hear Sil is at St. Barnabas.
My god, what is happening to us around here?
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.
Listen, sweetheart,
You're expecting something, and I can't get into specifics,
And Tony wouldn't want me to, but there are certain people looking over our shoulders right now.
'S okay, Vito.
I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries, like this son of mine.
You gotta trust me on this, hon.
Suspicions get raised if we were to move it to you at this moment.
I got this.
Your ma says now's our moment.
The main thing, when people come to sit with dad,
The doctors want positive talk.
- It helps in his recovery.
Got it.
Oof, madonn'.
He looks terrible.
Uncle Paulie, you can't say stuff like that.
You have to stay positive.
Yeah, it's just nothing prepares you for that.
Uncle Paulie!
Only one person at a time, please.
She's a ballbuster.
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?
Remember, stay positive.
I gotta wear a jock, the doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.
Of course, it could be a lot worse, right?
They gave me an ultrasound, no rupture.
I mean, the good thing is I hurt it doing a major piece of business.
I saw a little action, and the next thing,
I was at the urologist.
Fucking guy tells me I can't expect the same things from my body no more.
I tell you, T, first the eyes, then the teeth.
Next you find out you can't take pissing for granted.
Some joke, huh?
When I was in the service,
I won the chin-ups cup Three weeks in a row.
Fucking beautiful definition, too.
Guy asked me to model for the boxing poster.
He was half a fag, but I was flattered, just the same.
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like an old lady's cunt.
You don't think it's gonna happen to you,
But I'm feeling it, Tony.
Phineas Fogg back in town.
He forgets all the little people.
Hey, Vito,
How's Mr. Soprano doing?
Let's hope he pulls through, huh?
Hi.
So glad you're here.
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be.
That... don't worry about him.
He's harmless.
That fucking agita, T.
I mean, do I blame myself for this life?
The shit that happens,
Like with puss.
Standup one day, F.B.I. Rat fuck the next.
I felt it here, T.
- I felt it right here.
Will you please shut up in there?
I'm sorry.
Yes, the Inn at the Oaks.
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?
Out towards the Beacon.
What is that Beacon anyway?
God damn it!
Shut up!
Shut up in there!
So I said to ma...
Dr. Budraja, stat to room 3.
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!
Out of the way, sir.
What's happening?
Soprano, v-tach on the monitor.
- Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure.
Get a board ready.
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.
Oh my God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?
I don't know what's happening.
One, two, three.
Still v-tach at 210.
150 mg. of amiodaraone.
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.
Cardiovert at 100.
- Dad!
- Stand back.
- All clear.
- Clear.
200.
Stand back.
- All clear.
- Clear.
Excuse me.
Is this the Finnerty reunion?
Hello there.
They're waiting for you.
- Me?
- Of course.
- Has Kevin Finnerty arrived?
- We don't talk like that here.
What do you mean?
Your family's inside.
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.
I don't understand.
- You're going home.
- I am?
Everyone's in there.
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.
I lost my real briefcase.
My whole life was in it.
Don't go, daddy.
What is that?
Briefcases aren't allowed.
No, the voice.
Please, let me take that from you.
Looks like it weighs a ton.
I don't want to.
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.
We love you, daddy.
Don't leave us.
For some reason...
I'm scared.
Well, there's nothing to be scared of.
You can let it go.
Just come say hello.
All right.
Daddy!
Please don't leave us, Daddy.
We love you.
Dad?
His eyes are open.
Daddy, look at me right here.
all right, normal sinus rhythm.
- Pulse and pressure?
Good.
Oh my God!
Thank God.
Thank God.
Hang an amiodaraone drip and send off a set of electrolytes now.
Dad, look, here you are.
So I'm holding his hand, and all of a sudden the machines go bullshit.
You told us, for Christ's sake.
Those fucking doctors, it's their fault.
Skip's gonna make it.
He's conscious.
Oh, thank God!
I got it, honey.
- Fuck took you so long?
- I had to get it together, didn't I?
We gotta get that cut to her now.
Easy, that's a fucking guilty move.
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?
Everybody and his mother was in there talking to him when he was in that coma.
Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?
Maybe he's expecting that money.
He can't talk yet because of the tube that was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider ourselves lucky there.
But we are very happy, aren't we?
Anthony, you had us so worried.
I haven't been to church that much since I quit playing bingo.
What, honey?
I'm dead, right?
No no, you're in the hospital with all of us.
In Newark.
Mr. Soprano, how are you today?
I'm Dr. Vahapsideh.
I'm a neurologist.
How's he doing, sweetheart?
I don't know if we're out of the woods yet, but he's hanging in.
He just passed his first simple mental acuity test, so...
Your strength, that was the difference.
Oh, a little something from us.
Help defray medical costs, rehabilitation.
Jesus, I don't know what to say.
- This is what we do, honey.
- I'd want the same for my Marie.
Or my ma.
We're here if you need anything.
Great fucking news, T.
See you're up and around.
Best.
"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky.
Ojibwe saying."
Indians, right?
Who put this up?
Listen, T, something I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm gonna take another run at the movie business.
I know you haven't liked that in the past,
But I'm going about it in a whole different way.
In fact,
I'm hoping you'll become an investor when you feel a little better,
And I can explain what we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.
We'll own the neg.
That's what they call it.
It means negative.
I'm holding a large ownership position open for you.
I hope you approve.
Actually, frankly... all due respect,
I think you owe me this, as I came to you about Adriana.
You've got him up?
I know how it looks, but he should be upright as much as possible.
I'm gonna leave you two alone.
Thanks for everything.
I don't know how you do it.
That's gotta feel good, huh?
The simple things.
- Where you been?
- hospital, helping carmela.
-the devotion that kid shows.
I just think of My marie, the kids,
In that situation, God forbid.
My ma- who the fuck would take care of her Something happens?
Except sil and you guys.
Colombians knock off At noon.

I can't believe you Know this.

Yeah, why the fuck not?

- what are you talking about?
Like you didn't Put them up to it.
Put who up to what?
God, he was in such A good mood this morning.
I told the nurse that i thought he Moved his eyebrows at around 5:30.
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, i'm gonna Be furious.
Mrs. Soprano, you're really Gonna have to recalibrate
Your expectations At this point.
We can't even maintain His blood pressure At a level that we'd like.
Until his fever dissipates And his white cell Count comes down,
We're a long way From home.
But he's really Fighting.
Mom, he's really strong.
That is true.
Hi, dad.

As writers,
We are all hung up.
But we are also Hung up
On our own hang-up.
We mythologize Our inner narrative.
Take for example, "beowulf."
Who is grendel,
But the habit, The disease.
Ah, fresh casualties In the battle Of the blank page.
Welcome to the writer's guild.
Have a seat.
Take me...
My past as an addict.
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Give me that Fucking fisheye.
I'm offering you A way to wipe your Fucking obligation.
Wasn't me who told you To start gambling again.
I can't write a feature now.
I just landed a staff job.
People are seeing Huge profits with these Digital horror movies.
Douchebags who never Made a film before.
That "saw" thing, 400 grand to make,
Took in 100 mil Worldwide.
I'm 100% well.
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?
You hear this dude?
100% well.
He's a bad boy, huh, With that lingo?
Real fucking Dark character.
My idea is "saw" meets "godfather 2."
Proven track record-- Both genres.
Young wiseguy, assassin, Gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him.
Leave his body parts In dumpsters all
Around the city.
Long story short,
He is put back together by science, Or maybe it's supernatural.
And he gets fucking Payback on everyone Who fucked him over,
Including the cunt He was engaged to.
She was getting porked By his boss the night The hero was killed.

You dislodged his drains.
That was my daughter.
And i can't help but think That physical affection Means something.
They refrigerate This place, huh?
There you go.
what are you still Doing out there?
I got involved In a lawsuit.
- a lawsuit?
- could create Problems later.
what kind of lawsuit?
- also...
- what?
I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.
oh my god!
The doctor said... what d he say?
"mild concussion," He said.
Told me i'd be okay.
that's it.
I'm coming out there.
my mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.
No, don't do that.
are you telling Me everything?
J.t., i want To introduce you
To carmine lupertazzi My co-executive Producer on the project.
Nice to finally meet.
I heard tidbits of what Chris has got in mind-- The genre and so forth.
But, j.t., I gotta warn you,
I'm very hands-on.
I learned that The hard way.
I wanna welcome all Of you to the first Meeting
Of possible investors On this project.
Some of you know I've had nine pictures Under my subspecies,
Four in the "south beach Strumpet" series alone,
Each with 30,000-plus Dvds in print.
That being said, I usually find it Helpful at this stage
To include my Prospective partners And get your inputs
Or notes as we call them.
J.t., you're on.
We've been working on a new Kind of slasher film.
It takes place In the world of...
You know...
Um, the mafia.
It's about A wiseguy with a big mouth
And bigger dreams.
Anyway, they call him "the butcher."
- no, they don't.
- why the fuck not?
Need i remind you Of a certain butcher Out of a.c.?
Right.
Not "butcher." Go on, j.t.
So, right.
He's kind of Outshining his boss.
So the guy has him clipped, But he's still alive
When they cut him up.
He's gonna feel That the next day.
Right.
So at the dump,
His body Reassembles itself,
All except for A hand that got crushed.
So he ties a cleaver
Onto the stump and he goes out To get revenge On everyone,
Especially the boss, which Is a pretty solid role.
Right now it's called "pork store killer."
But i'm thinking...
Just...
"cleaver."
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.
How's he evening Up with anybody?
He's a ghost?
As i understood, A zombie of sorts.
Great title, By the way.
but if they jointed him,
He's not gonna end up All in the same dump.
- and how's that A slasher film?
- what are you talking about?
A slasher.
A couple of kids Naked in a lake.
Certified maniac On the loose, Not a ghost.
Actually, the maniac Is almost always A supernatural force.
Freddy, jason, michael myers From "halloween."
Get the fuck out.
Easy, sil, easy.
He's making a point.
Michael myers is An escaped mental patient.
Jason and freddy, Different kind of movie.
Well, that's the kind We're doing here.
"saw," "the ring"-- They made millions.
And that's not even Including "the godfather" Angle, which we got here.
what if...
They disposed him At stops
That happened To be along the same route?
Then he would all end up In the same dump.
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.
"ghostbusters"-- Another fucking Money machine.
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.
Again.
It's got bechamel on it, So five, six hours out of the Fridge, tops.
Look at her.
That word "plucky," Is that what it means?
Only, when do i get To spend some face time With the skip?
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.
man on tv:
...in this mob family Domestic shooting,
Which some observers Note carries the echoes of the death of soul great Marvin gaye.
as 20-year-old anthony Soprano jr.
Himself
Told our amy kean,
"growing up soprano, it's just plain weird."
Carmela?
- i swear to god, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- what the fuck?
You made a fool of Yourself and our family
On national Fucking television?
I didn't even say That shit.
They totally Misquoted me.
- holy shit.
Well, of course they did.
That's what they do.
Which is why i And everybody else
Told you, "don't talk To the press!"
You're the one Who looked like A total asshole.
Dragging me around like I was five years old.
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.
To your father, to me, To everybody.
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!
Jesus, mel, the hell's Wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
Mom.
It had to happen.
She's fried.
You have any extra compensation For what you've been going through?
Nah, part of the job.
Like they say,
With great power comes Great responsibility.
You know, vito called me "skip" the other day.
Really?
Slip of the tongue no doubt,
But i noticed He didn't correct himself.
See?
If it did become Permanent, your compensation Might be...
- don't go there.
Hi, gab.
I need sil for a second.
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.
This better be Important, bobby.
Got a new baby and two kids In private school.
This arrangement With vito is killing me.
It's 9:30 at night.
Bobby, i don't remember What the fuck it was.
Roseville, This temporary shit.
I need an answer already.
I'm going out of my Fucking mind here.
I'm liable to do Something drastic.
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.
Mornings are better.
I'll come up With a solution.
I don't want you To worry about it.
I must have sounded odd At the supermarket The other day.
See, you're Tony's therapist.
Whether It's appropriate...
How can i help you?
It's about my son.
Both kids, really.
The situation
With the shooting.
I'm very worried About them.
Sure.
It's a very Serious problem,
You know, guns In the home.
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned Our lesson too late.
I immediately removed All the firearms From the house
After the goings-on At tony's uncle's.
Anyway, last night,
I was shrieking At my son,
And i said something Very cruel.
And especially since He's been trying So hard...
How are you doing?
You know, I'm frazzled certainly,
But i am more Worried about them.
They're not kids anymore.
When they were young,
There were certain things We could tell them About tony's life.
You know, lies.
We'll just call Them what they were.
- but now...
- so the issue Isn't just
Guns in the home.
Honestly, i think About my son in front Of those cameras,
Having to vouch For all this.
my daughter And her friends.
They have to face
All these years Of facading.
They do or you do?
The minute i met tony, I knew who that guy was.
On my second date, He brought me and my Mother each a dozen roses
And my father A $200 power drill.
Not the typical story Of young love.
And i don't know If i loved him In spite of it...
Or because of it.
Parents Weren't like that.
And i knew,
Whether consciously or not, I knew that behind That power drill,
There was probably Some guy with A broken arm,
You know, or worse.
And you coped With that, how?
I'd go to my priest, And i would cry,
And say how bad i felt About how my husband Made his money,
But that was bullshit.
Because there are Far bigger crooks Than my husband.
But the kids...
They don't decide Who they're born to.
So now what?
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?
It's all out In the open now, The whole thing.
And them, they're not in grade school anymore.
They become...
The longer they stay With us...
Complicit.
Oh, god.
Putting aside the moral And legal issues,
Clarity can't be A bad thing.
Tony's second night In the coma, i told Him i loved him.
When was the last time I said that?
Are you afraid you aren't Going to feel that way
When he wakes up?
Anthony tells me things are Better between you.
I can't breathe.
- it's all right.
- come here, honey.
Can't breathe.
- it's all right.
Can't breathe.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
- what's going on?
- would you move Your car, please, sir?
Sil, i didn't hear From you.
Sil's on the canvas now.
Fucking 100% disaster.
Point is, tony goes,
Let's face it,
Somebody's gonna have to Step into the breach.
I'm a young man.
Now without the weight,
I'm a healthy man
With longevity.
I hear sil Is at st.
Barnabas.
My god, what is Happening to us Around here?
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.
Listen, sweetheart,
You're expecting Something, and i can't Get into specifics,
And tony wouldn't Want me to,
But there are certain People looking over our Shoulders right now.
'S okay, vito.
I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, i got Bigger worries,
Like this son of mine.
You gotta trust me On this, hon.
Suspicions get raised If we were to move it
To you at this moment.
I got this.
Your ma says Now's our moment.
The main thing, When people come To sit with dad,
The doctors want Positive talk.
- it helps in his recovery.
- got it.
Oof, madonn' He looks terrible.
Uncle paulie, You can't say stuff Like that.
You have to Stay positive.
Yeah, it's just nothing prepares You for that.
Uncle paulie!
Only one person At a time, please.
She's a ballbuster.
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few Minutes, okay?
Remember, stay positive.
I gotta wear a jock, The doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.
Of course, it could Be a lot worse, right?
They gave me An ultrasound, No rupture.
I mean, the good thing is I hurt it doing a major piece Of business.
i saw a little action, And the next thing, i was at the urologist.
Fucking guy tells me i can't expect The same things from my body no more.
i tell you, t, First the eyes, Then the teeth.
Next you find out You can't take pissing For granted.
Some joke, huh?
When i was in the service,
I won the chin-ups cup Three weeks in a row.
Fucking beautiful Definition, too.
Guy asked me to model For the boxing poster.
He was half a fag, But i was flattered, Just the same.
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like An old lady's cunt.
You don't think it's Gonna happen to you,
But i'm feeling it, tony.
Phineas fogg
Back in town.
He forgets All the little people.

Soprano doing?
Let's hope he Pulls through, huh?

"Diary of a Thin Man."
- Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.
The devotion that kid shows.
I just think of my Marie, the kids, in that situation, God forbid.
My ma-- who the fuck would take care of her something happens?
Except Sil and you guys.
Colombians knock off at noon.
Then it's empty.
Manager's unit's down a flight.
- Who's in there?
- Open it.
What the fuck?
Get back!
- Shoot the prick.
- Get the fuck out of the way.
Cocksucking miserable Spic shit!
It's supposed to be empty here daytimes.
Jesus, my fucking balls!
The money!
Fuck, my fucking balls.
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.
Nothing.
Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.
Fuck that.
Close the goddamn door.
This fucking shit for a lousy two Gs?
Oh, Anthony.
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
Cugin'.
I'm gonna go ahead.
What's up?
You were at South Mountain Arena yesterday trying to buy a gun from that asshole in the snack shop.
Who told you that?
We know how you feel, but you can't do this.
I can't believe you know this.
Who told you this?
Look, if my pops was laying in there shot up
- l'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.
- Yeah, why the fuck not?
- Listen to me, I'm your uncle.
Junior's in federal lockup.
No one's getting to him there.
Well, it's difficult, but not impossible.
Trust me.
Your dad does not want you to get involved.
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.
Fuck your girlfriend more.
You little hothead here.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Did you park in emergency or in the garage?
What's going on in there?
They're on rounds or something, Dr. Plepler and the Indian girl.
Hi, did you bring me my sweater?
Your sweater?
Man, Jesus, fuck!
All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?
My problem is I'm old enough to sit with Dad all night, be a messenger boy, bring shit from the house, but I'm too young to deal with the larger issues?
- What are you talking about?
- Like you didn't put them up to it.
Put who up to what?
God, he was in such a good mood this morning.
I told the nurse that I thought he moved his eyebrows at around 5:30.
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, I'm gonna be furious.
Mrs. Soprano, you're really gonna have to recalibrate your expectations at this point.
We can't even maintain his blood pressure at a level that we'd like.
Until his fever dissipates and his white cell count comes down, we're a long way from home.
But he's really fighting.
Mom, he's really strong.
That is true.
Hi, Dad.
Monastery?
Oh!
I, uh... I received these this morning.
Do I really look that much like this guy?
To a certain extent, all Caucasians look alike.
Look, I'm not Finnerty.
I didn't sell you this heating equipment.
But I am kind of worried about what I might have done.
Because you see, yesterday--
Yes, tell us, there's no fraud without a fairy tale.
Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Oh, my.
And I'm in this strange city and--
Please come inside.
I came here because I thought you could help me reach Finnerty.
I have his wallet.
I have his briefcase, but I'm not him.
Excuse the brothers for laughing.
One day we will all die, and then we'll be the same as that tree.
No me, no you.
Be that as it may, we need heat.
We need to find someone who will take responsibility.
Well, I can't do that.
Then the lawsuit proceeds.
Hey, go home and I'll stay.
I just had Chinese food.
- Carmela?
- Dr. Melfi, hi.
How are you?
How are you is more the point.
I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee, or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing I have to have.
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.
I've been calling the hospital and they say that Anthony's stabilized.
That's what they say.
If you or anyone needs anything, to talk or to run interference with the doctors,
- don't hesitate to call.
- l appreciate that.
Thank you.
I have plenty of people around I can talk to.
Of course.
Good luck.
- Morning, Gab. ls he ready?
- He's eating.
We're picking up Mrs. S. at 10:00.
I saw her Tuesday.
How's she holding up, poor thing?
Not so hotso, really.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
You hear about the thing in the old neighborhood?
I'm not busy enough for all this?
Couple of guys left three on the floor in some Colombian laundry.
Thank you.
Two guys we know, huh?
Total bloodbath.
Somebody said a million plus.
What a score.
Fuckin' A.
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.
Listen, don't forget...
Oh, honey, your asthma kicking up?
Springtime.
Pollen's out of control.
- l am so proud of you.
- Acting boss.
I hoped the day would never come.
You've always sold yourself short.
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.
All I ever wanted was to carve out a little piece, enjoy some grandkids.
But how many guys could step into Tony's shoes
- and do the job you're doing?
- You think?
You have such strength in crisis.
Benny told me he feels honored to drive you.
You're firm about what you want without being obnoxious about it.
Sil, have you asked yourself what happens if, God forbid, Tony Soprano doesn't recover?
Listen, Gab, I never talk to you about my work.
And?
I'm gonna tell you something I never told anybody.
Back when Jackie was at the end, he floated the idea of me stepping up to the big seat.
Not Tony, me.
- Really?
- Yeah, but I thought...
- it's not for me.
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it.
I never saw myself as that kind of guy.
I'm more behind the scenes-- advice, strategy.
But here you are, Sil.
The times make the man, honey, not the other way around.
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary--
No change with Tony.
Carmela's in goddamn pieces.
Memo-- get some coffee up to Carmela's house.
Sil, Bobby was making collections up in Roseville again last night.
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.
You forget something, like my cut?
You believe this guy?
You should've lost some weight in that nose, keep it out of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.
It's these fucking flowers right here.
Get this shit out of here.
That was Junior's neighborhood, so now it's mine.
Keep your voice down here.
A va' Napoli-- it was Eugene's going on three years.
And Eugene was with me.
You should have never had it to begin with, except for the beef with the Tastee Freez route.
Junior ruled on it, and it wasn't right then.
This fucking guy.
Easy.
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.
Maybe that's what that miserab' admitted to you.
- l heard five.
- You heard wrong.
What do we do here, Sil?
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?
For the time being, it's Bobby's.
But he's still gonna kick up to you 20/%.
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah, Sil.
What, do you speak Norwegian?
For now.
We'll see how much is there.
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.
Hey, we just need some Irish Spring.
Good morning.
Another one?
Know what I found out yesterday?
What's that?
Thank you.
I was diagnosed actually... with Alzheimer's.
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
My uncle has memory loss.
Maybe it's hereditary.
Someone's probably studying that.
is it possible that I am Kevin Finnerty?
All right, I'll stop.
- Sil.
- What?
You heard about this Orange Street takedown?
The Colombians?
That you?
My guy had the tip.
Should be a nice chunk for everybody.
Everybody?
Carmela, she gets T's cut under the circumstances, correct?
It's your call.
I know it's my fucking call.
Yes, that is the correct thing.
Oh, ladies' room's next door.
I can reach it from here.
Grim fucking scene, that icu.
She's one brave lady.
I was just saying, I'm gonna get T's piece of my half to Sil for her.
- Of the thing.
- Back up there, Bluto.
Your half?
I did all the heavy lifting.
You would never have heard about it without my information.
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.
You said the place was empty.
Doc says I need an ultrasound on my groin and balls.
Sil, you wanna weigh in here?
It breaks half and half.
You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.
I'll have it for you, Sil, the whole 80K.
Ho, ho, ho, 80K?
How's that 20/% of a million?
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.
Fuck it all, Paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.
What's with the fucking accounting out there?
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?
We're looking after Carmela.
- No question.
- Of course.
Sooner than later, Paulie.
I gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?
In a prior incarnation, I would get my load on, blow 20 residuals at the track.
As writers, we are all hung up.
But we are also hung up on our own hang-up.
We mythologize our inner narrative.
Take for example, "Beowulf."
Who is Grendel, but the habit, the disease.
Ah, fresh casualties in the battle of the blank page.
Welcome to the Writer's Guild.
Have a seat.
Take me... my past as an addict.
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Give me that fucking fisheye.
I'm offering you a way to wipe your fucking obligation.
Wasn't me who told you to start gambling again.
I can't write a feature now.
I just landed a staff job.
People are seeing huge profits with these digital horror movies.
Douchebags who never made a film before.
That "Saw" thing, 400 grand to make, took in 100 mil worldwide.
I'm 100/% well.
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?
You hear this dude?
100/% well.
He's a bad boy, huh, with that lingo?
Real fucking dark character.
My idea is "Saw" meets "Godfather 2."
Proven track record-- both genres.
Young wiseguy, assassin, gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him, leave his body parts in dumpsters all around the city.
Long story short, he is put back together by science, or maybe it's supernatural.
And he gets fucking payback on everyone who fucked him over, including the cunt he was engaged to.
She was getting porked by his boss the night the hero was killed.
We'll have a meeting tomorrow.
We hear what you've fleshed out before we go to script.
Bing, 2:30.
Don't make me come look for you.
An entire room full of writers, and you did nothing!
Sir, it's family only in the unit.
I'll be out of your hair in a minute, sister.
I keep telling you people, I'm gonna have to call the hospital administrator.
I wanted to let you know there's a major package coming your way from Paulie and Vito, very significant.
You all have done so much already.
We just found out insurance won't pay for physical therapy.
Bastards.
So thank you.
You wanna come in, say hello?
Uh, sure.
- Hello, Father.
- Silvio.
I have Napoleons, but I also got fruit for a certain party.
Either's good.
The program says sugar after meals
- tells the body you're full.
- When you married my cousin, everybody used to say you looked like John Travolta.
He's almost back to his white suit.
The Bacala question.
Bobby don't have any claim.
I don't know why Sil ruled so half-assed on you. lt's not my style.
He's worried more about taking care of Carmela
- than the actual fucking earners.
- Please.
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds freezing his assets, who do you think's keeping Ginny in butter brickle?
Lucky for me, those last years I was in the can, my kid brother Billy took care of Patty and the grandkids.
Only to have that motherfucking animal Blundetto--
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.
It's hard to forget.
I don't forget.
I forget what we were talking about.
Me too.
What the fuck was it?
Oh, yeah, Jesus.
Carmela.
The thing is--
You want coffee, coz?
If you're already making it.
Hot water and lemon, hon.
Honestly... how can I short Carmela?
Maybe I'm not following you.
I'm as supportive as the next guy, but there's a point.
And what if Tony takes a turn for the worse?
I'm gonna hand her $100,000, and he dies the next day?
Be money down the drain.
It's tempting, but you can't think that way.
You all set now?
Yeah, I'm living it up here.
You still stewing about that money?
Spend some, you'll get over it.
I'll never get over it.
Certain people-- let me tell you.
Oh, come on, not Sil again.
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.
But I still gotta pay tribute to the princess of Little Italy.
- The boss' wife.
What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.
I'm on my way in now.
Yeah, good, and you might want to take care of that thing we talked about.
Which thing?
That big piece of pie you were bringing to the hospital
She's expecting you, so make it happen.
What are you worried about?
I think I know who I'm fucking dealing with here.
I resent that.
You have a problem taking orders from me?
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.
That was my daughter.
And I can't help but think that physical affection means something.
They refrigerate this place, huh?
There you go.
What are you still doing out there?
I got involved in a lawsuit.
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.
What kind of lawsuit?
Hello.
- Also...
- What?
I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.
Oh, my God!
The doctor said...
What did he say?
"Mild concussion," he said.
Told me I'd be okay.
That's it.
I'm coming out there.
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.
No, don't do that.
Are you telling me everything?
JT, I want to introduce you to Carmine Lupertazzi my co-executive producer on the project.
Nice to finally meet. I heard tidbits of what Chris has got in mind-- the genre and so forth.
But, JT, I gotta warn you, I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.
I wanna welcome all of you to the first meeting of possible investors on this project.
Some of you know I've had nine pictures under my subspecies, four in the "South Beach Strumpet" series alone, each with 30,000-plus DVDs in print.
That being said, I usually find it helpful at this stage to include my prospective partners and get your inputs or notes as we call them.
JT, you're on.
Well... we've been working on a new kind of slasher film.
It takes place in the world of... you know... um, the mafia.
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams.
Anyway, they call him "The Butcher."
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?
Need I remind you of a certain butcher out of A.C.?
Right.
Not "Butcher." Go on, JT.
So, right.
He's kind of outshining his boss.
So the guy has him clipped, but he's still alive when they cut him up.
He's gonna feel that the next day.
Right.
So at the dump, his body reassembles itself, all except for a hand that got crushed.
So he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone, especially the boss, which is a pretty solid role.
Right now it's called "Pork Store Killer."
But I'm thinking... just...
"Cleaver."
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.
How's he evening up with anybody?
He's a ghost?
As I understood, a zombie of sorts.
Great title, by the way.
But if they jointed him, he's not gonna end up all in the same dump.
- And how's that a slasher film?
- What are you talking about?
A slasher.
A couple of kids naked in a lake.
Certified maniac on the loose, not a ghost.
Actually, the maniac is almost always a supernatural force.
Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers from "Halloween."
Get the fuck out.
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.
Michael Myers is an escaped mental patient.
Jason and Freddy, different kind of movie.
Well, that's the kind we're doing here.
"Saw," "The Ring"-- they made millions.
And that's not even including
"The Godfather" angle, which we got here.
What if... they disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route?
Then he would all end up in the same dump.
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.
"Ghostbusters"-- another fucking money machine.
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.
Again.
It's got bechamel on it, so five, six hours out of the fridge, tops.
Thank you.
- Hey.
- Howdy.
Look at her.
That word "plucky," is that what it means?
Only, when do I get to spend some face time with the skip?
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.
...in this mob family domestic shooting, which some observers note carries the echoes of the death of soul great
Marvin Gaye.
As 20-year-old Anthony Soprano Jr. himself told our Amy Kean, "Growing up Soprano, it's just plain weird."
You just wanna bite it!
Big Lots!
What's your deal today?
Carmela?
I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- What the fuck?
- You made a fool of yourself and our family on national fucking television?
I didn't even say that shit.
They totally misquoted me.
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did.
That's what they do, which is why I and everybody else told you, "Don't talk to the press!"
You're the one who looked like a total asshole.
Dragging me around like I was five years old.
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.
To your father, to me, to everybody.
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!
Jesus, Mel, the hell's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
Mom.
It had to happen.
She's fried.
You have any extra compensation for what you've been going through?
Nah, part of the job.
Like they say, with great power comes great responsibility.
You know, Vito called me "skip" the other day.
Really?
Slip of the tongue, no doubt, but I noticed he didn't correct himself.
See?
If it did become permanent,
- your compensation might be...
- Don't go there.
Hi, Gab.
I need Sil for a second.
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.
This better be important, Bobby.
Got a new baby and two kids in private school.
This arrangement with Vito is killing me.
It's 9:30 at night.
Bobby, I don't remember what the fuck it was.
Roseville, this temporary shit.
I need an answer already.
I'm going out of my fucking mind here.
I'm liable to do something drastic.
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.
Mornings are better.
I'll come up with a solution.
I don't want you to worry about it.
I must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day.
See, you're Tony's therapist.
Whether it's appropriate...
How can I help you?
It's about my son.
Both kids, really.
The situation with the shooting.
I'm very worried about them.
Sure.
It's a very serious problem, you know, guns in the home.
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned our lesson too late.
I immediately removed all the firearms from the house after the goings-on at Tony's uncle's.
Anyway, last night, I was shrieking at my son, and I said something very cruel.
And especially since he's been trying so hard...
How are you doing?
You know, I'm frazzled certainly, but I am more worried about them.
They're not kids anymore.
When they were young, there were certain things we could tell them about Tony's life.
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just guns in the home.
Honestly, I think about my son in front of those cameras, having to vouch for all this.
My daughter and her friends.
They have to face all these years of facading.
They do or you do?
The minute I met Tony, I knew who that guy was.
On my second date, he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a $200 power drill.
Not the typical story of young love.
And I don't know if I loved him in spite of it... or because of it.
My parents weren't like that.
And I knew, whether consciously or not, I knew that behind that power drill, there was probably some guy with a broken arm, you know, or worse.
And you coped with that, how?
I'd go to my priest, and I would cry, and say how bad I felt about how my husband made his money, but that was bullshit.
Because there are far bigger crooks than my husband.
But the kids... they don't decide who they're born to.
So now what?
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?
It's all out in the open now, the whole thing.
And them, they're not in grade school anymore.
They become... the longer they stay with us...
Complicit.
Oh, God.
Putting aside the moral and legal issues, clarity can't be a bad thing.
Yes.
Tony's second night in the coma, I told him I loved him.
When was the last time I said that?
Are you afraid you aren't going to feel that way when he wakes up?
Anthony tells me things have been... better between you.
Come here, honey.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
I can't breathe.
- lt's all right.
- Come here, honey.
Can't breathe.
Can't breathe.
It's okay, honey.
You're gonna be okay.
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?
Sil, I didn't hear from you.
Sil's on the canvas now.
Fucking 100/% disaster.
Point is, Tony goes, let's face it, somebody's gonna have to step into the breach.
I'm a young man.
Now without the weight, I'm a healthy man with longevity.
I hear Sil is at St. Barnabas.
My God, what is happening to us around here?
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.
Listen, sweetheart, you're expecting something, and I can't get into specifics, and Tony wouldn't want me to, but there are certain people looking over our shoulders right now.
It's okay, Vito.
I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries, like this son of mine.
You gotta trust me on this, hon.
Suspicions get raised if we were to move it to you at this moment.
I got this.
Your ma says now's our moment.
The main thing, when people come to sit with dad, the doctors want positive talk.
- lt helps in his recovery.
- Got it.
Oof, Madonn' he looks terrible.
Uncle Paulie, you can't say stuff like that.
You have to stay positive.
Yeah, it's just nothing prepares you for that.
Uncle Paulie!
Only one person at a time, please.
She's a ballbuster.
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?
Remember, stay positive.
I gotta wear a jock, the doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.
Of course, it could be a lot worse, right?
They gave me an ultrasound, no rupture.
I mean, the good thing is I hurt it doing a major piece of business.
I saw a little action, and the next thing, I was at the urologist.
Fucking guy tells me I can't expect the same things from my body no more.
I tell you, T, first the eyes, then the teeth.
Next you find out you can't take pissing for granted.
Some joke, huh?
When I was in the service, I won the chin-ups cup three weeks in a row.
Fucking beautiful definition, too.
Guy asked me to model for the boxing poster.
He was half a fag, but I was flattered just the same.
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like an old lady's cunt.
You don't think it's gonna happen to you, but I'm feeling it, Tony.
Phineas Fogg back in town.
He forgets all the little people.
Hey, Vito, how's Mr. Soprano doing?
Let's hope he pulls through, huh?
Hi.
So glad you're here.
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be.
That-- don't worry about him.
He's harmless.
That fucking agita, T.
I mean, do I blame myself for this life?
The shit that happens, like with Puss.
Standup one day, fbi rat fuck the next.
I felt it here, T.
- l felt it right here.
- Will you please shut up in there?
I'm sorry.
Yes, the lnn at the Oaks.
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?
Out towards the beacon.
What is that beacon anyway?
Oh.
God damn it!
Shut up!
Shut up in there!
So I said to Ma--
What the fuck?
Dr. Budraja, stat to room 3.
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!
- Out of the way, sir.
- Oh, my God!
What's happening?
Soprano, V-tach on the monitor.
- Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure.
Get a board ready.
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.
Oh my God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?
I don't know what's happening.
One, two, three.
Oh, my God!
Still V-tach at 210.
150 mg of amiodaraone.
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.
Cardiovert at 100.
- Dad!
- Stand back.
- Daddy!
- All clear.
Clear.
- 200.
- Stand back.
- All clear.
- Clear.
Excuse me.
is this the Finnerty reunion?
Hello there.
They're waiting for you.
- Me?
- Of course.
Has Kevin Finnerty arrived?
We don't talk like that here.
What do you mean?
Your family's inside.
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.
I don't understand.
- You're going home.
- l am?
Everyone's in there.
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.
I lost my real briefcase.
My whole life was in it.
Don't go, Daddy.
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.
- No, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- l don't want to.
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.
We love you, Daddy.
Don't leave us.
For some reason... I'm scared.
Well, there's nothing to be scared of.
You can let it go.
Just come say hello.
All right.
Daddy!
Please don't leave us, Daddy.
We love you.
Dad?
His eyes are open.
Daddy, look at me right here.
All right, normal sinus rhythm.
- Pulse and pressure?
- Good.
Oh my God!
Thank God.
Thank God.
Hang an amiodaraone drip and send off a set of electrolytes now.
Dad, look, here you are.
So I'm holding his hand, and all of a sudden the machines go bullshit.
You told us, for Christ's sake.
Those fucking doctors, it's their fault.
Skip's gonna make it.
He's conscious.
Oh, thank God!
I got it, honey.
Fuck took you so long?
I had to get it together, didn't I?
We gotta get that cut to her now.
Easy, that's a fucking guilty move.
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?
Everybody and his mother was in there talking to him when he was in that coma.
Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?
Maybe he's expecting that money.
Jesus Christ.
He can't talk yet because of the tube that was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider ourselves lucky there.
But we are very happy, aren't we?
Anthony, you had us so worried.
I haven't been to church that much since I quit playing bingo.
What, honey?
I'm dead, right?
No no, you're in the hospital with all of us.
In Newark.
Mr. Soprano, how are you today?
I'm Dr. Vahapsideh.
I'm a neurologist.
How's he doing, sweetheart?
I don't know if we're out of the woods yet, but he's hanging in.
He just passed his first simple mental acuity test, so...
Your strength, that was the difference.
Oh, a little something from us.
Help defray medical costs, rehabilitation.
Jesus, I don't know what to say.
This is what we do, honey.
I'd want the same for my Marie.
Or my ma.
We're here if you need anything.
Great fucking news, T.
See you're up and around.
Best.
"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky.
Ojibwe saying."
Indians, right?
Who put this up?
Listen, T, something I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm gonna take another run at the movie business.
I know you haven't liked that in the past, but I'm going about it in a whole different way.
In fact, I'm hoping you'll become an investor when you feel a little better, and I can explain what we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.
We'll own the neg.
That's what they call it.
It means negative.
I'm holding a large ownership position open for you.
I hope you approve.
Actually, frankly... all due respect, I think you owe me this, as I came to you about Adriana.
You've got him up?
I know how it looks, but he should be upright as much as possible.
- l'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.
Okay.
I don't know how you do it.
That's gotta feel good, huh?
The simple things.
- Diary Of A Thin Man.
Where you been?
- Hospital, helping Carmela.
The devotion that kid shows.
I just think of my Marie, the kids, in that situation, God forbid.
My ma, who the fuck would take care of her if something happens?
Except Sil and you guys.
Colombians knock off at noon.
Then it's empty.
Manager's unit's down a flight.
- Who's in there?
- Open it.
- What the fuck?
- Get back!
- Shoot the prick!
- Get the fuck out of the way!
- Cocksucking, miserable Spic shit!
- It's supposed to be empty here daytimes.
Jesus, my fucking balls!
The money!
Fuck!
My fucking balls!
- Oogatz here.
- The freeze.
Nothing.
- Let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise we made.
- Fuck that.
Close the goddamn door!
This fucking shit for a lousy two Gs?
Anthony.
- Hi, Uncle Bobby.
- Hiya, sweetheart.
Cugin'.
I'm gonna go ahead.
- What's up?
- You were at South Mountain Arena yesterday trying to buy a gun in the snack shop.
- Who told you that?
- We know how you feel, but you can't do this.
I can't believe you know this.
Who told you?
If my pops was laying in there shot up, I'd be thinking the same thing.
- But you can't go there.
- Yeah, why the fuck not?
I'm your uncle.
Junior's in federal lock-up.
No one's getting to him there.
Well, it's difficult, but not impossible.
Trust me, your dad does not want you to get involved.
You gotta channel that rage elsewheres.
Golden Gloves.
- What?
- Dumbbells or something.
Fuck your girlfriend more.
You little hothead here!
- Did you park in emergency or in the garage?
- What's going on in there?
They're on rounds or something, Dr Plepler and the Indian girl.
- Hi, did you bring me my sweater?
- Your sweater?
- Man, Jesus, fuck!
- All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?
I'm old enough to sit with Dad, bring shit from the house, but too young for the larger issues?
- What are you talking about?
- Like you didn't put them up to it.
Put who up to what?
God, he was in such a good mood this morning.
I told the nurse I thought he moved his eyebrows at around 5.30.
Did she pass that along?
If not, I'm gonna be furious.
Mrs Soprano, you're gonna have to recalibrate your expectations at this point.
We can't even maintain his blood pressure at a level that we'd like.
Until his fever dissipates and his white cell count comes down, we're a long way from home, but he's really fighting.
Mom, he's really strong.
That is true.
Hi, Dad.
Monastery?
I...
I received these this morning.
- Do I really look that much like this guy?
- To a certain extent, all Caucasians look alike.
All right, look, I'm not Finnerty.
I didn't sell you this heating equipment.
But I am kind of worried about what I might have done.
- Because, you see, yesterday...
- Tell us.
There's no fraud without a fairy tale.
Yesterday, I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
- My.
- And I'm in this strange city and...
Please, come inside.
I came here because I thought you could help me reach Finnerty.
I have his wallet, I have his briefcase, but I'm not him.
Excuse the brothers for laughing.
One day we will all die and then we'll be the same as that tree.
No me, no you.
Be that as it may, we need heat.
We need to find someone who will take responsibility.
- I can't do that.
- Then the lawsuit proceeds.
Go home and I'll stay.
I just had Chinese food.
- Carmela?
- Dr Melfi, hi.
How are you?
- How are you, is more the point.
- I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed to get coffee or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing I have to have.
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.
I've been calling the hospital and they say that Anthony's stabilised.
- That's what they say.
- If you or anyone needs anything, to talk or to run interference with the doctors, don't hesitate to call.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
I have plenty of people around I can talk to.
Of course.
Good luck.
- Morning, Gab.
Is he ready?
- He's eating.
- We're picking up Mrs S at ten.
- I saw her Tuesday.
- How's she holding up, poor thing?
- Not so hotso, really.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.
Hear about the thing in the old neighbourhood?
I'm not busy enough for all this?
Couple of guys left three on the floor in some Colombian laundry.
Thank you.
- Two guys we know?
- Total bloodbath.
- Somebody said a million plus.
What a score!
- Fuckin' A.
- Sil, Benny says you have to go.
- Yeah, all right.
Listen, don't forget...
Honey, your asthma kicking up?
Springtime.
Pollen's out of control.
- I am so proud of you.
- Acting boss?
- I hoped the day would never come.
- You've always sold yourself short.
You know, that's not what I mean.
You know me.
All I ever wanted was to carve out a little piece, enjoy some grandkids.
How many guys could step into Tony's shoes and do the job you're doing?
- You think?
- You have such strength in crisis.
Benny feels honoured to drive you.
You're firm about what you want without being obnoxious about it.
Sil, have you asked yourself what happens if, God forbid, Tony Soprano doesn't recover?
- Gab, I never talk to you about my work.
- And?
I'm gonna tell you something I never told anybody.
Back when Jackie was at the end, he floated the idea of me stepping up to the big seat.
- Not Tony, me.
- Really?
- Yeah, but I thought, "It's not for me."
- Still, you wouldn't sneeze at it?
I never saw myself as that kind of guy.
I'm more behind the scenes.
Advice, strategy.
But here you are, Sil.
The times make the man, honey, not the other way around.
Asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's other ancillary...
- No change with Tony.
- Carmela's in goddamn pieces.
Memo.
Get some coffee up to Carmela's house.
Bobby was making collections up in Roseville again last night.
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's resolve this.
- How's the skip doing?
- Same.
You forget something?
Like my cut.
Can you believe this guy?
Lose weight on that nose.
Keep it out of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.
It's these fucking flowers right here.
Get this shit out of here.
That was Junior's neighbourhood so now it's mine.
Keep your voice down here.
It was Eugene's for three years and he was with me.
He should've never had it, except for the beef with the Tastee Freez route.
- Junior ruled on it and it wasn't right then.
- This fucking guy!
Easy.
- How much we talking about?
- Three Gs a week.
Maybe that's what that he admitted to you.
I heard five.
You heard wrong.
What do we do here, Sil?
- Here's the thing.
- What, skip?
For the time being, it's Bobby's, but he's still gonna kick up to you 20%
- How long's for the time being?
- Yeah.
What, do you speak Norwegian?
For now.
We'll see how much is there.
Hi, everyone.
My God, you poor thing.
Hey, we just need some Irish Spring.
Good morning.
Another one?
- Know what I found out yesterday?
- What's that?
Thank you.
I was diagnosed, actually... with Alzheimer's.
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, my uncle has memory loss.
Maybe it's hereditary.
Someone's probably studying that.
Is it possible that I am Kevin Finnerty?
All right, I'll stop.
Sil?
What?
Heard about this Orange Street takedown?
- The Colombians?
That you?
- My guy had the tip.
- Should be a nice chunk for everybody.
- Everybody?
Carmela.
She gets T's cut under the circumstances, correct?
It's your call.
I know it's my fucking call.
Yes, that is the correct thing.
Ladies' room's next door!
I can reach it from here!
Grim fucking scene, that ICU.
She's one brave lady.
I was just saying, I'm gonna get T's piece of my half to Sil for her.
- Of the thing.
- Back up, Bluto.
- Your half?
I did all the heavy lifting.
- You'd have never heard about it without me!
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.
You said the place was empty.
Doc says I need an ultrasound on my groin and balls.
Sil.
You wanna weigh in here?
It breaks half and half.
You both kick Tony's to me to deal with.
I'll have it for you, Sil, the whole 80K.
80K?
How's that 20% of a million?
Have a cookie, you're delirious.
It was 750, tops.
Fuck it all, Paulie, Tommy cased that shithole!
What's with the fucking accounting out there?
That's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?
We're looking after Carmela.
- No question.
- Of course.
Sooner than later, Paulie.
I gotta piss first.
You want half of that, too?
In a prior incarnation, I would get my load on, blow 20 residuals at the track.
As writers, we are all hung up.
But we are also hung up on our own hang-up.
We mythologise our inner narrative.
Take, for example, Beowulf.
Who is Grendel?
But the habit, the disease...
Fresh casualties in the battle of the blank page!
Welcome to the Writers' Guild.
Have a seat.
Take me.
My past as an addict...
Get the fuck up!
Come on!
Give me that fucking fisheye!
I'm offering you a way to wipe your obligation!
- I didn't tell you to start gambling again!
- I can't write a feature.
I just landed a staff job.
People are seeing huge profits with these digital horror movies.
Douchebags who never made a film before.
That Saw thing, 400 grand to make, took in 100 mil worldwide.
I'm 100% well?
I deliver this script, I owe you nothing?
You hear this dude? "100% well." He's a bad boy, with that lingo?
Real fucking dark character.
My idea is Saw meets Godfather II.
Proven track record, both genres.
Young wiseguy, assassin, gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him, leave his body parts in dumpsters all around the city.
Long story short, he is put back together by science or maybe it's supernatural.
And he gets fucking payback on everyone who fucked him over, including the cunt he was engaged to.
She was getting porked by his boss the night the hero was killed.
We'll have a meeting tomorrow.
We'll hear what you fleshed out before we go to script.
Bing, 2.30.
Don't make me come look for you.
An entire room full of writers and you did nothing!
- Sir, it's family only in the unit.
- I'll be out of your hair in a minute.
I'm gonna have to call the hospital administrator.
There's a major package coming your way from Paulie and Vito.
Very significant.
You all have done so much already.
We just found out insurance won't pay for physical therapy.
Bastards!
So thank you.
You wanna come in, say hello?
Sure.
Hello, Father.
I have Napoleons, but I also got fruit for a certain party.
Either's good.
The programme says sugar after meals tells the body you're full.
When you married my cousin, everybody used to say you looked like John Travolta.
He's almost back to his white suit!
The Bacala question.
Bobby don't have any claim.
I don't know why Sil ruled so half-assed on you.
It's not my style.
He's worried more about Carmela than the fucking earners.
Please.
With Johnny awaiting trial and the feds freezing his assets, who's keeping Ginny in Butter Brickle?
Lucky for me, those last years I was in the can, my kid brother Billy took care of Patty and the grandkids.
Only to have that motherfucking animal Blundetto...
Don't do it to yourself, Philly.
It's hard to forget.
I don't forget.
- I forget what we were talking about.
- Me, too.
What the fuck was it?
Yeah, Jesus.
Carmela.
The thing is...
- You want coffee, cuz?
- If you're already making it.
Hot water and lemon, hon.
Honestly... how can I short Carmela?
- Maybe I'm not following you.
- I'm as supportive as the next guy.
But there's a point.
And what if Tony takes a turn for the worse?
I'm gonna hand her $100,000 and he dies the next day?
- Be money down the drain.
- It's tempting, but you can't think that way.
You all set now?
Yeah, I'm living it up here.
Still stewing about that money?
Spend some, you'll get over it.
I'll never get over it.
- Certain people, let me tell you...
- Come on, not Sil again.
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.
But I still gotta pay tribute to the princess of Little Italy.
- The boss's wife.
What are you gonna do?
- Fuck her.
I'm on my way in now.
- And take care of that thing we talked about.
- Which thing?
That big piece of pie you were bringing to the hospital.
Make it happen.
- What are you worried about?
- I know who I'm fucking dealing with.
- I resent that.
- You have a problem taking orders from me?
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.
Don't get in bed with him again.
You dislodged his drains.
That was my daughter.
I can't help but think that physical affection means something.
They refrigerate this place?
There you go.
- What are you still doing out there?
- I got involved in a lawsuit.
- A lawsuit?
- Could create problems later.
What kind of lawsuit?
Hello?
- Also...
- What?
- I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.
- My God
The doctor said...
What did he say?
Mild concussion, he said.
- Told me I'd be OK.
- That's it, I'm coming out there.
My mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.
No, don't do that.
Are you telling me everything?
I want to introduce you to Carmine Lupertazzi, my co-executive producer on the project.
Nice to finally meet.
I heard titbits of what Chris has in mind, the genre and so forth.
But, JT, I gotta warn you, I'm very hands-on.
I learned that the hard way.
I wanna welcome all of you to the first meeting of possible investors on this project.
Some of you know I've had nine pictures under my subspecies.
Four in the South Beach Strumpet series alone, each with 30,000-plus DVDs in print.
I usually find it helpful at this stage to include my prospective partners and get your inputs, or notes, as we call them.
JT, you're on.
Well... we've been working on a new kind of slasher film.
It takes place in the world of... you know... the Mafia.
It's about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams.
Anyway, they call him The Butcher and...
- No, they don't.
- Why the fuck not?
Need I remind you of a certain butcher out of AC?
Right.
Not Butcher.
Go on, JT.
So, right...
He's kind of outshining his boss.
So the guy has him clipped, but he's still alive when they cut him up.
He's gonna feel that the next day!
Right.
So at the dump, his body reassembles itself.
All except for a hand that got crushed so he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone, especially the boss, which is a pretty solid role.
Right now it's called Pork Store Killer, but I'm thinking... just...
Cleaver.
- I'm confused.
You said he's dead.
- How's he evening up with anybody?
- He's a ghost?
- As I understood, a zombie of sorts.
Great title, by the way.
But if they jointed him, he's not gonna end up all in the same dump.
- How's that a slasher film?
- What are you talkin' about?
The slasher.
Couple of kids naked in a lake.
Certified maniac on the loose, not a ghost.
Actually, the maniac is almost always a supernatural force.
- Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers.
- Get the fuck out!
Easy, Sil, easy.
He's making a point.
Michael Myers is an escaped mental patient.
Jason and Freddy - different kind of movie.
That's the kind we're doing here.
Saw, The Ring, they made millions.
That's not including the Godfather angle, which we got here.
What if... they disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route?
Then he would all end up in the same dump.
But he's a ghost?
I don't know.
Ghostbusters.
Another fucking money machine!
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.
Again.
It's got bĆ©chamel on it so five, six hours out of the fridge, tops.
- Thank you.
- Howdy.
Look at her.
That word plucky, is that what it means?
When do I get to spend time with the skip?
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.
...in this mob family domestic shooting, which some observers note carries echoes of the death of...
As 20-year-old Anthony Soprano Junior himself told our Amy Kean...
"Growing up Soprano, it's just plain weird."
- You just wanna bite it!
- Big Lots!
What's your deal today?
Carmela?
- I swear, I'll fucking kill you!
- What the fuck?
You made a fool of yourself and our family on national fucking television?
I didn't even say that shit.
They totally misquoted me.
- Holy shit.
- Well, of course they did.
That's what they do!
Which is why I and everybody else told you, don't talk to the press!
You're the one who looked like a total asshole, dragging me around like I was five!
You're a cross to bear, that's all you are.
To your father, to me, to everybody!
Fuck this!
All right, fuck it all!
- Jesus, Mel, the hell's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?
- What's wrong with me?
- Mom...
Had to happen.
She's fried.
You have any extra compensation for what you've been going through?
Nah, part of the job.
Like they say, "with great power comes great responsibility."
You know, Vito called me "skip" the other day.
Really?
Slip of the tongue, no doubt, but I noticed he didn't correct himself.
See?
If it did become permanent, your compensation might be...
Don't go there.
Hi, Gab.
I need Sil for a second.
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.
This better be important, Bobby.
Got a new baby and two kids in private school.
This arrangement with Vito is killing me.
It's 9.30 at night.
Bobby, I don't remember what the fuck it was.
Roseville, this temporary shit, I need an answer already!
I'm going out of my fucking mind!
I'm liable to do something drastic!
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.
Mornings are better.
I'll come up with a solution.
I don't want you to worry about it.
I must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day.
See, you're Tony's therapist.
- Whether it's appropriate...
- How can I help you?
It's about my son.
Well, both kids, really.
The situation... with the shooting, I'm very worried about them.
Sure.
It's a very serious problem.
You know, guns in the home.
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned our lesson too late.
I removed all the firearms from the house after the goings-on at Tony's uncle's.
Anyway, last night, I was shrieking at my son... and I said something...
I said something very cruel.
And especially since he's been trying so hard.
How are you doing?
You know, I'm frazzled, certainly, but I am more worried about them.
They're not kids any more.
When they were young, there were certain things we could tell them about Tony's life.
You know, lies.
We'll just call them what they were.
- But now...
- So the issue isn't just guns in the home.
I think about my son in front of those cameras, having to vouch for all of this.
My daughter and her friends.
They have to face all these years of facading.
They do or you do?
The minute I met Tony, I knew who that guy was.
On my second date, he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a $200 power drill.
Not the typical story of young love.
And I don't know if I loved him in spite of it... or because of it.
My parents weren't like that.
And I knew, whether consciously or not, I knew that behind that power drill, there was probably some guy with a broken arm, you know, or worse.
And you coped with that, how?
I'd go to my priest and I would cry and say how bad I felt about how my husband made his money, but that was bullshit.
Because there are far bigger crooks than my husband.
But the kids, they don't decide who they're born to.
So now what?
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?
It's all out in the open now, the whole thing.
And them, they're not in grade school any more, they become...
The longer they stay with us...
Complicit.
God.
Putting aside the moral and legal issues... clarity can't be a bad thing.
Yes.
Tony's second night in the coma, I told him I loved him.
When was the last time I said that?
Are you afraid you aren't going to feel that way when he wakes up?
Anthony tells me things have been...
better between you.
- Can't breathe.
- It's OK, honey.
You're gonna be OK.
I can't breathe.
- It's all right.
- Can't breathe.
Can't breathe, can't breathe!
It's OK, honey.
You're gonna be OK.
- What's going on?
- Would you move your car, please, sir?
Sil, I didn't hear from you.
- Sil's on the canvas now.
- Fucking 100% disaster.
Point is, Tony goes, let's face it, somebody's gonna have to step into the breach.
I'm a young man and now, without the weight,
I'm a healthy man with longevity.
I hear Sil is at St Barnabas.
My God, what is happening to us around here?
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.
Listen, sweetheart, I know you're expecting something and I can't get into specifics,
Tony wouldn't want me to.
But certain people are looking over our shoulders right now.
It's OK, Vito, I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.
Like you said, I got bigger worries.
Like this son of mine.
You gotta trust me on this, hon.
Suspicions get raised if we were to move it to you at this moment.
I got this.
Your ma says now's our moment.
The main thing, when people come to sit with Dad, the doctors want positive talk.
- It helps in his recovery.
- Got it.
- He looks terrible!
- Uncle Paulie, you can't say stuff like that.
- We have to stay positive.
- Yeah, it's just, nothing prepares you for that.
Uncle Paulie!
Only one person at a time, please.
She's a ballbuster.
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few minutes, OK?
Remember, stay positive.
I gotta wear a jock, the doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.
Course, it could be a lot worse, right?
They gave me an ultrasound, no rupture.
I mean, the good thing is I hurt it doing a major piece of business.
I saw a little action and the next thing, I was at the urologist.
Fucking guy tells me I can't expect the same things from my body no more.
I tell you, T, first the eyes, then the teeth.
Next you find out you can't take pissing for granted.
Some joke, huh?
When I was in the service, I won the chin-ups cup three weeks in a row.
Fucking beautiful definition, too!
Guy asked me to model for the boxing poster.
He was half a fag, but I was flattered just the same.
Now look at this.
Fucking wrinkles like an old lady's cunt.
You don't think it's gonna happen to you, but I'm feeling it, Tone.
Phineas Fogg back in town.
He forgets all the little people.
Hey, Vito, how's Mr Soprano doing?
Let's hope he pulls through, huh?
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds be.
That...
Don't worry about him.
He's harmless.
That fucking agita, T. I mean, do I blame myself for this life?
The shit that happens, like with Puss.
Stand-up one day, FBI rat-fuck the next.
I felt it here, T. I felt it right here.
Will you please shut up in there?
I'm sorry.
Yes, the Inn at the Oaks.
Left on Jamboree Boulevard?
Out towards the beacon.
What is that beacon, anyway?
God damn it!
Shut up!
Shut up in...
So I said to Ma...
What the fuck?
Dr Budraja, stat to room three.
Nurse, don't leave!
Help!
- Out of the way, sir.
- My God, what's happening?
- V-tach on the monitor.
Thready pulse.
- Take his pressure.
- 80 palp.
- All right, let's bag him.
My God, is he dying?
Where's my mom?
I don't know what's happening!
- One, two, three.
- Dr Budraja, stat.
- My God!
- Still V-tach at 210.
150 mg of amiodaraone.
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.
Cardiovert at 100.
- Dad!
- Stand back.
- Daddy!
- All clear.
Clear.
- 200.
- Stand back.
- All clear.
- Clear.
- Excuse me.
Is this the Finnerty reunion?
- Hello, there.
They're waiting for you.
- Me?
- Of course.
- Has Kevin Finnerty arrived?
- We don't talk like that.
- What do you mean?
- Your family's inside.
- What family?
- They're here to welcome you.
- I don't understand.
- You're going home.
I am?
Everyone's in there.
- You can't bring business in there.
- Daddy.
I lost my real briefcase.
My whole life was in it.
Don't go, Daddy.
- What is that?
- Briefcases aren't allowed.
- No, no, the voice.
- Please, let me take that from you.
- Looks like it weighs a ton.
- I don't want to.
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.
We love you, Daddy.
Don't leave us.
For some reason...
- I'm scared.
- Nothing to be scared of.
You can let it go.
Just come say hello.
All right.
Daddy!
Please don't leave us, Daddy.
We love you.
Dad?
His eyes are open.
Daddy, look at me right here.
- Normal sinus rhythm.
Pulse and pressure?
- Good.
My God!
Thank God.
Thank God!
Hang an amiodaraone drip and send off a set of electrolytes now.
Dad, look, here you are.
So I'm holding his hand and all of a sudden the machines go bullshit!
- You told us, for Christ's sake.
- Those fucking doctors, it's their fault...
Skip's gonna make it, he's conscious!
Thank God!
I got it, honey.
- What the fuck took you so long?
- I had to get it together, didn't I?
- We gotta get that cut to her now.
- Easy, that's a fucking guilty move.
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?
Everybody and his mother was talking to him when he was in that coma.
Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?
Maybe he's expecting that money.
Jesus Christ.
He can't talk yet because of the tube that was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider ourselves lucky!
But we are very happy, aren't we?
Anthony, you had us so worried.
I haven't been to church that much since I quit playing bingo!
What, honey?
I'm dead, right?
No.
No, you're in the hospital with all of us.
In Newark.
Mr Soprano, how are you today?
I'm Dr Vahapsideh.
I'm a neurologist.
- How's he doing, sweetheart?
- Not out of the woods, but he's hanging in.
He just passed his first simple mental acuity test, so...
Your strength, that was the difference.
A little something from us.
- Help defray medical costs, rehabilitation.
- Jesus, I don't know what to say.
- This is what we do, honey.
- I'd want the same for my Marie.
Or my ma.
We're here if you need anything.
Great fucking news, T.
To see you up and around.
The best.
"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself...
"and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky.
"Ojibwe saying." Indians, right?
Who put this up?
Listen, T, something I wanted to talk to you about.
I'm gonna take another run at the movie business.
I know you haven't liked that in the past, but I'm going about it in a whole different way.
In fact, I'm hoping you'll become an investor when you feel better and I can explain what we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.
We'll own the neg.
That's what they call it.
It means negative.
I'm holding a large ownership position open for you.
I hope you approve.
Actually... frankly... all due respect...
I think you owe me this.
Because I came to you about Adriana.
- You've got him up?
- I know how it looks.
But he should be upright as much as possible.
- I'm gonna leave you two alone.
- Thanks for everything.
I don't know how you do it.
That's gotta feel good, huh?

I DON'T THINK HE PLAYS ON YOUR TEAM.
BUT HE'S OVERWEIGHT.
AND POOFS ARE RARELY BEEFY.
I WROTE A PIECE ABOUT THAT IN A MAGAZINE ONCE.
DID YOU?
MM-HMM.
CARRIE, DO YOU HAVE THE NEW LIZA MINNELLI CD?
- MMM.
OKAY, AND SCRATCH MY LAST COMMENT.
CHEERS.
- CHEERS.
HOW'S THAT NEW CAMPAIGN COMING ALONG?
CARRIE TELLS ME IT'S BEEN BRUTAL.
- OH, UH, MORE FOR YOU, YEAH?
- YES.
RED OR WHITE?
I'LL HAVE RED.
ACTUALLY, I'LL HAVE WHITE.
OKAY.
YOU KNOW, I'LL HAVE BOTH.
ALL RIGHT.
UM, WELL, JULIA BARTLETT IS NOT AN EASYGOING CLIENT.
- SHE'S THE WORST.
- IF CARRIE WASN'T ON THE ACCOUNT, I'D PULL MY HAIR OUT.
OH, HONEY.
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GETTING A PROMOTION BEFORE ME.
[ Chuckles ]
- OOH, YOU SNEAKY LITTLE BITCH.
- SO, UM, WHAT DO YOU DO?
I'M DOING MY, UH, SURGICAL RESIDENCY AT MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL,
WITH A SPECIALTY IN, UH-- [ Imitates Heartbeat ] HEART TRANSPLANTS.
- OH, FABULOUS.
- THANKS.
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO BEEN TOGETHER?
- US TWO?
- MM-HMM.
- THIRTY YEARS.
- [ Laughing ]
- I'M SORRY.
DID I MISS SOMETHING?
- WELL, YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
- NO.
- GRAY'S MY SISTER.
OH, MY GOD!
NO!
ICK!
NO, I'M--
I JUST-
- I THOUGHT THAT YOU TWO WERE AN ITEM.
WELL, I JUST--
WHAT?
THESE-THESE TWO?
WELL, YEAH.
YOU SEEM SO--
SO?
I DON'T KNOW.
SO TOGETHER, I GUESS.
HEY, WHAT'D I MISS?
- UM, SHE THINKS WE'RE TOGETHER.
- [ Gray ] LIKE "TOGETHER" TOGETHER?
LIKE SCREWING EACH OTHER TOGETHER.
UGH!
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONE TO THINK THAT, ELAINE.
- LET ME TELL YOU.
- WHAT?
- THEY'RE VERY CODEPENDENT.
- [ Together ] WE ARE NOT!
- COME ON.
- YOU RARELY SPEND A MINUTE APART.
BUT IF THAT'S--
WE DO TOO.
ALL DAY AT WORK, WE NEVER SEE EACH OTHER.
HOW ABOUT THAT-- REMEMBER?
YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING?
I'VE EVEN SEEN THEM SHARE THE SAME TOOTHBRUSH.
- [ Together ] ONE TIME.
- OH, ICK.
- ONE TIME IS-
- IT'S CREEPY.
- I-
- LISTEN.
I THINK THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS CHARMING.
- THANK YOU.
- HAVE YOU EVER FRENCH-KISSED?
[ Laughing ] THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
WE'RE GONNA END UP LIKE THE DELANY SISTERS.
WHO?
YOU KNOW, THE SISTERS THAT WERE 103 AND 105, AND THEY NEVER GOT MARRIED,
AND THEY JUST DID YOGA AND HEADSTANDS TOGETHER EVERY DAY.
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO.
DO HEADSTANDS TOGETHER.
GET THE CIRCULATION FLOWING.
IT'D BE GOOD FOR US.
I'M SERIOUS.
WE NEED TO VENTURE OUT.
TO WHERE?
WHEN?
I'M TOO BUSY TO DATE, AND I'M NOT GOIN' TO BARS.
THE GIRLS THERE, ALL THEY DO IS THEY TALK ABOUT HOW FAT THEY ARE.
THEY'RE NOT FAT.
THEY'RE NOT FAT GIRLS.
THEY'RE THIN GIRLS THAT THINK THEY'RE FAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT?
I WANT A GIRL WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO EAT A HOT FUDGE SUNDAE, OKAY,
AND HAVE NO GUILT ATTACHED, THAT'S WHAT I WANT.
CAN'T YOU MEET A CUTE INTERN AT THE HOSPITAL?
[ Imitates Buzzer ] WRONG.
CAN'T DO IT.
TOO DANGEROUS.
YOU CAN'T HAVE SEXUAL TENSION AND CUT AN ARTERY.
IT'S AWKWARD.
OKAY, I'LL LOOK FOR A HOT FUDGE SUNDAE GIRL FOR YOU, AND YOU LOOK FOR A GUY FOR ME...
WHO IS DEEP AND SENSITIVE AND FUNNY.
OKAY.
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T THINK GINGER ROGERS IS ONE OF THE SPICE GIRLS.
OKAY.
SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T CONSIDER GOING TO FLORIDA TRAVELING.
ALL RIGHT.
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT AFRAID OF ETHIOPIAN FOOD.
[ Groans ]
SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T THINK TRUFFAUT'S A KIND OF MUSHROOM.
SOMEONE WHO WOULD CALL ME AN HOUR AFTER OUR FIRST DATE AND SAY...
"I AM CRAZY ABOUT YOU, AND I'M COUNTING THE MINUTES UNTIL I COULD SEE YOU AGAIN."
[ Sighs ]
[ With Scots Accent ] THAT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY, DARLIN'.
ETHIOPIAN FOOD, I-I LIKE THAT.
EATIN' WITH YOUR FINGERS, THINGS.
IT'S QUITE FESTIVE.

HEY, JIMMY.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
HI, TOMMY.
HI.
OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
HEY, JENNY, I PROMISE I'LL WRITE MY DAYTIMES.
I TOTALLY FORGOT.
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.
MY WEIGHT WATCHERS MEETING WENT OVER, AND IT WAS TOO GOOD TO LEAVE.
WHY DO YOU STILL GO TO THOSE MEETINGS?
YOU HAVE AN AWESOME FIGURE.
OH, THANKS.
DERECK THINKS THAT I HAVE FLABBY THIGHS.
HE HAS NERVE.
HE HAS A RECEDING HAIRLINE.
DID YOU MENTION THAT TO HIM?
- DID YOU TELL HIM TO GO TO RECEDING HAIRLINE MEETINGS?
- YEAH, I KNOW.
RIGHT?
BUT TRUST ME.
THE ENTERTAINMENT FACTOR ALONE IS WORTH IT.
TODAY, IT WAS SO CRAZY.
THERE WAS THIS WOMAN WHO WAS ALL MAD AT HER HUSBAND FOR NOT LETTING HER HAVE DESSERT.
SO SHE BREAKS INTO THE SOHO CHOCOLATE FACTORY...
AND TRIED TO DROWN HERSELF IN A VAT OF CHOCOLATE.
NO.
YES.
- LIKE AUGUSTUS GLOOP INWILLY WONKA?
- EXACTLY.
IT'S LIKE THE CUCKOO SHOW.

THAT WAS SO GOOD.
- IT'S SO COOL AND KITSCH.
KITSCH IS IN.
- YOU THINK IT WAS GOOD?
I TOLD LANA ABOUT IT.
SHE SAID IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.
- SHE SAYS JULIA BARTLETT HATES KITSCH.
- LANA?
DON'T LISTEN TO LANA.
SHE'S MR. PHILLIPS'S SECRETARY.
WHAT DOES SHE KNOW?
I DO THINK SHE DOES A LOT MORE THAN JUST TYPE FOR HIM.
- GIVE IT UP.
- OKAY.
YOU WANT TO HEAR THIS?
I HEARD SOME HOT GOSSIP.
- YEAH.
- LANA-
- WAIT, I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY'S LISTENING--
LANA GOES TO KEMIKO, MY PEDICURIST,
AND TOLD HER, WHO THEN TOLD MRS. KARAQUESH, MY DRY CLEANER,
- SHE AND MR. PHILLIPS HAVE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER FOR MONTHS.
- NO!
I KNOW IT'S ACCURATE GOSSIP 'CAUSE MRS. KARAQUESH NEVER GOSSIPS.
- OH, MY GOD!
- EVER.
- HEY, LANA!
- HEY!
HEY!
WHAT'S UP?
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE LUNCH WITH US TODAY?
OH, I'D LOVE TO, BUT MR. PHILLIPS ASKED ME TO DO SOME RESEARCH FOR HIM, SO--
OH, REALLY?

THIS IS JUST ONE OF THEM.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
THAT WAS CRAP.
J-JULIA, JUST A SECOND.
I DON'T KNOW, SYDNEY.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS KIND OF THERAPY IS WORKING FOR ME.
HOW COME EVERY ROAD I TAKE TURNS OUT TO BE A DEAD END?
WHY COULDN'T IT BE A FORK?
I LIKE FORKS.
AT LEAST WITH A FORK THERE'S A CHOICE-
- RIGHT OR LEFT OR EAST OR WEST...
OR THIS WAY OR THAT WAY.
MM-HMM.
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU ALWAYS REACH THESE DEAD ENDS?
OOH!
YOU SEE, GUTTER BALL.
THAT'S MY LIFE-- A BUNCH OF GUTTER BALLS.
WELL, THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE...
OF WHY HAVING THERAPY IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IS SO IMPORTANT.
LOOK AT THE DEEP SYMBOLISM IN THAT GUTTER BALL.

ANOTHER WORD FOR HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT GOING ON A DATE.
CLOSED FOR REPAIRS.
THAT'S NOT ONE WORD.
I KNOW.
BUT I CAN'T HELP IT.
IT'S A WEIRD THING, BUT I SEE MYSELF AS THIS CHARMING HOTEL...
THAT'S BEAUTIFULLY ROMANTIC AND...
WONDERFUL ON THE OUTSIDE,
BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT JUST NEEDS A TON OF RENOVATIONS.
HENCE, CLOSED FOR REPAIRS.
NICE ANALOGY.
WHAT KINDS OF RENOVATIONS?
GETTING A PROMOTION AT WORK, PERFECTING THE TANGO,
DISOWNING MY MOTHER, GETTING LIPOSUCTION UNDER MY CHIN.
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN CHIN FAT.
UH, I THINK YOU NEED TO...
LET THE IDEA OF SHARING YOUR LIFE WITH SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOUR BROTHER...
ENTER YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS.
BUT HOW CAN I BE CONSCIOUS OF SOMETHING THAT I'M UNCONSCIOUS OF?
IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T DATE.
I'VE HAD PLENTY OF BOYFRIENDS.
MAYBE I'M JUST IN A DRY SPELL.
LET'S TRY SOMETHING.
HOW ABOUT KEEPING THE HOTEL CLOSED,
BUT KEEPING THE VERANDA OPEN FOR COCKTAILS?
WELL, I REALLY LIKE VERANDAS.
I LOVE TRELLISES, AND I LOVE ARBORETUMS.
AREN'T ARBORETUMS BEAUTIFUL?
AND HOUSES WITH THE PORCH OUT FRONT--
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
'CAUSE WE ARE OUT OF TIME TODAY,

- NO.
- YES!

MM-HMM.
MY NICKNAME WAS "CONNECT THE DOTS."
[ Both Laughing ]
I HAVE A TOAST.
TO MY SOON-TO-BE SISTER-IN-LAW AND MY NEWFOUND FRIEND--
THAT'S A BATHING SUIT YOU'RE WEARING?
YOU'RE NOT EMBARRASSED, ARE YOU?
ZITS OR NO ZITS, MY ASS HASN'T LOOKED THAT GOOD SINCE I WAS 17.
I'M NOT TAKING OFF A THING.
I HAVE A SECRET I WANT TO SHARE, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD.
YOU SHOULD.
YOU CAN'T TELL SAM.
SCOUT'S HONOR.
THOUGH I DID GET KICKED OUT OF THE BROWNIES FOR STEALING MONEY OUT OF MY COOKIE ACCOUNT.
SAM AND I HAVEN'T HAD RELATIONS YET.
"RELATIONS"?
RELATIONS MEANS MY AUNT BETTY.
RELATIONS AS IN INTERCOURSE.
I DECIDED TO WAIT, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS A MISTAKE.
I MEAN, WHAT IF HE'S TOO BIG OR IF I'M TOO SMALL OR--
T.M.I. HASN'T ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU TO TEST DRIVE A CAR BEFORE YOU BUY IT?
[ Laughs ]
[ Cheering, Applause ]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WELL,
I LOVE VEGAS, AND I AM CERTAIN THAT VEGAS LOVES ME,
BECAUSE I LOST A BUNDLE ON THE SLOTS LAST NIGHT.
IS THIS FIVE OR SIX?
I DON'T KNOW.
I LOST COUNT.
BUT I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
WE'RE JUST GETTING WARMED UP.
OH, GEEZ.

OOH!

WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND TOO PLEASANT.
I'M SORRY.

I CANCELED A SESSION WITH SOMEONE TODAY BECAUSE YOU SAID IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.
IT IS.
WELL, THEN?
TAKE A DEEP BREATH-- [ Inhales ]
[ Exhales ] AND TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
THREE SHORT BREATHS, ONE LONG.
THAT'S WHAT SAM AND I DID WHEN WE WERE KIDS...
- AND THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT.
- FINE.
THEN DO THAT.
- [ Whispering ] I THINK I'M GAY.
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- I CAN'T SAY IT AGAIN.
- DID YOU JUST SAY "I THINK I'M GAY"?
IT'S LIKE THIS.
FOR YEARS, I THOUGHT I WAS CONTENT BEING SINGLE,
AND I WASN'T REALLY INTERESTED IN A RELATIONSHIP.
I THOUGHT THAT WHEN MR. RIGHT CAME INTO MY LIFE, HE JUST WOULD.
HE-
- HE WOULDN'T NEED SOME FANCY INVITATION.
HE WOULD JUST ARRIVE.
AND THEN I REALIZED THAT IT'S NOT MR. RIGHT I'M WAITING FOR.
IT'S MRS. RIGHT.
OH.
AND I THINK I FOUND HER.
AND I KISSED HER-- [ Sighs ]
AND I THINK SHE KISSED ME BACK, BUT I'M NOT SURE,
'CAUSE I NEVER KISSED A GIRL BEFORE, AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE RULES ARE.
BUT I KNOW THAT I LIKED IT.
AND I THINK I LIKE HER.
NOW I FEEL NAUSEOUS AGAIN.
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU FEEL NAUSEOUS?
DO YOU THINK YOU COMMITTED SOME TERRIBLE SIN JUST BECAUSE YOU KISSED A GIRL?
WHY?
IF YOU'RE TWO CONSENTING ADULTS, WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT THAT?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CONSENTED.
SHE WAS VERY DRUNK.
OH, SO YOU BELIEVE YOU FORCED HER TO KISS YOU?
NO.
NO, NOT AT ALL.
SHE KISSED ME.
OKAY, I'M CONFUSED NOW.
SO AM I.
Y-YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.
ONE DAY YOU THINK YOU'RE ONE THING,
AND THE NEXT DAY YOU REALIZE YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE.
I FEEL LIKE I'M DOROTHY INTHE WIZARD OF OZ.
I'M IN THIS NEW LAND AND I WANT TO GET HOME,
BUT SOMETHING IS TELLING ME MAYBE THIS IS MY HOME.
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T CLICK MY HEELS THREE TIMES.
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST STAY HERE AND BE NAUSEOUS WITH THE MUNCHKINS.
WHAT SCARES YOU MOST ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING?
THAT I'LL LOSE SAM AND HE'LL NEVER TALK TO ME AGAIN.
WELL, WHY WOULD SAM EVEN CARE?
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE UPSET I KISSED HIS WIFE.
- WHOA!
- [ Gasps ]
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- OH, GOD.
Y-YOU'RE LOOKING PALE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME DEEP BREATHS.
- I'M FINE.
- WELL, I'M NOT.
I'M A WRECK.
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN THREE DAYS.
I'VE TAKEN 42 SHOWERS.
I'VE BEEN TO A CHURCH, A TEMPLE AND A MOSQUE, BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS.
THE MORMON PLACE WOULDN'T LET ME IN.
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS ON LEVEL GROUND.
YOU'RE NOT THINKING STRAIGHT.
- NO KIDDING.
- WE NEED TO GET DOWN.
LISTEN TO ME.
I'M LISTENING.
YOU'RE NOT GAY.
I'M NOT?
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
BECAUSE IT'S TEXTBOOK.
INSANITY?
NO.
WHAT YOU DID WAS NORMAL.
IT WAS ALMOST PREDICTABLE.
YOU WERE SO JEALOUS OF CHARLIE...
THAT YOU SUBCONSCIOUSLY TRIED TO SABOTAGE SAM'S MARRIAGE.
READ MY LIPS.
YOU ARE NOT GAY.
I'M NOT?
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
ARE YOU SURE?
YES!
BECAUSE MY MIND IS REELING WITH FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS,
AND MY HEART'S TELLING ME-- ACTUALLY, OUR TIME IS UP FOR TODAY.
NOW, FORGET ABOUT SAM AND GET OUT THERE AND DATE.
YOUR HOTEL IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.
GOT IT?
NOW, I WILL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK AT THE BATTING CAGES AT CHELSEA PIERS.
NICE CLIMB.
[ Exhales ]
MY HOTEL IS OPEN.
I HAVE SUITES, JUNIOR SUITES, DELUXE ACCOMMODATIONS AVAILABLE.
HEY.

THAT'S A GREAT OUTFIT.
THANKS.

"THAT OUTFIT LOOKS VERY BECOMING ON YOU."
WELL, THANKS TO YOU AND YOUR POPS.

THAT COFFEE SMELLS GREAT.
I'M ON THIS NO-CAFFEINE KICK RIGHT NOW,
BUT I STILL FIND MYSELF HANGING AROUND STARBUCKS TRYING TO GET AN AROMA BUZZ.

IT'S ONE-THIRD COFFEE, ONE-THIRD COCOA, ONE-THIRD CHAI,
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF STEAMED SOY AND CINNAMON AND A LITTLE BIT OF NUTMEG.
WOW.
THAT'S A NEW ONE.
[ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ]
[ Inaudible ]
WHAT WAS THAT?
MMM-
- NOTHING.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT?
WOW.
THAT-- THAT TOOK GUTS.
[ Laughs ]
WOULD YOU?
SURE.
WHAT TIME?
UM, RAOUL'S AT 10:00.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU THEN.
[ Elevator Bell Dings ] GREAT.
ARE YOU GOING UP?
DOWN.
OKAY.
SEE YOU TONIGHT.
OH!
ARE-ARE YOU OKAY?
- [ Chuckles ] - [ Indistinct ]
IS ANYTHING SPRAINED?
BROKEN?
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL A DOCTOR.
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.
ARE YOU SURE?
YES.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT?
SAY 8:00 AT RAOUL'S?
ME?
MM-HMM.
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M A PRETTY BUSY GUY.
I'M USUALLY BOOKED UP EVERY NIGHT.
I'D HAVE TO-- I'D HAVE TO CHECK MY SCHEDULE.
YEAH!
YEAH, I THINK I CAN DO THAT.
GREAT.
[ Sighs ] COOL.
[ Bell Dings ]
[ Sam ] HEY, GRAY.
GRAY GHOST.
YOU NEED A LITTLE HELP?
OH, YOU DID SOME SERIOUS-- OH!
DAMAGE.
HOLY SMOKES.
LOOK AT YOU.
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?
I GOT A COUPLE OF DATES TONIGHT.
A COUPLE?
YEAH.
I GOT A 8:00 DINNER WITH ONE, AND I GOT A 10:00 DINNER WITH THE OTHER.
THAT'S GREAT.
DID YOU GET THAT RASH YOU ALWAYS GET BEFORE YOU GO OUT?
NO.
WHY DID YOU REMIND ME?
JUST TRYING TO HELP.
LOOK, IS NOW A GOOD TIME TO TALK?
ABOUT WHAT?
I WANTED TO CHECK IN, SEE WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU MIGHT GET YOUR OWN PLACE.
I KNOW WE GET ALONG GREAT, AND CHARLIE LOVES YOU,
BUT WE ARE NEWLYWEDS SO I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT-- [ Clucks Tongue ]
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO FIND A RENT-CONTROLLED PLACE IN THE CITY?
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO MOVE?
ONE, THE LEASE IS IN MY NAME, AND, TWO, I FOUND THE APARTMENT.
'CAUSE A 90-YEAR-OLD WOMAN DIED ON YOUR SHIFT AT THE HOSPITAL.
HER BODY WASN'T EVEN COLD BEFORE YOU WERE CALLING THE SUPER, CLAIMING TO BE HER NEPHEW.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU COMPLAINING.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU WENT TO HER FUNERAL.
THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M SENSITIVE AND NOT MEAN LIKE YOU.
YOU CAN'T KICK ME OUT.
I DECORATED THE WHOLE APARTMENT.
I EVEN GROUTED THE BATHROOM TILES MYSELF.
I'M JUST SAYING MAYBE YOU SHOULD START LOOKING, THAT'S ALL.
I HATE YOU!
I REALLY DO.
HEY, HEY!
HEY!
I CAN HEAR YOU GUYS YELLING FROM AROUND THE BLOCK.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I WASN'T YELLING.
SHE WAS YELLING.
I WAS.
I HATE HIM!
WHY?
WHAT DID HE DO NOW?
ME?
- THAT'S A LITTLE PRESUMPTUOUS, DON'T YOU THINK?
- HE'S KICKING ME OUT.
SAM, I THOUGHT WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS.
WE'LL GET OUR OWN PLACE ONCE I GET A FULL-TIME POSITION AT THE AQUARIUM.
UNTIL THEN, IT'S FINE.
I ACTUALLY KIND OF LIKE IT.
YOU DO?
YEAH.
IT'S FUN.
I LOVE LIVING WITH THE BOTH OF YOU.
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- SHIT.
[ Chuckles ]
SHE HAS A COUPLE OF DATES TONIGHT,
AND HER CHEST JUST BROKE OUT INTO HIVES.
OH.
HEY.
I THINK-- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER ME,
BUT I THINK YOU DROVE ME BEFORE.
OH, YOU'RE NOT VERY FOND OF FLORIDA,
AND WHEN YOU REFER TO GINGER'S COMPANION,
YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SUSHI OR WASABI.
NOT BAD.
[ Chuckles ]
WHERE'S THAT FUNNY ACCENT OF YOURS FROM?
OH,
A FUNNY PLACE CALLED SCOTLAND.
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO NEW YORK?
FAME AND FORTUNE, OF COURSE.
HMM.
HOW'S THAT GOIN'?
WELL, LET'S SEE.
I'VE HAD TWO AUDITIONS SO FAR.
THE FIRST ONE WAS FOR THE LEAD IN A TAMPON SPOT--
THE ROLE OF THE TAMPON, OF COURSE--
AND THEN, UH, THE SECOND ONE WAS A VOICE-OVER...
FOR A PEST-CONTROL INFOMERCIAL.
AND I DIDN'T GET THAT PART.
THEY, UH-
- THEY SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT ROACHES DIDN'T HAVE ACCENTS.
I BEGGED TO DIFFER, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM ARGUMENTATIVE.
HMM.
[ Sniffing ] DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT CONTAGIOUS.
I'M NOT WORRIED.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I AM A MESS.
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A MESS.
YOU LOOK AS CUTE AS A BUTTON.
AND BUTTONS AREN'T MESSY.
WELL, LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING.
YOU KNOW, BACK HOME IN SCOTLAND, I WAS CAPTAIN OF THE LOCAL FOOTBALL TEAM.
OH?
YEAH.
AND ALL MY MATES USED TO COME TO ME WITH THEIR PROBLEMS.
THEY SAID I WAS PRETTY GOOD.
SO--
I'M ALL EARS IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE FROM THE OUTSIDE, YOU KNOW?
HMM.
THAT'S SWEET, BUT IT WOULD TAKE ALL NIGHT TO TACKLE MY LAUNDRY LIST.
THANKS.
KEEP THE CHANGE.
THANK YOU.
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
AND I'M COUNTING THE MINUTES UNTIL I SEE YOU AGAIN.
HEY, THAT'S MY LINE.
I'M AN ACTOR.
WE GET PAID TO STEAL OTHER PEOPLE'S LINES.
SEE YA.
UH, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH--
COULD I GIVE YOU A LIFT HOME TONIGHT?
I COULD COME AND FETCH YOU ABOUT, SAY, JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
NO CHARGE.
- OKAY.
- GREAT.
EXCUSE ME.
CAN I GET ANOTHER DOUBLE VODKA MARTINI?
SURE.
WITH THREE OLIVES AND A TINY SPLASH OF VERMOUTH.
- OKAY.
- AND JUST A HINT-
- A HINT-- OF SALT ON THE RIM.
YEAH.
A LITTLE WATER, PLEASE, ALSO?
OF COURSE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR THE SPECIALS?
PLEASE.
YEAH.
FANTASTIC.
TONIGHT WE HAVE A BRAISED LAMB SHANK...
MARINATED IN A ROSEMARY-LIME SAUCE.
THAT'S SERVED WITH A CREAMED PUMPKIN SQUASH.
WE ALSO HAVE A GRILLED HALIBUT STEAK...
IN A SOY-TAMARI LEMON-ZEST GLAZE.
AND THAT COMES WITH GRILLED SEAWEED AND AN ORANGE AND ALMOND SALAD.
DO WE KNOW WHAT WE'D LIKE?
YES.
I'LL HAVE THE HALIBUT WITH THE PUMPKIN SQUASH AND THE ROSEMARY-LIME SAUCE...
AND NOT THE SOY-TAMARI-LEMON STUFF.
OH, THAT DOES SOUND GOOD, DOESN'T IT?
YEAH, THEY DON'T COME TOGETHER.
- WELL, CAN YOU MAKE 'EM COME TOGETHER?
- I'LL TRY.
TRY HARD.
AND I'LL HAVE THE DUCK CONFIT.
EXCELLENT.
COMING RIGHT UP.
CONRAD, I'M IMPRESSED.
YOU DUKED THE GUY.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD IT IN YOU.
THERE'S A LOT IN ME THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
I'M A BURNIN' SEX MACHINE JUST WAITIN' TO BE USED AND ABUSED BY YOU.
THE HARDER, THE BETTER.
[ Barks ] CHECK, PLEASE.

[ Gray ] HOW?
I DON'T KNOW.
SO WAIT.
LET ME JUST GET THIS STRAIGHT.

THEN THE ANXIOUS PAIN IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH WHEN I CAN'T WAIT...
FOR THE NIGHT TO END, BUT I'M FEELING NO PAIN, NO LULLS.
YEAH, I'M FEELING RATHER PAINLESS AND "LULL-LESS" MYSELF.
CHEERS TO THAT.
CHEERS.
BUT, UH, I DO WANT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.
OH, NO.
HONESTY ON THE FIRST DATE.
THAT HAS A BAD RING TO IT.
[ Chuckles ]
SEE, I WAS SO FLATTERED WITH THE WAY YOU ASKED ME OUT IN THE ELEVATOR.
- I KNOW.
DON'T TELL ME.
YOU'RE MARRIED.
- ACTUALLY, I'M NOT MARRIED,
BUT STEWART AND I HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER FOR YEARS.
- YEAH.
-STEWART--
AM I A MORON OR WHAT?
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
I CAN'T HELP IT.
I'M HOPELESS.
YOU'RE NOT.

SOME FRESH AIR AND SOME PERSPECTIVE.

AH.
THAT'S EASY.
YOU'RE GONNA MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE,

NOTHING.

[ Both Chuckling ]
MMM.
SHE'S THE BEST.
STRONG, INDEPENDENT, FEISTY.
WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHO ELSE?
QUEEN OPRAH.
OPRAH.
OPRAH THE GREAT.
OPRAH-
- I LOVE HER.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I'M OBSESSED WITH HER?
LIKE, I THINK SHE IS SO GREAT THAT SHE SHOULD START HER OWN RELIGION.
I LOVE HER SO MUCH THAT IF SHE AND STEADMAN...
COULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN AND NEEDED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP,
I WOULD SURROGATE A CHILD FOR THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT, I WOULD HAVE OPRAH'S BABY.
THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE HER.
WOW.
THAT'S A LOT OF LOVE.
LAST NIGHT I WAS SO INSPIRED AFTER WATCHING HER SHOW ABOUT LOVING YOUR BODY THAT--
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID TODAY?
- WHAT?
- I QUIT WEIGHT WATCHERS.
- GET OUT!
YEAH!
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
I QUIT.
FERGIE, "SMERGIE."
I HATE FIBER.
I LIKE MALLOMARS.
AND IF DERECK ISN'T GOING TO LOVE ME FOR THE TINY AMOUNT...
OF CELLULITE I HAVE ON THE BACK OF MY THIGHS,
- THEN FUCK HIM-- SCREW THAT GUY.
- YEAH.
THIS IS THE PACKAGE, OKAY?
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME UNDER THE WRAPPING.
THIS IS THE PACKAGE.
NO EXCHANGES, NO RETURNS.
YES.
RIGHT?
HOT!
THANK YOU.
I MEAN, WHY DOES OUR SOCIETY PUSH US...
TO BE PERPETUALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH WHO WE ARE?
IT'S SO MESSED UP.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?
HERE.
THIS IS WHY.
"BOOST YOUR BUTTOCKS IN FIVE DAYS."
"LUSCIOUS LIPOSUCTION." "THE FLAWLESS FACE-LIFT."
THAT'S WHY.
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
WE NEED TO STOP LETTING SOCIETY AND-AND MEDIA...
AND OUR RELIGIOUS LEADERS DELEGATE WHO WE ARE.
YOU'RE AMAZING, AND I'M EVEN MORE AMAZING,
AND ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T GET IT CAN GO SCREW THEMSELVES!

WHAT IS IT?
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I'M LISTENING.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST GET PREPPED FOR SURGERY--
MAYBE YOU SHOULD PERFORM THE SURGERY.
I'LL COME BACK LATER.

I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
IT'S NOT EASY.
IT'S REALLY MAJOR, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THREE SHORT BREATHS AND ONE-- ONE LONG.

I'M GAY.
WHAT?
AS IN MARVIN.
WHAT?
AS IN, TAKE THE "R" OUT OF "GRAY," AND-
- BINGO!
OH.
[ Exhales ] [ Exhales ]
THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT ABOUT IT IS GREAT?
- IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE COMING OUT.
- DON'T TELL ME YOU KNEW.
[ Chuckling ] GRAY, OF COURSE I KNEW.
HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW?
I'M SMARTER THAN YOU.
I'VE KNOWN SINCE SECOND GRADE, WHEN YOU HAD A CRUSH ON MRS. WERTHEIMER...
AND TRIED TO LOOK UP HER SKIRT.
SHE WAS CUTE, WASN'T SHE?
TELL YOU, I'M PROUD OF YOU, GRAY.
THIS IS A BIG MOMENT.
THIS IS HUGE.
IT'S BIG, ALL RIGHT,
BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER THING I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU, AND IT'S EVEN BIGGER.
BIGGER.
YEAH.
IT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE BIGGER THAN THIS.
WELL, I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU SEE IT.
WHAT IS IT?
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.
WHO?
HER.
WHO HER?
YOUR WIFE.
WHOSE WIFE?
YOURS.
I'M IN LOVE WITH CHARLIE.
- IS THIS YOUR IDEA OF A BAD JOKE?
- I WOULD NEVER JOKE ABOUT IT.
I LOVE THE WAY SHE TALKED AND WALKED AND LOOKED AND FELT,
BUT IT REALLY KICKED IN AFTER WE KISSED.
KISSED?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, KISSED?
ARE YOU SAYING YOU KISSED MY WIFE?
ONLY ONCE, AND TECHNICALLY SHE WASN'T YOUR WIFE.
IT WAS THE NIGHT BEFORE YOUR WEDDING.
I'M SORRY.
LOOK, I NEVER EXPECTED THIS TO HAPPEN.
JUST TELL ME OFF.
JUST YELL AT ME.
I KNOW I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.
I'M A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PERSON.
GRAY, I WANT YOU TO PACK UP YOUR SHIT AND GET IT OUT OF THE APARTMENT...
BY THE TIME I GET HOME TONIGHT, BECAUSE WE'RE DONE.
ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE DONE.
[ Charlie ] THERE HAS TO BE A REASON.
WHY WOULD SHE MOVE OUT WITHOUT TALKING TO US ABOUT IT...
OR EVEN TELLING US WHERE SHE WAS GOING?
WHY ARE YOU SO CONCERNED?
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO MEAN ANYTHING.
YOU SEEM OBSESSED ABOUT MY SISTER, THAT'S ALL.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
IS IT?
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT HER.
AREN'T YOU HAPPY WE'LL HAVE THE PLACE TO OURSELVES?
OF COURSE I'M HAPPY.
ALL RIGHT THEN.
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE.
WHAT'S THE ISSUE?
DID YOU GUYS GET IN A FIGHT OR SOMETHING?
WHAT AREN'T YOU TELLING ME?
I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING.
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO TELL ME?
LIKE WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU TELL ME.
SAM, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.
YOU LOVE YOUR SISTER.
YES, I LOVE MY SISTER.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
DO YOU LOVE MY SISTER?
OF COURSE I LOVE YOUR SISTER.

DO YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT WE SPENT TOGETHER IN LAS VEGAS BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED TO SAM?

I'M SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYONE SAYING IT'S NORMAL, IT'S TYPICAL, IT'S ORDINARY.
I DON'T FEEL ANY OF THOSE THINGS.
WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- LONELY.
- WHY?
BECAUSE I'M NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN THE STREET...
HOLDING HANDS WITH MY PARTNER...
WITHOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD GIVING US A LOOK.
I MAY NEVER HAVE THE WEDDING THAT I ONCE DREAMED OF,
AND I MAY NEVER HAVE CHILDREN,
AND ONE DAY, WHEN I DIE,
PEOPLE WILL NEVER GIVE AS MUCH RESPECT TO MY GRIEVING LOVER...
AS IF SHE WERE MY HUSBAND.

IT'S NOT AS IF YOU MADE A CHOICE.

THAT'S WHAT TERRIFIES ME.
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO BE SOMEONE ELSE.
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE KIDS--
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT SIX--
AND DAD CAME HOME TO TELL MOM HE WAS LEAVING HER FOR MRS. ROSEMONT.
YEAH.
REMEMBER WE STAYED IN THE CLOSET ALL NIGHT,
JUST CUDDLED UP LIKE TWO LITTLE MICE AND...
LISTENED TO THEIR WHOLE FIGHT.
I WAS...
SO ANGRY.
I WAS...
HURT.

I WAS MAD, AND I WANTED TO GO OUT THERE AND KICK HIS ASS,

BUT YOU SAID IT WAS GONNA BE OKAY,
THAT DAD WAS NOT GONNA LIVE A LIE,
THAT HE WAS GONNA TRY AND BE HAPPY,
AND THAT EVERYONE DESERVED TO BE HAPPY.
I SAID THAT?

I WAS SO PROFOUND.
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO NICE TO ME?
YOU SHOULD HATE ME.
FOR WHAT?
FOR HAVING GOOD TASTE?
YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

FOR ME.
NOT SO GREAT FOR YOU.
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY FOR THIS ARE YOU?
MM-MMM.

YOU CAN'T EXPECT THE FIRST GIRL THAT YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH...
TO LOVE YOU BACK.
THAT'S-
- THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.
THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF SETTLING DOWN WHEN YOU WERE AGE 12.

Come back.
- No.

Turn around.
- Hey, hey!
You're the best.
You're amazing.
What do you say?
Beers on me.
Cold beers on me.
- Let's go!
Wonderful.
Weren't theywonderful?
Come on.
Keep it going, Gray.
- Hey.
- Help!
- Okay.
- Help.
Ohh.
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?
- Yeah.
Mmm.
- What do you got?
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.
- And chicken.
- Good.
- And fish.
- And fish.
- And tofu.
- Good.
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great.
We got tempeh.
Then I got the regular essentials, like asparagus and lettuce.
- I got it.
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay?
Let's--
Hello?
Hey, Carrie.
Who?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, honey.
- Dinner?
No.
We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.
- We go out.
I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.
Do you want something fruity or full-bodied and do--
Okay.
Okay.
What-
- Californian, French, Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span--
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have toyell.
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.
That is amazing.
Oh, my God.
Carrie.
Doyou believe this?
Ta-da!
I would like to say something.
To Carrie and Dereck and their lovely friends.
Oh, my goodness.
I don't know what it means, but it sounded beautiful.
- It's a fake accent.
He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?
- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.
And poofs are rarely beefy.
I wrote a piece about that in a magazine once.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Carrie, do you have the new Liza Minnelli CD?
- Mmm.
Okay., andscratch my.Iast comment.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.
- Oh, uh, more fory.ou,y.eah?
- Yes.
- Red orwhite?
- I'll have red.
Actually, I'll have white.
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.
- All right.
- Um, well,Julia Bartlett is not an easygoing client.
- She's the worst.
- IfCarrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.
Oh, honey.
- Doesn't mean you're getting a promotion before me.
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what doyou do?
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital... with a specialty in, uh-- heart transplants.
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.
And how long have you two been together?
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thirtyyears.
- I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- No.
- Gray's my sister.
Oh, my God!
No!
Ick!
No, I'm--
I just-
- I thought thatyou two were an item.
Well, I just--
- What?
These-These two?
- Well, yeah.
You seem so--
So?
I don't know.
So together, I guess.
Hey, what'd I miss?
- Um, she thinks we're together.
- Like "together"together?
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!
You're not the first one to think that, Elaine.
- Let me tell you.
- What?
- They're very codependent.
- We are not!
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart.
But ifthat's--
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.
How about that-
- Remember?
You want to know something?
I've even seen them share the same toothbrush.
- One time.
- Oh, ick.
- One time is-- it's creepy.
- I-
- Listen.
I think thatyour relationship is charming.
- Thankyou.
- Haveyou ever French-kissed?
That's beautiful.
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?
You know, the sisters that were 1 03 and 1 05, and they never got married... and theyjust did yoga and headstands together every day.
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.
- I'm serious.
We need to venture out.
- To where?
When?
I'm too busy to date, and I'm not goin' to bars.
The girls there, all they do is they talk about how fat they are.
They're not fat.
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.
You know what I want?
I want a girl who's not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay... and have no guilt attached, that's what I want.
Can'tyou meet a cute intern at the hospital?
Wrong.
Can't do it.
Too dangerous.
You can't have sexual tension and cut an artery.
It's awkward.
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl foryou, and you look for a guy for me...
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers is one ofthe Spice Girls.
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.
Somebodywho doesn't think Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.
Someone who would call me an hour after our first date and say...
"I am crazy aboutyou, and I'm counting the minutes until I could seeyou again."
[With Scots Accent ] That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.
Eatin' with your fingers, things.
It's quite festive.
Hey,Jimmy.
Happy birthday!
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry about that.
Hey,Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
MyWeight Watchers meeting went over, and it was too good to leave.
Why doyou still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.
He has nerve.
He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know.
Right?
But trust me.
The entertainment factor alone is worth it.
Today, it was so crazy.
There was this woman who was all mad at her husband for not letting her have dessert.
So she breaks into the Soho Chocolate Factory... and tried to drown herself in a vat of chocolate.
- No.
- Yes.
- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy.
Wonka?
- Exactly.
It's like the cuckoo show.
Ooh, let's see who's in Page Six today.
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes... with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds like a crossing guard wrote it.
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.
- It's so cool and kitsch.
Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana?
Don't listen to Lana.
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?
I do think she does a lot more than just type for him.
- Give it up.
- Okay.
You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.
- Yeah.
- Lana--Wait, I feel like somebody's listening--
Lana goes to Kemiko, my pedicurist... and told her, who then told Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!
I know it's accurate gossip 'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me to do some research for him, so--
Oh, really.?
Oh, that's too bad.
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Research my ass.
You mean her ass.
B-Pro.
- The campaign--
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.
- It's on, sir.
Carry on, Gray.
The campaign exudes nostalgia, comedy... thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion all under one banner.
It'll appeal to a wide demographic and leads the consumer... with an emotional endbenefit offeeling charged up.
To challenge themselves and seize the day and be the best they can be.
Whoo!
- Well,Julia?
And I must sayyou look fantastic.
What doyou think?
Great, no?
No.
- N-N-No?
- No.
Well, it's, uh--it's just an initialproposal.
I mean, it still needs to be tweaked and tuned.
You only tweak or tune if something has potential.
Uh, we'll, uh--we'll go back to the drawing board then, that's all.
Why don'tyou call mewhen you have something original to present?
Julia, I'm surewe have a bunch of-- Shut that thing off.
I'm sure we have a bunch ofthings.
This isjust one ofthem.
What's wrong with you?
That was crap.
J-Julia, just a second.
I don't know, Sydney.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
How come every road I take turns out to be a dead end?
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.
At least with a fork there's a choice-- right or left or east orwest...
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you thinkyou always reach these dead ends?
Ooh!
You see, gutter ball.
That's my life-- a bunch of gutter balls.
Well, this is a perfect example... ofwhy having therapy in different locations is so important.
Look at the deep symbolism in that gutter ball.
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.
Can you think of one word that best describes...
- the wayyourwork situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?
- No, one.
- Um--
Ohh!
Frustrated.
- You're up.
- Right.
Okay, anotherword... for how you really feel when your brotherwins all your races.
- Frustrated.
- Okay.
Anotherword for how you feel when you think about going on a date.
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.
I know.
But I can't help it.
It's a weird thing, but I see myself as this charming hotel... that's beautifully romantic and... wonderful on the outside... but on the inside, it just needs a ton of renovations.
Hence, closed for repairs.
Nice analogy.
What kinds of renovations?
Getting a promotion at work, perfecting the tango... disowning my mother, getting liposuction under my chin.
There's nothing worse than chin fat.
Uh, I thinkyou need to...
let the idea ofsharing your life with someone other than your brother... enteryour consciousness.
But how can I be conscious of something that I'm unconscious of?
It's not like I don't date.
I've had plenty ofboyfriends.
Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.
Let's try something.
How about keeping the hotel closed... but keeping the veranda open for cocktails?
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front--
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out oftime today... but we will resume this conversation next week at the rock climbing wall.
Nice game.
And what happened to going to a movie?
How areyou going to meet anyone in a dark movie theater?
How areyou going to meet anyone at a dog park?
Hello?
The dog park is a vortex for singles.
Hello?
When did we become dog owners?
- No.
I wash my hand ofthis whole fiasco.
You're on your own.
Ow!
Grabbing.
- Check out center field.
- What about cen--Ahh!
Ohh!
Yes!
Holy... smokes.
I'll do the preinterview.
Ifshe's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"
- and you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball."
- What?
- There's no way.she's single.
- Do what I say.
- You know what?
Don't get bossy.
- Ow!
Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt.
Spazzy men are not attractive.
Some spazzy men are attractive.
- Gosh.
You're so beautiful.
- Thankyou.
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.
- Or should I say 21?
- She's legal.
Yeah.
I suppose I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?
May.be a livermartini with a beefjerky.twist?
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.
Originally.
Charlotte, but it alway.s seemed too long and never quite suited me, so --
I 'm Gray.
You can't really shorten that or it'd be "Gra."
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meety.ou.
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.
- Dancing?
Are you athletic?
- Uh--
- Doyou watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well--
Doy.ou have a boyfrriend?
What isy.ourfavorite dessert?
Okay.
Um, uh--
Let's see.
I'm a 1 940s movie buff.
I love to swing dance.
I've never been very good at sports... um, love the Discovery Channel, "nix-ay" on the boyfriend... and, well, it's kind ofa toss-up.
I-I like cheesecake, but I kind of love... those big, gooey hot fudge sundaes, so--
Get the ball.
Who's that?
Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute.
What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- Suki.
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.
Oh, well, you are so adorable.
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.
He's one-
- He's one-five.
He's 15.
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.
Sam.
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people... that illegally keeps endangered animals in their apartment, like that guy... that got caught with a leopard in his kitchen?
No.
I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at NewYorkAquarium.
- Ha!
That's a relief.
- Free Willy. is my favorite movie.
Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.
And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.
Orca.
Orca not so much.

- Uh, sort of, yeah.
I'm staying on a friend's sofa for right now.
I just moved here from San Francisco about three weeks ago.

- Really?
Have you spent much time there?
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.
I know I've never been to San Francisco, but I know I would love it.
Tony.Bennett loves it.
He left his heart there.
I love Tony.
Bennett.
There y.ou go.
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?
Yeah.
You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons, 'cause we love that dog.
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny.
Gypsy's not mine either.
I dog walk on the side for extra cash.
I should probably get her back, so--
Oh.
It was really nice to meetyou both.
- Nice meeting you both--You.
- Nice meeting you.
- What areyou waiting for?
- What?
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.
All right.
Uh, excuse me!
Sincey.ou're newin town, ify.ou're not doing anything tonight, may.bey.ou'djoin us?
We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine, ify.ou'd like tojoin us.

The spaghetti pooch smooch.
Nothing better.
Thank God we're home.
My toes are even starting to swell.
I'm exhausted.
Dogs are barking?
No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.
I'm wide awake.
I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.
- Oh, yeah?
Me too.
You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.
Let's go to Soho House orSway.
orlike a diner orsomething.
- Ow.
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?
Big meeting in the morning you have to get to?
Oh, that big meeting.
Actually, I'm pretty tired.
I should go to bed.
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay.
Good night.
I hope we can do this again.
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.
Night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got in late last night.
I didn't even hearyou come in.
- I'm just getting in now.
- Sounds likeyou had a good time.
- It was more than good.
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.
Don't blow it.
You're offto a strong start, but a girl can sense a "glommer."
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes.
Glommer.
- I know.
I-
- Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy--
- I know she doesn't--
- She could thinkyou're a glommer and you don't know.
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.
What?
And she said yes.
Can you believe it?
We got ourblood work done this morning, and we're going to Vegas this weekend...
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?
I know.
I t's amazing.
It's like-
- It's-It's-It's-
- It's incredible.
You know what she is?
She's-
- She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.
She's the jackpot.
She's it.
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.
You know what she isn't?
An ax murderer.
You know what she is?
Perfect.
She's perfect.
Gray., rememberwhat Mom alway.s used to say.?
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me.
It's right.
Mom is divorced for the third time, and she lives in a commune.
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."
I'm notjealous ofy.ou wheny.ou're totally.
psy.chologically. unstable.
I'm psychologically unstable?
I'm psyc-- You're the one that said "Get the ball."
I said "Get the ball," not "Get the ring."
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend, and we are gonna get married.
You can come with us.
I bookedy.ou a room.
I bookedy.ou a flight.
Ifyou come, great.
And ifyou don't, that's your deal.
- But you know what?
I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?
One minute you know someone, the next minute they're so desperate...
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.
She doesn't have a lot offriends in the city, and I thought it'd be fun foryou two.
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.
Yeah, I thinkyou're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.
Ifyou want sexy, I got sexy.
I mean, I knowyou kids aren't Little Bo Peep underneath those dresses.
- But... ify.ou ask me... a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.
A beautiful bride, yes.
A glowing bride, ofcourse.
But sexy.is-
- I--
I just don't know.
Personally, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
Really?
Do you have anything in red with a slit up to the hip?
- Red!
- She's kidding.
Just something with a little less piffand poof and no lace.
Oh, no lace?
No problem.
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin... that is to die for.
Great.
Areyou sureyou want to go through with this?
Did you know that Sam cheats at Monopoly and he snores?
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I workwith animals.
Hairy is a turn-on.
Honestly?
I was a goner the moment I saw him at the dog park.
There'sjustsomething about his impish smile and that twinkle in his ey.e.
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out ofthis thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.
Set them free.
Please tell meyou don't wear stufflike that every day.
What?
Lingerie?
I love it.
I've spent more on lingerie than I have on rent.
I haven't bought a new pair of underwear in over fouryears.
- Eww.
That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don'tyou try a dress on?
- No.
- Come on.
This one's only 1 0,000.
No way, no way.
Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.
Come on.
It will be fun.
Try it on.
Forget about it.
No way.
Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.
No!
What ifl damage it?
Shh.
Stay still while I get this zipper up.
Ohh!
Did you cover me?
I was at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?
Yep.
But I told him you were at the gynecologist getting a pap smear.
It shut him up.
- Good one.
- Sowhatwereyou doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.
- No!
- Sorry.
I've been reading too many trashy magazines.
What?
He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
- No.
- Yes!
The wedding is this weekend.
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.
The worst thing is, I can't think ofa reason why he shouldn't marry her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
She's amazing.
Oh, please!
She's a gold-digging wench trying to hook her little claws into a resident surgeon... before he makes the bigbucks thatshe can laterget herhands on... in an ugly, ugly, ugly.
divorce settlement... that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping on the side, will handle.
You're not still taping All My.Children every day?
I TiVo it.
But seriously, you must be flipping out that Sam is getting married...
Ieavingy.ou allalone, completely.single... with no realprospects in the future?
That's horrible.
I feel so bad fory.ou.
Promise me if I ever call you when I 'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.
Sure.
Here you go.
Can I get some change?
Kidding.
Don't spend it all on the slots.
Red 21.
This place is--This is awesome.
Check this out.
This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?
It's a satin-cotton blend.
Possibly Egyptian cotton ifthis is the high-roller room.
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.
'Causeyou're not doin' any high rollin' in this bed till tomorrow.
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.
You're not supposed to see the bride until tomorrow morning.
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall thatyou booked for me.
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.
Besides, we haven't been apart in six whole days.
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.
What are you guys-- What are you guys gonna do without me?
- None ofyour business.
Seeyou at the chapel.
- Ow!
Violent.
You're gonna get socked.
Ow!
Ow!
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.
- Ninja claw!
Ohh!
- Hey!
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane.
We have to take a bath.
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.
- Exactly.
- Right.
I'll order two bottles.
Ta-da!
I hope you didn't greet the room service guy like that.
Hmm.
Is that why he said he didn't need a tip?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Please tell meyou work out three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hateyou.
Ifl told you I had acne until I was 21, would that makeyou feel better?
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.
My nickname was "Connect the Dots."
I have a toast.
To my soon-to-be sister-in-law and my newfound friend--
That's a bathing suityou're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, areyou?
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good since I was 1 7.
I'm not taking offa thing.
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know ifl should.
- You should.
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.
Though I did get kicked out ofthe Brownies for stealing money out of my cookie account.
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.
Relations as in intercourse.
I decided to wait, and I don't know ifthat was a mistake.
I mean, what ifhe's too big or ifI'm too small or--
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you to test drive a car beforeyou buy it?
Thankyou.
Thankyou so much.
Thankyou very much.
Well...
I love Vegas, and I am certain that Vegas loves me... because I lost a bundle on the slots last night.
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know.
I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.
Formy.next number, I'dlike to give a warm welcome to my.surprise guest-- the delightful and charming Miss Charlie Kelsey.
Yeah!
- You didn't.
- Did.
- You didn't!
- Did.
- Why?
- Ooh!
Come on, honey.
How areyou feeling this evening, Charlie?
Like I could throw up at any minute.
Well, that doesn't sound too pleasant.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean because ofyou.
I-
- Can I just sit down, please?
Not too fast.
Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble... to heary.ousing a number with me tonight.
Twelve There, I sang a number.
I'm going home.
- Come on, girlfriend.
I think we can do this.
We can do this.
We can do this.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Whoo!
I can't believe I lost that much money.
Don't tell Sam.
- He liked you too.
- Why did that--
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.
Ah.
My wedding shoes.
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.
- Can't.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
I'll helpyou.
- Mmm!
Sleeping.
Oh.
Here.
Here's a shirt.
Doyou think the woman was mad... when I asked to see her husband's tattoo on his tush?
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.
I still don't know ifit was a ship or a-- a bunny.
Did I tell you how happy I am you're gonna be my sister-in-law?
- About 1 7 times.
- Well, I mean it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that just happened.
How can this be happening?
You're marrying my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.
Oh, this can't be happening.
This is just a mistake.
A meaningless, too-much-tequila mistake.
Oh, my God!
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.
You're already dressed?
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?
Don'tyou thinkwe should talk?
Okay.
Can we talkwhile I get ready?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I guess.
- Great.
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.
- Areyou really upset?
- Yeah.
I would be too ifit were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.
I know it was one ofthose crazy, spontaneous moments... but don'tyou feel weird at all?
Not really.
I mean, I know it may seem strange...
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural.
I feel subnatural.
- In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.
But ifl phone home, Sam would answer, and thatwouldn't be good.
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?
Gray, come on.
Sit down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Anyone would tell you the exact same thing.
It is 1 00% normal to be feeling upset, sad, freaked out.
In fact, considering everything...
I thinkyou're handling the whole thing reallywell.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Your brother is getting married... and deep down insideyou feel likeyou're losing him.
That's whyyou think I'm freaking out?
You think I'm having separation anxiety?
There's only one thing that can keep a marriage together... andthat is love.
Oh.
As the lucky.messenger ofourLordand Saviorabove...
I look to the two ofyou with your bright smiles of devotion... and promise of commitment here in the very house ofthe Lord above!
- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask... ifthere's anybody here who has any objection whatsoever... to the union of these two lovebirds.
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Go ahead.
As I was say.ing... ifthere's anybody here who has an objection to the union... ofthese two love angels, speak their piece now.
Oh, my God!
Look out!
Your hiccups gone?
- Actually, yes.
- Good.
Great.
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.
- Right?
- Right.
Then by.the powervestedin me by.the glorious state ofNevada...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.
Hi.
I'd like a hot dog with kraut on one side and relish on the other... with ketchup on the kraut and mustard on the relish, but don't let the two touch.
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency.
Call me.
Now reach to your right.
Station your left leg on the rock in the middle.
All right, Gray, what's really going on?
I canceled a session with someone today becauseyou said it was an emergency.
- It is.
- Well, then?
Take a deep breath--
And tell me what's going on.
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine.
Then do that.
- I think I'm gay.
- What was that?
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?
It's like this.
Foryears, I thought I was content being single... and I wasn't really interested in a relationship.
I thought thatwhen Mr. Right came into my life, hejustwould.
He-
- He wouldn't needsome fancy.invitation. He wouldjust arrive.
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right I'm waiting for.
It's Mrs. Right.
- Oh.
- And I think I found her.
And I kissed her-- and I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
But I knowthat I likedit.
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.
Why.doy.ou thinky.ou feel nauseous?
Do you thinkyou committed some terrible sin just because you kissed a girl?
Why.?
Ify.ou're two consenting adults, what's so terrible about that?
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.
Oh, so you believe you forced her to kiss you?
No.
No, not at all.
She kissed me.
- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.
Y-You don't know what it's like.
One dayyou thinkyou're one thing... and the next dayyou realize you're something else.
I feel like I'm Dorothy in The WizardofOz.
I'm in this new land and I want to get home... but something is telling me maybe this is my home.
Maybe I shouldn't click my heels three times.
Maybe I should just stay here and be nauseous with the Munchkins.
What scares you most about this whole thing?
That I'll lose Sam and he'll never talk to me again.
Well, whywould Sam even care?
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset I kissed his wife.
Whoa!
- Areyou all right?
- Oh, God.
Y-You're looking pale.
Maybeyou should take some deep breaths.
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a wreck.
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque, begging for forgiveness.
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.
I thinkwe need to talk about this on level ground.
You're not thinking straight.
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?
No.
What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.
You were so jealous ofCharlie... thatyou subconsciously tried to sabotage Sam's marriage.
Read my lips.
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...
- and my heart's telling me--
- Actually, our time is up for today.
Now, forget about Sam and get out there and date.
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?
Now, I will seeyou next week at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
Nice climb.
My hotel is open.
I have suites,junior suites, deluxe accommodations available.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
You know, actually, my grandfather once told me it's much nicer to say...
"That outfit looks very becoming on you."
Well, thanks toyou and your pops.
Whoa.
That coffee smells great.
I'm on this no-caffeine kick right now... but I still find myselfhanging around Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.
Actually, it's not all coffee.
It's one-third coffee, one-third cocoa, one-third chai... with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.
Wow.
That's a new one.
- What was that?
- Mmm-
- Nothing.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Wow.
That--That took guts.
Would you?
Sure.
What time?
- Um, Raoul's at 1 0:00.
- All right.
Well, I'll seeyou then.
Great.
Areyou going up?
- Down.
- Okay.
Seeyou tonight.
- Oh!
- Are-Areyou okay?
- Is anything sprained?
Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thankyou.
- Areyou sure?
- Yes.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, you know, I'm a pretty busy guy.
I'm usually booked up every night.
I'd have to-- I'd have to check my schedule.
- Yeah!
Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.
Cool.
Hey, Gray.
Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?
Oh, you did some serious-
- Oh!
Damage.
Holy smokes.
Look atyou.
What's the occasion?
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?
Yeah.
I got a 8:00 dinnerwith one, and I got a 1 0:00 dinnerwith the other.
That's great.
Did you get that rash you always get beforeyou go out?
- No.
Why did you remind me?
-Just trying to help.
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?
I wanted to check in, see when you thought you might getyour own place.
I know we get alonggreat, and Charlie lovesy.ou... but we are newlyweds so I thought you might--
Do you know how hard it is to find a rent-controlled place in the city?
Why do I have to be the one to move?
One, the lease is in my name, and, two, I found the apartment.
'Cause a 90-year-old woman died on your shift at the hospital.
Her bodywasn't even cold beforeyou were calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.
I didn't hearyou complaining.
As a matter offact, you went to her funeral.
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean likeyou.
You can't kick me out.
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.
I'm just saying maybe you should start looking, that's all.
- I hateyou!
I really do.
- Hey, hey!
Hey!
I can hearyou guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?
- I wasn'tyelling.
She was yelling.
- I was.
I hate him!
- Why?
What did he do now?
- Me?
- That's a little presumptuous, don'tyou think?
- He's kicking me out.
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.
We'll get our own place once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.
- Until then, it's fine.
I actually.kindoflike it.
- You do?
Yeah.
It's fun.
I love living with the both ofyou.
- What's wrong?
- Shit.
She has a couple of dates tonight...
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.
Hey.
I think-- I don't know ifyou remember me...
- but I thinkyou drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida... and when you refer to Ginger's companion... you're not talking about sushi orwasabi.
Not bad.
- Where's that funny accent ofyours from?
- Oh... a funny place called Scotland.
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.
- Hmm.
How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.
I've had two auditions so far.
The first one was for the lead in a tampon spot-- the role ofthe tampon, of course-- and then, uh, the second one was a voice-over... for a pest-control infomercial.
And I didn't get that part.
They, uh--They said that they thought roaches didn't have accents.
I begged to differ, but I didn't want to seem argumentative.
Hmm.
Don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say?
I am a mess.
You don't look like a mess.
You look as cute as a button.
And buttons aren't messy.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
You know, back home in Scotland, I was captain ofthe local football team.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
And all my mates used to come to me with their problems.
They said I was pretty good.
So--
I'm all ears ifyou want to talk to someone from the outside, you know?
Hmm.
That's sweet, but it would take all night to tackle my laundry list.
Thanks.
- Keep the change.
- Thankyou.
I'm crazy aboutyou.
And I'm counting the minutes until I seeyou again.
- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.
We get paid to steal other people's lines.
Seeya.
Uh, seriously, though--
Could I giveyou a lift home tonight?
I couldcome andfetchy.ou about, say., just before midnight.
No charge.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.
With three olives and a tiny splash ofvermouth.
- Okay.
- And just a hint-- a hint-- of salt on the rim.
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Tonight we have a braised lamb shank... marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.
That's served with a creamedpumpkin squash.
We also have a grilled halibut steak... in a soy.-tamari lemon-zest glaze.
And that comes with grilled seaweed and an orange and almond salad.
Do we know what we'd like?
Yes.
I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin squash and the rosemary-lime sauce... and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.
Excellent.
Coming right up.
Conrad, I'm impressed.
You duked the guy.
I didn't knowyou had it in you.
There's a lot in me thaty.ou don't know about.
I'm a burnin'sex machine just waitin'to be usedand abused by.y.ou.
The harder, the better.
Check, please.
...as much as I can, but it's not good.
- How?
- I don't know.
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.
Soy.ou love Capra... you run in the park, you tango... you live for Italy., andy.ou hate asparagus.
Are you sure we weren't separated at birth?
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies... everyThursday since I was 1 5.
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.
Closed hand, deuces wild.
I love it when you talk dirty.
This is actually fun.
I have to admit.
I usually.dread the whole first-date thing.
You know, the awkward lulls in the conversation.
Then the anxious pain in the pit ofmy.stomach when I can't wait... for the night to end, but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.
Yeah, I'm feeling rather painless and "lull-less" myself.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
But, uh, I do want to be honest with you about something.
Oh, no.
Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.
See, I was so flattered with the way you asked me out in the elevator.
- I know.
Don't tell me.
You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married... but Stewart and I have been living together foryears.
- Yeah.
- Stewart--
- Am I a moron orwhat?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- I can't help it.
I'm hopeless.
- You're not.
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.
All you need is some space... some fresh air and some perspective.
Fresh air, space and perspective in New York City.
Stickwith me.
This is unbelievable.
Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah, it's one of the perks of the job.
I give J immy the doorman free rides... and he lets me come up here whenever I fancy.
I love this city.
Oh, me too.
You know, it's funny., 'cause sometimes, up here... everything is so tall and grand.
Even my biggest problems, you know... suddenly seem very wee.
Within seconds theyjust melt away like tiny dewdrops.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.
Ah, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist.
I've been wanting to do that... from the moment I sawyour face in my rearview mirror.
What's wrong?
Oh, Christ.
Was it awful?
I-I'm a wee bit out of practice.
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.
Well, thank you.
Your lips seem... nice and supple too.
But I'm sensing that, uh-- your heart's not doing the Riverdance thing that mine is.
Gordy, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- Forwhat?
For being me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.
I happen to think you're pretty dandy.
Soyou're gay.
Big deal.
- How did you know?
-Just a feeling, I suppose.
That and the fact thatyou haven't shut up about Charlie all night.
And every timeyou mentioned her nameyou got that little... sparkle thing in your eyes.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.
That's easy.
You're gonna move on with your life... start being the person thatyou're supposed to be... instead ofwasting your time pretending to be someone thatyou're not.
I mean, crikey.
Areyou not exhausted?
I am, but it's so much easier to keep pretending.
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!
Isn't it?
As your newfound friend...
I am prescribing a remedy foryou.
That's part ofthe remedy.
This is the remedy.
"I am woman.
Hear me roar."
Helen Reddy.
She'll sortyou out.
There are a few things I'dlike to know abouty.ou too.
All right.
What wouldy.ou like to know?
Oh,just about anything.
Things y.ou like.
Things y.ou don't like.
Where y.ou went to school.
Who was y.our first beau.
What y.ou want out oflife.
- Mmm.
That's a tall order.
Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.
- Till the Clouds Roll By..
- I guess I like what everyone likes.
That's one of my favorite al l-ti me movies.
I know every line and every step.
Me too.
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thankyou.
No.
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.
Will you dance with me?
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.
- Doyou know this dance?
- Yeah.
What's goin' on?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.
Sorry.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?
She must be ovulating.
I heard that.
Huh?
- Howyou doin'?
- Howyou doin'?
Mmm.
She's the best.
Strong, independent, feisty.
- Who areyou talking about?
- Who else?
Queen Oprah.
Oprah.
Oprah the Great.
Oprah-
- I love her.
Do you understand that I'm obsessed with her?
Like, I think she is so great that she should start her own religion.
I love herso much that ifshe andSteadman... couldn't have children and needed a little bit ofhelp...
I would surrogate a child for them.
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.
Wow.
That's a lot oflove.
Last night I was so inspired afterwatching her show about loving your body that--
- Doyou know what I did today?
- What?
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!
Yeah!
Can you believe it?
I quit.
Fergie, "smergie."
I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.
And if Dereck isn't going to love me for the tiny amount... of cellulite I have on the back of my thighs...
- then fuck him-
- Screw that guy.
- Yeah.
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Hot!
- Thankyou.
I mean, why.does oursociety.push us... to be perpetually.uncomfortable with who we are?
It's so messed up.
You wanna know why.?
Here.
This is why.
" Boost your buttocks in five days."
" Luscious liposuction." "The flawless face-lift."
That's why.
Enough is enough.
We need to stop letting society.and-and media... and ourreligious leaders delegate who we are.
You're amazing, and I 'm even more amazing... and anybody who doesn't get it can go screw themselves!
That felt fantastic.
Spewing is a wonderful thing.
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.
That's what they should have.
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.
What arey.ou doinghere?
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.
This better be good.
I'm about to get prepped for surgery.
What is it?
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.
Maybeyou should just get prepped for surgery--
Maybeyou should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.
Gray.
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.
It's really major, and I don't know how to say it.
- Why don'tyou take three short breaths and one--
- One long.
- I'm gay.
- What?
- As in Marvin.
- What?
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray," and-
- Bingo!
Oh.
- That's great.
- What about it is great?
- It's great thatyou're coming out.
- Don't tell meyou knew.
Gray., ofcourse I knew.
How can you know when I didn't even know?
I'm smarter than you.
I've known since second grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?
Tell you, I'm proud ofyou, Gray.
- This is a big moment.
This is huge.
- It's big, all right... but there's one other thing I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.
Bigger.
Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.
- Well, I guess it depends on howyou see it.
- What is it?
- I'm in lovewith her.
- Who?
- Her.
- Who her?
- Yourwife.
- Whose wife?
Yours.
I'm in love with Charlie.
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would neverjoke about it.
I love the way she talked and walked and looked and felt... but it really kicked in afterwe kissed.
Kissed?
What doyou mean, kissed?
Areyou saying you kissed mywife?
Only once, and technically she wasn'tyourwife.
It was the night beforeyourwedding.
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.
Just tell me off.
Justyell at me.
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
Gray, I wantyou to pack upyour shit and get it out ofthe apartment... by the time I get home tonight, because we're done.
All right?
We're done.
There has to be a reason.
Whywould she move out without talking to us about it... or even telling us where she was going?
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?
It's not supposed to mean anything.
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.
Aren'tyou happywe'll have the place to ourselves?
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?
Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- What aren'tyou telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird.
You loveyour sister.
Yes, I love my sister.
How aboutyou?
Doyou love my sister?
Of course I loveyour sister.
I think she's great.
"Great." How great?
- What areyou getting at?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You know what?
I'm late.
I gotta go, okay?
I'll seeyou later.
Sam?
So as you can see, the consumers love to think of nothing but C-Pro.
- B-Pro.
- What?
- B-Pro.
You said "C-Pro."
- I did?
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass ofwater.
Takeyour time.
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.
Gray, hang in there.
You're doing just fine.
- No, I'm not doing fine.
I'm the Titanic.
- No!
- Yes.
- You just gotta--You gotta get focused.
You gotta centeryourself, and you gotta march back in there... and you show them who's the boss.
Who's the Boss?
I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light had reallyweird hair, but--
Gray!
You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?
You gotta get out ofyour head and get intoyour body.
Get out ofyour head and into your body.
Get out ofyour head and into your body.
Get out ofyour head.
Get out ofyour head.
Get out ofyour head and into your body.
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Center yourself.
- And go.
- Go.
Go.
Gimme a "P."Gimme an "R."
Gimme an "O."
What's that spell?
B-Pro!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Lana, what the hell are you doing?
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative executive on the Bartlett account... because I thought it would be best to showJulia two perspectives.
- You mean the one ofher tits and the one ofher ass?
- Gray!
I'm sure that Lana has 36 double-D ideas... forthe account, and I'lljust givey.ou yourprivacy.to fondle through them.
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.
I'm sure it cost me my job.
Well, with copy like that, they should be begging you to stay.
Here.
Drink that while it's still hot.
That, young lady, is my granny's secret recipe.
Mmm!
This is so good.
What's in this?
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey and a wee bit of nutmeg.
Gordy.,y.ou are amazing.
You barely.know me andy.ou're such a great friend.
You're gonna make some lucky girl very happy one day.
So are you.
God, everything is so complicated.
If it was 30 years ago, I could just move away and join a convent.
Those outfits are so hideous.
You know, ifyou want my advice-- and I don't supposeyou do, but I'm going to give it toyou anyway.
- I thinkyou have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?
You have to tell her the truth.
- I can't do that.
- Yes,y.ou can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I mean, for all you know, she might feel the same way about you.
Come on.
Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.
Buty.ou won't know that untily.ou talk to her.
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?
What ifyou go through your entire life saying, "What if?"
What happens if she does feel the same way?
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.
- He doesn't talk toyou now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.
And doyou foresee that ever changing?
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm.Just drinkyour tea.
This is so good.
Areyou sure this is just tea, nutmeg and honey?
Wee bit ofwhiskey.
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!
What kind ofshortbread is this?
Mmm, short.
God, they.'re so beautiful andmagicalandpeaceful.
Will they.have babies here?
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality among mammals.
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales... but did you know that over 50% of elephants are gay?
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People... over loudspeakers and watch their feet.
I'm kidding.
So where'veyou been hiding?
I've left three messages and no answer, and Sam won't say a word.
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.
Anything you want to talk about?
Doyou remember that night we spent together in Las Vegas beforeyou got married to Sam?
Barely.
I mean, I remember having a great time... but I thinkyou got me too drunk to remember anything else.
Why?
Did I say something really stupid?
- It's not whatyou said.
- God.
What did I do?
I don't know ifyou did anything.
It might havejust been me.
- Oh, my God.
I remember.
- You do?
- Yes.
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.
How could you let your brother marry me?
I didn't know ifyou were conscious ofwhat was going on.
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?
I sounded like a cat in heat, didn't I?
Is that whatyou think we're talking about?
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?
- No.
That was it.
- Areyou sure?
- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.
Did you try to convince Sam not to marry me?
There was no convincing him.
Trust me.
Ifl could have, I would have.
You know, every morning I wake up before Sam does... and I just watch him.
I just lie there and stare.
And I love the way his nose wrinkles when he's dreaming... and the little purring sound that he makes when he's about to wake up.
Andthe way.that he keeps his hand on my.thigh the whole night... just to let me know that he's there.
And I know it may.seem crazy.... but love is crazy, isn't it?
It sure is.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?
You're so lucky..
I neverhada brother orsister.
Oh!
I don't know what's going on between the two ofy.ou... but you have to work it out, Sam.
J ust talk to her.
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah.
Gray.
Seems J ulia wasn't thrilled with the way our last presentation went.
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated or patronized anymore.
- Actually, I was gonna giveyou a promotion, but--
- What?
I asked Jordan to makeyou the executive creative director on my account... and to giveyou free rein to do whateveryou want.
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea was yours.
I thinky.ou have great ideas.
You just haven't been given the freedom to explore them fully.
I like your energy, your spunk, your candidness... and I think with the right support... you're gonna give me exactlywhat I'm looking for.
Wow!
- I don't know what to say.
- Sorryto interrupt, Gray.... buty.our 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics is in the small conference room.
Oh, I don't have a 1 2:00 meeti ng with Brother Electronics.
They.said they. confirmed it with y.our office.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.
Thankyou so much.
You will not be sorry.
Thankyou, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.
Isn't she adorable?
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't haveyou in my book.
Hey.
See,y.ou forgoty.ourtoothbrush... and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard, part soft bristles... must be hard to come by.
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?
And to say I'm sorry.
I overreacted-- Little bit.
Not a lot.
Little bit.
After all, you have to admit... it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...
I'm not quite sure why I got so surprised... 'cause ifyou think about it... it's almost inevitable thatyou and I would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?
You're acting-- You're acting very rational.
It's too rational.
You used to do this when we were kids.
Then I'd turn around and you'd tackle me.
I should be getting my knees in the lock-down position.
You know, Gray--
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.
You know that, right?
Being without you I feel like one half of me is missing.
Lately I've been feeling very lopsided.
- Oh, Sam.
-Just 'causeyou're totally gay... and in love with mywife doesn't mean we can't work things out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.
Now, this is good.
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!
- Oh, my--
- Gray!
Gray!
Gray!
How ya doin'?
How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.
Putyour eyes back in your heads.
Hey, what-
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.
- I neverwanna see another human being ever again.
- No.
Look.
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad--
Who cares what those people think?
I care.
They're probably calling Jerry Springer right now as we speak.
No.
No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry forwhat?
For having to be related to me.
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel
Gray, look.
You're just-- You're just coming out, okay?
- I am never coming out ofthis elevator.
- This is probably... the biggest revelation ofyour entire life.
It's normal to be going nuts.
- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.
I don't feel any ofthose things.
Well, how doyou feel?
- Lonely.
- Why?
Because I'm never gonna be able to walk down the street... holding hands with my partner... without the rest ofthe world giving us a look.
I may never have the wedding that I once dreamed of... and I may never have children... and one day, when I die... people will never give as much respect to my grieving lover... as if she were my husband.
Gray...
It's not as if you made a choice.
That's what terrifies me.
It's so much easier to be someone else.
Doyou remember when we were kids-- you wouldhave been aboutsix-- and Dad came home to tell Mom he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.
Yeah.
Rememberwe stay.ed in the closet all night... just cuddled up like two little mice and...
Iistened to theirwhole fight.
I was... so angry.
I was... hurt.
I was just--
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there and kick his ass...
- and you rememberwhatyou said to me?
- Hmm.
You were just six... butyou said it was gonna be okay... that Dad was not gonna live a lie... that he was gonna try and be happy... and that everyone deserved to be happy.
I said that?
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.
Why are you being so nice to me?
- You should hate me.
- Forwhat?
For having good taste?
You never have to worry about it.
I mean, she's completely, madly, passionately...
like cow-jump-over-the-moon in love with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great... for me.
Not so great foryou.
But you're not gonna make me feel guilty for this areyou?
Mm-mmm.
Gray, you know what?
You can't expect the first girl thatyou fall in love with... to loveyou back.
That's--That's not how it works.
That would be the equivalent of settling down when you were age 1 2.
You haven't gone through gay pubertyyet.
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?
- No.
Ofthe elevator.
- Ofthe elevator.
I should have broken up with Dereck ages ago.
I am having the best time.
- So what aboutyou?
Haveyou met anyoneyet?
- Notyet.
Really?
Girls should be lining up around the block foryou.
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?
It depends, I guess.
- Funny.
You need funny.
- Funnywould be good.
- And stylish.
No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.
And for the love ofGod, don't wind up... with one ofthose ladies who doesn't believe in waxing.
- You're killing me.
- Can I askyou a question?
- Yeah.
- Haveyou ever been attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
- Not even a little?
- No.
- Huh.
Oh.
Not even last year, when I was in shape after taking those Pilates classes?
Or last weekwhen I wore that pink MarcJacobs dress to work... and you told me how cute I looked?
You looked so cute.
You are cute, but, you know, not cute that way, cute.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's so depressing.
It's not like I'm into girls, but ifl was a girl who was into girls...
I'd definitely be into me, 'cause I think I'm a catch.
You are a catch, but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.
Hmm.
Butyou said you don't have a type.
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.
Wait.
Don'tyou usually have therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?
Oh, my God.
I'm so late.
Shoot.
Okay.
You know, I don't reallywant to go, so watch this.
Sydney, it's Gray.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't wanna go to the batting cages... and I don't wanna go rock climbing or bowling or anywhere with you... 'cause I'm feeling really good about myself... and I don't thinkyou're a very good therapist for me, soyou're fired.
Thank you, and have a nice day.
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?
That was amazing.
Do you want to get a mani-pedi before we go back to work?
- Sure.
I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.
What ifl dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?
- Yes.
- Really?
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!
I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?
Because you're gay, and you have to start behaving' like it.
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?
No, butyou haven't had sex with a woman yet... and, you know, that's like being black... and never having listened to theJackson Five... or being Jewish and never having a knish... or being Indian and never having had a curry or being--
Or being Scottish and not keeping your mouth shut?
- I suppose so.
Come on.
- Hi.
Sorry.
No men allowed.
Wh-
- Isn't that against the law?
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.
- No exceptions.
No men.
- Forget it.
Well,just go in byyourself.
I can't go in by myself.
Areyou kidding?
I have an idea.
I would like an Apricot Sour, please.
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.
And a touch oflemon and a squeeze oflime.
And a little bit ofsugar on the rim.
Comin' up.
Apricot Sour?
I thought thatwas whatyou women drank, for Christ's sakes.
- One ofyour eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.
Hi.
Can I buyyou a drink?
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.
See, but thanks.
You don't?
Shut up.
This is quite tasty, actually.
Let's get out ofhere.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.
Hey, give it a minute.
Oh, my.God. It'sJulia Bartlett.
- Quick, quick.
I gotta get out ofhere.
- Why?
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello.
Is there anybody in?
No.
Her?
You think?
Gray, did your mom ever tell you... whatyour I.Q. scores were?
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.
- It's nice to seeyou.
- Nice to seeyou too.
I'm just taking a break from working on your account.
Gray, I didn't come over here to check up on you.
Um, hello.
Uh, my name's Georgette.
- Hi.
- Nice to meetyou.
And, uh, lovely.
And I'm just gonna leaveyou two to, uh-- to, uh-- to catch up on everything.
- Mmm.
Lovely.
- Don't go.
Yeah, it was lovely to seeyou too.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Dutch way--Three kisses.
So, uh--
Fine.
It's fine.
I'm fine.
You're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, and I've got to go now.
Bye.
You really surprised me the other day.
I had no idea you were gay.
That makes two of us.
You're not just coming out, areyou?
Put it this way.
My hotel's been closed for a long time... but tonight's the grand opening.
There have been a few fake openings... but tonight's the real deal.
I-
- No, I don't understand.
Yes, I'm just coming out.
I don't think anyone in herewill mind.
You really are adorable.
I always thought so.
Really?
From day one, in that little cream, pin-striped suityou werewearing.
I like that suit too.
I think I got it at, uh, Banana Republic.
Or maybe it was, uh, Emporio Armani.
Actually, it could have been Barneys, but the shirt was from Bloomies.
Listen.
I have this beautiful bottle ofcognac... that Ijust brought back from France, and I would--
- I 'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?
No.
My place.
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.
Uh, okay, well--
I like cognac.
I like cognac.
I like brandy.too.
Usually I have a little cognac with a splash ofbrandy on the side.
I have brandy too.
- Give it up.
You're toast.
- You're gonna eat those words.
Come on, Gray.!
Come on!
GRAY MATTERS Spell checking by Pippi Longstocking March 6, 2011
- What are you doing?
Come back.
- No.
- Come on.
Turn around.
- Hey, hey!
.
You're the best.
You're amazing.
What do you say?
Beers on me.
Cold beers on me.
- Let's go!
.
Wonderful.
Weren't they wonderful?
Come on.
Keep it going, Gray.
- Hey.
- Help!
.
- Okay.
- Help.
Ohh.
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?
- Yeah.
Mmm.
- What do you got?
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.
- And chicken.
- Good.
- And fish.
- And fish.
- And tofu.
- Good.
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great.
We got tempeh.
Then I got the regular essentials, like asparagus and lettuce.
- I got it.
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay?
Let's-
Hello?
Hey, Carrie.
Who?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, honey.
- Dinner?
No.
We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.
- We go out.
I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.
Do you want something fruity or full-bodied and do-
Okay.
Okay.
What
- Californian, French, Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span-
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have to yell.
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.
That is amazing.
Oh, my God.
Carrie.
Do you believe this?
Ta-da!
I would like to say something.
To Carrie and Dereck and their lovely friends.
[ Speaking Italian ]
Oh, my goodness.
I don't know what it means, but it sounded beautiful.
- It's a fake accent.
He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?
- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.
And poofs are rarely beefy.
I wrote a piece about that in a magazine once.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Carrie, do you have the new Liza Minnelli CD?
- Mmm.
Okay., and scratch my last comment.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.
- Oh, uh, more for you, yeah?
- Yes.
- Red or white?
- I'll have red.
Actually, I'll have white.
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.
- All right.
- Um, well,Julia Bartlett is not an easy going client.
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.
Oh, honey.
- Doesn't mean you're getting a promotion before me.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what do you do?
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital... with a specialty in, uh- [ Imitates Heartbeat] heart transplants.
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.
And how long have you two been together?
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thirty years.
- [ Laughing ]
- I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- No.
- Gray's my sister.
Oh, my God!
No!
Ick!
No, I'm-
I just
- I thought that you two were an item.
Well, I just-
- What?
These-These two?
- Well, yeah.
You seem so-
So?
I don't know.
So together, I guess.
Hey, what'd I miss?
- Um, she thinks we're together.
- Like "together" together?
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!
You're not the first one to think that, Elaine.
- Let me tell you.
- What?
- They're very codependent.
- [ Together] We are not!
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart.
But if that's-
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.
How about that
- Remember?
You want to know something?
I've even seen them share the same toothbrush.
- [ Together] One time.
- Oh, ick.
- One time is- it's creepy.
- I
- Listen.
I think that your relationship is charming.
- Thank you.
- Have you ever French-kissed?
[Laughing] That's beautiful.
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?
You know, the sisters that were 103 and 105, and they never got married... and they just did yoga and headstands together every day.
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.
- I'm serious.
We need to venture out.
- To where?
When?
I'm too busy to date, and I'm not goin' to bars.
The girls there, all they do is they talk about how fat they are.
They're not fat.
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.
You know what I want?
I want a girl who's not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay... and have no guilt attached, that's what I want.
Can't you meet a cute intern at the hospital?
[ Imitates Buzzer] Wrong.
Can't do it.
Too dangerous.
You can't have sexual tension and cut an artery.
It's awkward.
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl for you, and you look for a guy for me...
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers is one of the Spice Girls.
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.
Somebody who doesn't think Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.
Someone who would call me an hour after our first date and say...
"I am crazy about you, and I'm counting the minutes until I could see you again."
[With Scots Accent ] That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.
Eatin' with your fingers, things.
It's quite festive.
[ Laughing ]
Hey,Jimmy.
Happy birthday!
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry about that.
Hey,Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
My Weight Watchers meeting went over, and it was too good to leave.
Why do you still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.
He has nerve.
He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know.
Right?
But trust me.
The entertainment factor alone is worth it.
Today, it was so crazy.
There was this woman who was all mad at her husband for not letting her have dessert.
So she breaks into the Soho Chocolate Factory... and tried to drown herself in a vat of chocolate.
- No.
- Yes.
- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka?
- Exactly.
It's like the cuckoo show.
Ooh, let's see who's in Page Six today.
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes... with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds like a crossing guard wrote it.
What happened to that cheer leading idea?
That was so good.
- It's so cool and kitsch.
Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana?
Don't listen to Lana.
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?
I do think she does a lot more than just type for him.
- Give it up.
- Okay.
You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.
- Yeah.
- Lana-Wait, I feel like somebody's listening-
Lana goes to Kemiko, my pedicurist... and told her, who then told Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!
I know it's accurate gossip 'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me to do some research for him, so-
Oh, really?
Oh, that's too bad.
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Bye.
[ Whispering ] Research my ass.
You mean her ass.

[ Ends ]
- The campaign-
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.
- [ Beeps ]
- It's on, sir.
Carry on, Gray.
The campaign exudes nostalgia, comedy... thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion all under one banner.
It'll appeal to a wide demographic and leads the consumer... with an emotional end benefit of feeling charged up.
To challenge themselves and seize the day and be the best they can be.
Whoo!
- [ Mouthing Words ]
- Well, Julia?
And I must say you look fantastic.
What do you think?
Great, no?
No.
- N-N-No?
- No.
Well, it's, uh-it's just an initial proposal.
I mean, it still needs to be tweaked and tuned.
You only tweak or tune if something has potential.
Uh, we'll, uh-we'll go back to the drawing board then, that's all.
Why don't you call me when you have something original to present?
Julia, I'm sure we have a bunch of- Shut that thing off.
I'm sure we have a bunch of things.
This is just one of them.
What's wrong with you?
That was crap.
J-Julia, just a second.
I don't know, Sydney.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
How come every road I take turns out to be a dead end?
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.
At least with a fork there's a choice- right or left or east or west...
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you think you always reach these dead ends?
Ooh!
You see, gutter ball.
That's my life- a bunch of gutter balls.
Well, this is a perfect example... of why having therapy in different locations is so important.
Look at the deep symbolism in that gutter ball.
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.
Can you think of one word that best describes...
- the way your work situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?
- No, one.
- Um-
Ohh!
Frustrated.
- You're up.
- Right.
Okay, another word... for how you really feel when your brother wins all your races.
- Frustrated.
- Okay.
Another word for how you feel when you think about going on a date.
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.
I know.
But I can't help it.
It's a weird thing, but I see myself as this charming hotel... that's beautifully romantic and... wonderful on the outside... but on the inside, it just needs a ton of renovations.
Hence, closed for repairs.
Nice analogy.
What kinds of renovations?
Getting a promotion at work, perfecting the tango... disowning my mother, getting liposuction under my chin.
There's nothing worse than chin fat.
Uh, I think you need to... let the idea of sharing your life with someone other than your brother... enter your consciousness.
But how can I be conscious of something that I'm unconscious of?
It's not like I don't date.
I've had plenty of boyfriends.
Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.
Let's try something.
How about keeping the hotel closed... but keeping the veranda open for cocktails?
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front-
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out of time today... but we will resume this conversation next week at the rock climbing wall.
Nice game.
And what happened to going to a movie?
How are you going to meet anyone in a dark movie theater?
How are you going to meet anyone at a dog park?
Hello?
The dog park is a vortex for singles.
Hello?
When did we become dog owners?
- [Barking]
- No.
[ Panting ]
I wash my hand of this whole fiasco.
You're on your own.
Ow!
Grabbing.
- Check out center field.
- What about cen-Ahh!
Ohh!
Yes!
Holy... smokes.
I'll do the preinterview.
If she's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"
- and you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball."
- What?
- There's no way she's single.
- Do what I say.
- You know what?
Don't get bossy.
- Ow!
Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt.
Spazzy men are not attractive.
Some spazzy men are attractive.
- Gosh.
You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.
- Or should I say 21?
- She's legal.
Yeah.
I suppose I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?
Maybe a liver martini with a beef jerky twist?
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.
Originally.
Charlotte, but it always seemed too long and never quite suited me, so-
I 'm Gray.
You can't really shorten that or it'd be "Gra."
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.
- Dancing?
Are you athletic?
- Uh-
- Do you watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well-
Do you have a boyfriend?
What is your favorite dessert?
[ Chuckles ] Okay.
Um, uh-
Let's see.
I'm a 1940s movie buff.
I love to swing dance.
I've never been very good at sports... um, love the Discovery Channel, "nix-ay" on the boyfriend... and, well, it's kind of a toss-up.
I-I like cheesecake, but I kind of love... those big, gooey hot fudge sundaes, so-
[ Laughing ] Get the ball.
[ Gray.
Chuckling]
[ Chuckles ]
Who's that?
Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute.
What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- Suki.
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.
Oh, well, you are so adorable.
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.
He's one
- He's one-five.
He's 15.
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.
Sam.
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people... that illegally keeps endangered animals in their apartment, like that guy... that got caught with a leopard in his kitchen?
No.
I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at New York Aquarium.
- Ha!
That's a relief.
- Free Willy is my favorite movie.
Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.
And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.
Orca.
Orca not so much.
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.
I'm staying on a friend's sofa for right now.
I just moved here from San Francisco about three weeks ago.
- I love San Francisco.
- Really?
Have you spent much time there?
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.
I know I've never been to San Francisco, but I know I would love it.
Tony Bennett loves it.
He left his heart there.
I love Tony Bennett.
There you go.
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?
Yeah.
You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons, 'cause we love that dog.
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny.
Gypsy's not mine either.
I dog walk on the side for extra cash.
I should probably get her back, so-
Oh.
It was really nice to meet you both.
- Nice meeting you both-You.
- Nice meeting you.
- What are you waiting for?
- What?
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.
All right.
Uh, excuse me!
Since you're new in town, if you're not doing anything tonight, maybe you'd join us?
We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine, if you'd like to join us.
I just said that.
Would you like to join us?
Three times.
- Yeah, I 'd love to.
- Okay.

- Oh, good one.
Okay, is it me?

Uh, women you need to get away from.
Bette Davis in What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?
Ah, good one.
I got Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction for the rabbit.
- Kathy Bates in Misery..
- Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout, um, best screen kiss?
- Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.
- That's overrated, I think.
I'll go with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Notorious.
Okay.
I'll see your Notorious... and I'll raise you Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.
- Very good.
- Oh, wait.
I'll see your Doctor Zhivago... and I will raise you Lady and the Tramp in Lady and the Tramp.
Winner.
Winner.
The spaghetti pooch smooch.
Nothing better.
Thank God we're home.
My toes are even starting to swell.
I'm exhausted.
Dogs are barking?
No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.
I'm wide awake.
I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.
- Oh, yeah?
Me too.
You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.
Let's go to Soho House or Sway.
or like a diner or something.
- [ Foot Stomps ]
- Ow.
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?
Big meeting in the morning you have to get to?
Oh, that big meeting.
Actually, I'm pretty tired.
I should go to bed.
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay.
Good night.
I hope we can do this again.
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.
Night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got in late last night.
I didn't even hear you come in.
- I'm just getting in now.
- Sounds like you had a good time.
- It was more than good.
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.
Don't blow it.
You're off to a strong start, but a girl can sense a "glommer."
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes.
Glommer.
- I know.
I
- Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy-
- I know she doesn't-
- She could think you're a glommer and you don't know.
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.
What?
And she said yes.
[ Chuckles ] Can you believe it?
We got our blood work done this morning, and we're going to Vegas this weekend...
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?
I know.
It's amazing.
It's like
- It's-It's-It's
- It's incredible.
You know what she is?
She's
- She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.
She's the jackpot.
She's it.
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.
You know what she isn't?
An ax murderer.
You know what she is?
Perfect.
She's perfect.
Gray, remember what Mom always used to say?
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me.
It's right.
Mom is divorced for the third time, and she lives in a commune.
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."
I'm not jealous of you when you're totally.
psychologically unstable.
I'm psychologically unstable?
I'm psyc- You're the one that said "Get the ball."
I said "Get the ball," not "Get the ring."
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend, and we are gonna get married.
You can come with us.
I booked you a room.
I booked you a flight.
If you come, great.
And if you don't, that's your deal.
- But you know what?
I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?
One minute you know someone, the next minute they're so desperate...
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.
She doesn't have a lot of friends in the city, and I thought it'd be fun for you two.
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.
If you want sexy, I got sexy.
I mean, I know you kids aren't Little Bo Peep underneath those dresses.
- [ Slurping ]
- But... if you ask me... a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.
A beautiful bride, yes.
A glowing bride, of course.
But sexy is
- I-
I just don't know.
Personally, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
Really?
Do you have anything in red with a slit up to the hip?
- Red!
- She's kidding.
Just something with a little less piff and poof and no lace.
Oh, no lace?
No problem.
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin... that is to die for.
Great.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Did you know that Sam cheats at Monopoly and he snores?
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I work with animals.
Hairy is a turn-on.
Honestly?
I was a goner the moment I saw him at the dog park.
There's just something about his impish smile and that twinkle in his eye.
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out of this thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.
Set them free.
Please tell me you don't wear stuff like that every day.
What?
Lingerie?
I love it.
I've spent more on lingerie than I have on rent.
I haven't bought a new pair of underwear in over four years.
- [ Slurping ] - [ Chuckles ]
- Eww.
That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don't you try a dress on?
- No.
- Come on.
This one's only $10 000.
No way, no way.
Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.
Come on.
It will be fun.
Try it on.
Forget about it.
No way.
Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.
No!
What if I damage it?
Shh.
Stay still while I get this zipper up.
[ Gasps ]
Ohh!
Did you cover me?
I was at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?
Yep.
But I told him you were at the gynecologist getting a pap smear.
It shut him up.
- Good one.
- So what were you doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.
- No!
- Sorry.
I've been reading too many trashy magazines.
What?
He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
- No.
- Yes!
The wedding is this weekend.
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.
The worst thing is, I can't think of a reason why he shouldn't marry her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
She's amazing.
Oh, please!
She's a gold-digging wench trying to hook her little claws into a resident surgeon... before he makes the big bucks that she can later get her hands on... in an ugly, ugly, ugly.
divorce settlement... that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping on the side, will handle.
You're not still taping All My Children every day?
I tivo it.
But seriously, you must be flipping out that Sam is getting married... leaving you all alone, completely single... with no real prospects in the future?
That's horrible.
I feel so bad for you.
Promise me if I ever call you when I 'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.
Sure.
Here you go.
Can I get some change?
Kidding.
Don't spend it all on the slots.
Red 21.
This place is-This is awesome.
[ Chuckles ]
Check this out.
This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?
It's a satin-cotton blend.
Possibly Egyptian cotton if this is the high-roller room.
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.
'Cause you're not doin' any high rollin' in this bed till tomorrow.
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.
You're not supposed to see the bride until tomorrow morning.
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall that you booked for me.
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.
Besides, we haven't been apart in six whole days.
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.
What are you guys- What are you guys gonna do without me?
- None of your business.
See you at the chapel.
- Ow!
Violent.
You're gonna get socked.
Ow!
Ow!
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.
- Ninja claw!
Ohh!
- Hey!
[ Laughs ]
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane.
We have to take a bath.
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.
- Exactly.
- Right.
I'll order two bottles.
Ta-da!
[ Laughs ] I hope you didn't greet the room service guy like that.
Hmm.
Is that why he said he didn't need a tip?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Please tell me you work out three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hate you.
If I told you I had acne until I was 21, would that make you feel better?
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.
My nickname was "Connect the Dots."
[ Both Laughing ]
I have a toast.
To my soon-to-be sister-in-law and my newfound friend-
That's a bathing suit you're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, are you?
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good since I was 17.
I'm not taking off a thing.
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know if I should.
- You should.
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.
Though I did get kicked out of the Brownies for stealing money out of my cookie account.
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.
Relations as in intercourse.
I decided to wait, and I don't know if that was a mistake.
I mean, what if he's too big or i f I'm too small or-
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you to test drive a car before you buy it?
[ Laughs ]
[Cheering, Applause ]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Well...
I love Vegas, and I am certain that Vegas loves me... because I lost a bundle on the slots last night.
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know.
I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.
For my next number, I'd like to give a warm welcome to my surprise guest- the delightful and charming Miss Charlie Kelsey.
Yeah!
- You didn't.
- Did.
- You didn't!
- Did.
- Why?
- Ooh!
Come on, honey.
How are you feeling this evening, Charlie?
Like I could throw up at any minute.
Well, that doesn't sound too pleasant.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean because of you.
I
- Can I just sit down, please?
Not too fast.
Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble... to hear you sing a number with me tonight.
-Twelve!
- Come on, girlfriend.
I think we can do this.
[Piano:

We can do this.
We can do this.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[ Singing Disco ]
[ Singing Along ]
- Whoo!
[ Continues ]
[ Gray] I can't believe I lost that much money.
Don't tell Sam.
- He liked you too.
- Why did that-
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.
Ah.
My wedding shoes.
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.
- Can't.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
I'll help you.
- Mmm!
Sleeping.
[ Sighs ]
Oh.
Here.
Here's a shirt.
Do you think the woman was mad... when I asked to see her husband's tattoo on his tush?
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.
I still don't know if it was a ship or a- a bunny.
Did I tell you how happy I am you're gonna be my sister-in-law?
- About 17 times.
- Well, I mean it.
[ Moaning ]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
[ Spitting ]
I can't believe that just happened.
How can this be happening?
You're marrying my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.
[ Exhales ] Oh, this can't be happening.
This is just a mistake.
A meaningless, too-much-tequila mistake.
Oh, my God!
[ Buzzing ]
- [ Stops ] - [ Groans ]
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.
You're already dressed?
[ Groans ]
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?
Don't you think we should talk?
Okay.
Can we talk while I get ready?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I guess.
- Great.
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.
- Are you really upset?
- Yeah.
I would be too if it were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.
I know it was one of those crazy, spontaneous moments... but don't you feel weird at all?
Not really.
I mean, I know it may seem strange...
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural.
I feel subnatural.
- [ Gargling ]
- In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.
But if I phone home, Sam would answer, and that wouldn't be good.
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?
Gray, come on.
Sit down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Anyone would tell you the exact same thing.
It is 100% normal to be feeling upset, sad, freaked out.
In fact, considering everything...
I think you're handling the whole thing really well.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Your brother is getting married... and deep down inside you feel like you're losing him.
That's why you think I'm freaking out?
You think I'm having separation anxiety?
[Organ]
[ Singing Gospel ]
There's only one thing that can keep a marriage together... and that is love.
[ Choir Singing]
Oh.
As the lucky messenger of our Lord and Savior above...
I look to the two of you with your bright smiles of devotion... and promise of commitment here in the very house of the Lord above!
[ Resumes ]
- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask... if there's anybody here who has any objection whatsoever... to the union of these two lovebirds.
[ Hiccups ]
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Go ahead.
As I was saying... if there's anybody here who has an objection to the union... of these two love angels, speak their piece now.
[ Hiccups ]
Oh, my God!
Look out!
[ Screams ]
Your hiccups gone?
- Actually, yes.
- Good.
Great.
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.
- Right?
- Right.
Then by the power vested in me by the glorious state of Nevada...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.
[ Gospel]
[ Man Singing Pop ]
Hi.
I'd like a hot dog with kraut on one side and relish on the other... with ketchup on the kraut and mustard on the relish, but don't let the two touch.
[ Continues ]
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency.
Call me.
[ Continues ]
[ Fades ]
Station your left leg on the rock in the middle.
All right, Gray, what's really going on?
I canceled a session with someone today because you said it was an emergency.
- It is.
- Well, then?
Take a deep breath- [ Inhales ]
- [ Exhales ]
- And tell me what's going on.
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine.
Then do that.
- [ Whispering ] I think I'm gay.
- What was that?
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?
It's like this.
For years, I thought I was content being single... and I wasn't really interested in a relationship.
I thought that when Mr. Right came into my life, he just would.
He
- He wouldn't need some fancy invitation.
He would just arrive.
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right I'm waiting for.
It's Mrs. Right.
- Oh.
- And I think I found her.
And I kissed her- [ Sighs ] and I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
But I know that I liked it.
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.
Why do you think you feel nauseous?
Do you think you committed some terrible sin just because you kissed a girl?
Why?
If you're two consenting adults, what's so terrible about that?
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.
Oh, so you believe you forced her to kiss you?
No.
No, not at all.
She kissed me.
- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.
Y-You don't know what it's like.
One day you think you're one thing... and the next day you realize you're something else.
I feel like I'm Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
I'm in this new land and I want to get home... but something is telling me maybe this is my home.
Maybe I shouldn't click my heels three times.
Maybe I should just stay here and be nauseous with the Munchkins.
What scares you most about this whole thing?
That I'll lose Sam and he'll never talk to me again.
Well, why would Sam even care?
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset I kissed his wife.
- Whoa!
- [ Gasps ]
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God.
Y-You're looking pale.
Maybe you should take some deep breaths.
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a wreck.
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque, begging for forgiveness.
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.
I think we need to talk about this on level ground.
You're not thinking straight.
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?
No.
What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.
You were so jealous of Charlie... that you subconsciously tried to sabotage Sam's marriage.
Read my lips.
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...
- and my heart's telling me-
- Actually, our time is up for today.
Now, forget about Sam and get out there and date.
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?
Now, I will see you next week at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
Nice climb.
[ Exhales ]
My hotel is open.
I have suites,junior suites, deluxe accommodations available.
- Hey. [ Chuckles ]
- Hey.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
You know, actually, my grandfather once told me it's much nicer to say...
"That outfit looks very becoming on you."
- Well, thanks to you and your pops.
- [ Laughs ]
Whoa.
That coffee smells great.
I'm on this no-caffeine kick right now... but I still find myself hanging around Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.
[ Chuckles ] Actually, it's not all coffee.
It's one-third coffee, one-third cocoa, one-third chai... with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.
- Wow.
That's a new one. [ Chuckles ] - [ Chuckles ]
[ Inaudible ]
- What was that?
- Mmm
- Nothing.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
- Wow.
That-That took guts.
- [ Laughs ]
Would you?
Sure.
What time?
- Um, Raoul's at 1 0:00.
- All right.
Well, I'll see you then.
- [Elevator Bell Dings ]
- Great.
Are you going up?
- Down.
- Okay.
See you tonight.
- Oh!
- Are-Are you okay?
- [ Chuckles ] - [ Indistinct ]
- Is anything sprained?
Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
[ Sighs ]
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, you know, I'm a pretty busy guy.
I'm usually booked up every night.
I'd have to- I'd have to check my schedule.
- Yeah!
Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.
- [ Sighs ]
- Cool.
[Bell Dings ]
[ Sam ] Hey, Gray.
Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?
Oh, you did some serious
- Oh!
Damage.
Holy smokes.
Look at you.
What's the occasion?
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?
Yeah.
I got a 8:00 dinner with one, and I got a 1 0:00 dinner with the other.
That's great.
Did you get that rash you always get before you go out?
- No.
Why did you remind me?
-Just trying to help.
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?
I wanted to check in, see when you thought you might get your own place.
I know we get along great, and Charlie loves you... but we are newlyweds so I thought you might- [ Clucks Tongue ]
Do you know how hard it is to find a rent-controlled place in the city?
Why do I have to be the one to move?
One, the lease is in my name, and, two, I found the apartment.
'Cause a 90-year-old woman died on your shift at the hospital.
Her body wasn't even cold before you were calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.
I didn't hear you complaining.
As a matter of fact, you went to her funeral.
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean like you.
You can't kick me out.
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.
I'm just saying maybe you should start looking, that's all.
- I hate you!
I really do.
- Hey, hey!
Hey!
I can hear you guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?
- I wasn't yelling.
She was yelling.
- I was.
I hate him!
- Why?
What did he do now?
- Me?
- That's a little presumptuous, don't you think?
- He's kicking me out.
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.
We'll get our own place once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.
- Until then, it's fine.
I actually kind of like it.
- You do?
Yeah.
It's fun.
I love living with the both of you.
- What's wrong?
- Shit.
[ Chuckles ]
She has a couple of dates tonight...
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.
Hey.
I think- I don't know if you remember me...
- but I think you drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida... and when you refer to Ginger's companion... you're not talking about sushi or wasabi.
- Not bad.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Where's that funny accent of yours from?
- Oh... a funny place called Scotland.
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.
- Hmm.
How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.
I've had two auditions so far.
The first one was for the lead in a tampon spot- the role of the tampon, of course- and then, uh, the second one was a voice-over... for a pest-control infomercial.
And I didn't get that part.
They, uh-They said that they thought roaches didn't have accents.
I begged to differ, but I didn't want to seem argumentative.
Hmm.
- [ Sniffing ]
- Don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say?
I am a mess.
You don't look like a mess.
You look as cute as a button.
And buttons aren't messy.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
You know, back home in Scotland, I was captain of the local football team.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
And all my mates used to come to me with their problems.
They said I was pretty good.
So-
I'm all ears if you want to talk to someone from the outside, you know?
Hmm.
That's sweet, but it would take all night to tackle my laundry list.
Thanks.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.
And I'm counting the minutes until I see you again.
- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.
We get paid to steal other people's lines.
See ya.
Uh, seriously, though-
Could I give you a lift home tonight?
I could come and fetch you about, say., just before midnight.
No charge.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.
With three olives and a tiny splash of vermouth.
- Okay.
- And just a hint- a hint- of salt on the rim.
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Tonight we have a braised lamb shank... marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.
That's served with a creamed pumpkin squash.
We also have a grilled halibut steak... in a soy, tamari lemon-zest glaze.
And that comes with grilled seaweed and an orange and almond salad.
Do we know what we'd like?
Yes.
I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin squash and the rosemary-lime sauce... and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck comfit.
Excellent.
Coming right up.
Conrad, I'm impressed.
You duked the guy.
I didn't know you had it in you.
There's a lot in me that you don't know about.
I'm a burnin'sex machine just waitin' to be used and abused by you.
The harder, the better.
- [ Barks ]
- Check, please.
...as much as I can, but it's not good.
- [ Gray.] How?
- I don't know.
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.
So you love Capra... you run in the park, you tango... you live for Italy, and you hate asparagus.
Are you sure we weren't separated at birth?
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies... every Thursday since I was 15.
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.
Closed hand, deuces wild.
I love it when you talk dirty.
This is actually fun.
I have to admit.
I usually dread the whole first-date thing.
You know, the awkward lulls in the conversation.
Then the anxious pain in the pit of my stomach when I can't wait... for the night to end, but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.
Yeah, I'm feeling rather painless and "lull-less" myself.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
But, uh, I do want to be honest with you about something.
Oh, no.
Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.
[ Chuckles ]
See, I was so flattered with the way you asked me out in the elevator.
- I know.
Don't tell me.
You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married... but Stewart and I have been living together for years.
- Yeah.
- Stewart-
- Am I a moron or what?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- I can't help it.
I'm hopeless.
- You're not.
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.
All you need is some space... some fresh air and some perspective.
Fresh air, space and perspective in New York City.
Stick with me.
[ Gray.] This is unbelievable.
[ Cabdriver] Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah, it's one of the perks of the job.
I give Jimmy the doorman free rides... and he lets me come up here whenever I fancy.
[ Inhales ] I love this city.
- Oh, me too.
-[Laughs ]
You know, it's funny., 'cause sometimes, up here... everything is so tall and grand.
Even my biggest problems, you know... suddenly seem very wee.
Within seconds they just melt away like tiny dewdrops.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.
Ah, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist.
[ Exhales ] I've been wanting to do that... from the moment I saw your face in my rear view mirror.
What's wrong?
Oh, Christ.
Was it awful?
I-I'm a wee bit out of practice.
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.
- Well, thank you.
- [ Laughs ]
Your lips seem... nice and supple too.
But I'm sensing that, uh-
[ Exhales ] your heart's not doing the Riverdance thing that mine is.
Gordy, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- For what?
For being me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.
I happen to think you're pretty dandy.
So you're gay.
Big deal.
- How did you know?
-Just a feeling, I suppose.
That and the fact that you haven't shut up about Charlie all night.
And every time you mentioned her name you got that little... sparkle thing in your eyes.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.
That's easy.
You're gonna move on with your life... start being the person that you're supposed to be... instead of wasting your time pretending to be someone that you're not.
I mean, crikey.
Are you not exhausted?
I am, but it's so much easier to keep pretending.
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!
Isn't it?
[ Laughs ]
As your newfound friend...
I am prescribing a remedy for you.
That's part of the remedy.
This is the remedy.
"I am woman.
Hear me roar."
Helen Reddy.
She'll sort you out.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
[Man On TV] There are a few things I'd like to know about you too.
[Woman On TV] All right.
What would you like to know?
[ Man ] Oh, just about anything.
Things you like.
Things you don't like.
Where you went to school.
Who was your first beau.
What you want out of life.
- Mmm.
That's a tall order.
Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.
- Till the Clouds Roll By..
- I guess I like what every.one likes.
That's one of my favorite all time movies.
I know every line and every step.
Me too.
-
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thank you.
No.
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.
Will you dance with me?
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.
- Do you know this dance?
- Yeah.
-
-
[Door Opens ]
- What's goin' on?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.
Sorry.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?
-
I heard that.
Huh?
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?
[ Both Chuckling ]
Mmm.
She's the best.
Strong, independent, feisty.
- Who are you talking about?
- Who else?
Queen Oprah.
Oprah.
Oprah the Great.
Oprah
- I love her.
Do you understand that I'm obsessed with her?
Like, I think she is so great that she should start her own religion.
I love her so much that if she and Steadman... couldn't have children and needed a little bit of help...
I would surrogate a child for them.
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.
Wow.
That's a lot of love.
Last night I was so inspired after watching her show about loving your body that-
- Do you know what I did today?
- What?
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!
Yeah!
Can you believe it?
I quit.
Fergie, "smergie."
I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.
And if Dereck isn't going to love me for the tiny amount... of cellulite I have on the back of my thighs...
- then fuck him
- Screw that guy.
- Yeah.
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Hot!
- Thank you.
I mean, why.does our society.push us... to be perpetually.uncomfortable with who we are?
It's so messed up.
You wanna know why?
Here.
This is why.
" Boost your buttocks in five days."
" Luscious liposuction." "The flawless face-lift."
That's why.
Enough is enough.
We need to stop letting society.and-and media... and our religious leaders delegate who we are.
You're amazing, and I 'm even more amazing... and anybody who doesn't get it can go screw themselves!
[ Moans ]
[ Sighs ] That felt fantastic.
Spewing is a wonderful thing.
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.
That's what they should have.
[ Moans ]
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.
What are you doing here?
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.
This better be good.
I'm about to get prepped for surgery.
What is it?
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.
Maybe you should just get prepped for surgery-
Maybe you should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.
Gray.
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.
It's really major, and I don't know how to say it.
- Why don't you take three short breaths and one-
- One long.
[ Puffing ]
- I'm gay.
- What?
- As in Marvin.
- What?
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray," and
- Bingo!
Oh.
- [ Exhales ] - [ Exhales ]
- That's great.
- What about it is great?
- It's great that you're coming out.
- Don't tell me you knew.
[Chuckling] Gray., of course I knew.
How can you know when I didn't even know?
I'm smarter than you.
I've known since second grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?
Tell you, I'm proud of you, Gray.
- This is a big moment.
This is huge.
- It's big, all right... but there's one other thing I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.
Bigger.
Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.
- Well, I guess it depends on how you see it.
- What is it?
- I'm in love with her.
- Who?
- Her.
- Who her?
- Your wife.
- Whose wife?
Yours.
I'm in love with Charlie.
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would never joke about it.
I love the way she talked and walked and looked and felt... but it really kicked in after we kissed.
Kissed?
What do you mean, kissed?
Are you saying you kissed my wife?
Only once, and technically she wasn't your wife.
It was the night before your wedding.
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.
Just tell me off.
Just yell at me.
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
Gray, I want you to pack up your shit and get it out of the apartment... by the time I get home tonight, because we're done.
All right?
We're done.
[Charlie ] There has to be a reason.
Why would she move out without talking to us about it... or even telling us where she was going?
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?
It's not supposed to mean anything.
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.
Aren't you happy we'll have the place to ourselves?
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?
Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- What aren't you telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird.
You love your sister.
Yes, I love my sister.
How about you?
Do you love my sister?
Of course I love your sister.
I think she's great.
"Great." How great?
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You know what?
I'm late.
I gotta go, okay?
I'll see you later.
Sam?
-
-
-
So as you can see, the consumers love to think of nothing but C-Pro.
- B-Pro.
- What?
- B-Pro.
You said "C-Pro."
- I did?
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass of water.
Take your time.
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.
- [ Groans ]
- Gray, hang in there.
You're doing just fine.
- No, I'm not doing fine.
I'm the Titanic.
- No!
- Yes.
- You just gotta-You gotta get focused.
You gotta center yourself, and you gotta march back in there... and you show them who's the boss.
Who's the Boss?
I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light had really weird hair, but-
Gray!
You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?
You gotta get out of your head and get into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Center yourself.
[ Exhales ]
- And go.
- Go.
Go.
[Lana ] Gimme a '"P."Gimme an '"R. "
Gimme an "O."
What's that spell?
B-Pro!
Yeah!
Whoo!
[ Giggling ]
Lana, what the hell are you doing?
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative executive on the Bartlett account... because I thought it would be best to show Julia two perspectives.
- You mean the one of her tits and the one of her ass?
- Gray!
I'm sure that Lana has 36 double-D ideas... for the account, and I'll just give you your privacy to fondle through them.
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.
I'm sure it cost me my job.
Well, with copy like that, they should be begging you to stay.
Here.
Drink that while it's still hot.
That, young lady, is my granny's secret recipe.
Mmm!
This is so good.
What's in this?
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey and a wee bit of nutmeg.
Gordy.,you are amazing.
You barely know me and you're such a great friend.
You're gonna make some lucky girl very happy one day.
So are you.
God, everything is so complicated.
If it was 30 years ago, I could just move away and join a convent.
- Those outfits are so hideous.
- [ Chuckles ]
You know, if you want my advice- and I don't suppose you do, but I'm going to give it to you anyway.
- I think-you have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?
You have to tell her the truth.
- I can't do that.
- Yes,you can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I mean, for all you know, she might feel the same way about you.
Come on.
Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.
But you won't know that until you talk to her.
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?
What if you go through your entire life saying, "What if?"
What happens if she does feel the same way?
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.
- He doesn't talk to you now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.
And do you foresee that ever changing?
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm.Just drink your tea.
This is so good.
Are you sure this is just tea, nutmeg and honey?
Wee bit of whiskey.
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!
What kind of shortbread is this?
- Mmm, short.
- [ Chuckles ]
[Gray.] God, they.'re so beautiful and magical and peaceful.
Will they.have babies here?
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality among mammals.
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales... but did you know that over 50% of elephants are gay?
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People... over loudspeakers and watch their feet.
- I'm kidding.
- [ Laughs ]
So where've you been hiding?
I've left three messages and no answer, and Sam won't say a word.
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.
Anything you want to talk about?
Do you remember that night we spent together in Las Vegas before you got married to Sam?
Barely.
I mean, I remember having a great time... but I think you got me too drunk to remember anything else.
Why?
Did I say something really stupid?
- It's not what you said.
- God.
What did I do?
I don't know if you did anything.
It might have just been me.
- Oh, my God.
I remember.
- You do?
- Yes.
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.
How could you let your brother marry me?
I didn't know if you were conscious of what was going on.
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?
I sounded like a cat in heat, didn't I?
Is that what you think we're talking about?
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?
- No.
That was it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.
Did you try to convince Sam not to marry me?
There was no convincing him.
Trust me.
If I could have, I would have.
You know, every morning I wake up before Sam does... and I just watch him.
I just lie there and stare.
And I love the way his nose wrinkles when he's dreaming... and the little purring sound that he makes when he's about to wake up.
And the way that he keeps his hand on my thigh the whole night... just to let me know that he's there.
And I know it may seem crazy.... but love is crazy, isn't it?
[ Laughing ] It sure is.
[ Woman Singing Pop ]
[Door Opens ] [ Continues ]
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?
You're so lucky..
I never had a brother or sister.
Oh!
[ Groans ]
[ Continues ]
I don't know what's going on between the two of you... but you have to work it out, Sam.
Just talk to her.
[ Continues ]
[ Ends ]
[ Chuckling]
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah.
Gray.
Seems Julia wasn't thrilled with the way our last presentation went.
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated or patronized anymore.
- Actually, I was gonna give you a promotion, but-
- What?
I asked Jordan to make you the executive creative director on my account... and to give you free rein to do whatever you want.
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea was yours.
I think you have great ideas.
You just haven't been given the freedom to explore them fully.
I like your energy, your spunk, your candidness... and I think with the right support... you're gonna give me exactly what I'm looking for.
Wow!
- I don't know what to say.
- [Woman On Intercom ] Sorry to interrupt, Gray.... but your 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics is in the small conference room.
Oh, I don't have a 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics.
They said they confirmed it with your office.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.
Isn't she adorable?
[ Chuckles ]
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't have you in my book.
Hey.
See, you forgot your toothbrush... and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard, part soft bristles... must be hard to come by.
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?
And to say I'm sorry.
I overreacted- Little bit.
Not a lot.
Little bit.
After all, you have to admit... it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...
I'm not quite sure why I got so surprised... 'cause if you think about it... it's almost inevitable that you and I would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?
You're acting- You're acting very rational.
It's too rational.
You used to do this when we were kids.
Then I'd turn around and you'd tackle me.
I should be getting my knees in the lock-down position.
You know, Gray-
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.
You know that, right?
Being without you I feel like one half of me is missing.
Lately I've been feeling very lopsided.
- Oh, Sam.
-Just 'cause you're totally gay... and in love with my wife doesn't mean we can't work things out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.
Now, this is good.
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!
[ Gray Squeals ]
- [ Gray whimpering ] Oh, my- - [ Sam ] Gray!
Gray!
Gray!
How ya doin'?
How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.
Put your eyes back in your heads.
[ Whimpering ]
[Bell Dings ]
- Hey, what- - [Alarm Bell Ringing]
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.
- I never wanna see another human being ever again.
- No.
Look.
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad-
Who cares what those people think?
I care.
They're probably calling Jerry Springer right now as we speak.
No.
No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For having to be related to me.
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel- [ Groans ]
Gray, look.
You're just- You're just coming out, okay?
- I am never coming out of this elevator.
- This is probably... the biggest revelation of your entire life.
It's normal to be going nuts.
- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.
I don't feel any of those things.
Well, how do you feel?
- Lonely.
- Why?
Because I'm never gonna be able to walk down the street... holding hands with my partner... without the rest of the world giving us a look.
I may never have the wedding that I once dreamed of... and I may never have children... and one day, when I die... people will never give as much respect to my grieving lover... as if she were my husband.
Gray...
- it's not as if you made a choice.
- [Sobs ]
That's what terrifies me.
It's so much easier to be someone else.
Do you remember when we were kids- you would have been about six- and Dad came home to tell Mom he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.
Yeah.
Remember we stayed in the closet all night... just cuddled up like two little mice and... listened to their whole fight.
I was... so angry.
I was... hurt.
I was just-
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there and kick his ass...
- and you remember what you said to me?
- Hmm.
You were just six... but you said it was gonna be okay... that Dad was not gonna live a lie... that he was gonna try and be happy... and that everyone deserved to be happy.
I said that?
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.
Why are you being so nice to me?
- You should hate me.
- For what?
For having good taste?
You never have to worry about it.
I mean, she's completely, madly, passionately... like cow-jump-over-the-moon in love with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great... for me.
Not so great for you.
But you're not gonna make me feel guilty for this are you?
Mm-mmm.
Gray, you know what?
You can't expect the first girl that you fall in love with... to love you back.
That's-That's not how it works.
That would be the equivalent of settling down when you were age 12.
You haven't gone through gay puberty yet.
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?
- No.
Of the elevator.
- Of the elevator.
[ Carrie ] I should have broken up with Dereck ages ago.
I am having the best time.
- So what about you?
Have you met anyone yet?
- Not yet.
Really?
Girls should be lining up around the block for you.
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blond, short, tall?
It depends, I guess.
- Funny.
You need funny.
- Funny would be good.
- And stylish.
No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.
And for the love of God, don't wind up... with one of those ladies who doesn't believe in waxing.
- You're killing me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
- Have you ever been attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
- Not even a little?
- No.
- Huh.
Oh.
Not even last year, when I was in shape after taking those Pilate's classes?
Or last week when I wore that pink Marc Jacobs dress to work... and you told me how cute I looked?
You looked so cute.
You are cute, but, you know, not cute that way, cute.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's so depressing.
It's not like I'm into girls, but if I was a girl who was into girls...
I'd definitely be into me, 'cause I think I'm a catch.
You are a catch, but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.
Hmm.
But you said you don't have a type.
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.
Wait.
Don't you usually have therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?
Oh, my God.
I'm so late.
Shoot.
Okay.
You know, I don't really want to go, so watch this.
[ Beeping ]
Sydney, it's Gray.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't wanna go to the batting cages... and I don't wanna go rock climbing or bowling or anywhere with you... 'cause I'm feeling really good about myself... and I don't think you're a very good therapist for me, so you're fired.
- Thank you, and have a nice day.
- [ Laughs ]
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?
That was amazing.
[ Exhales ] Do you want to get a mani-pedi before we go back to work?
- Sure.
I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.
What if I dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?
- Yes.
- Really?
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!
[Woman Vocalizing]
[Disco beat]
[Woman Vocalizing]
I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?
Because you're gay, and you have to start behaving' like it.
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?
No, but you haven't had sex with a woman yet... and, you know, that's like being black... and never having listened to the Jackson Five... or being Jewish and never having a knish... or being Indian and never having had a curry or being-
Or being Scottish and not keeping your mouth shut?
- I suppose so.
Come on.
- Hi.
Sorry.
No men allowed.
Wh
- Isn't that against the law?
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.
- No exceptions.
No men.
- Forget it.
Well, just go in by yourself.
I can't go in by myself.
Are you kidding?
I have an idea.
[ In Falsetto] I would like an Apricot Sour, please.
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.
And a touch of lemon and a squeeze of lime.
And a little bit of sugar on the rim.
Comin' up.
Apricot Sour?
I thought that was what you women drank, for Christ's sakes.
- One of your eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.
Hi.
Can I buy you a drink?
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.
See, but thanks.
You don't?
- Shut up.
- [ Giggling ]
This is quite tasty, actually.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.
Hey, give it a minute.
Oh, my.God. It's Julia Bartlett.
- Quick, quick.
I gotta get out of here.
- Why?
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello.
Is there anybody in?
No.
Her?
You think?
Gray, did your mom ever tell you... what your I.Q. scores were?
[ Chuckles ]
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.
I'm just taking a break from working on your account.
Gray, I didn't come over here to check up on you.
[ Both laughing ]
Um, hello.
Uh, my name's Georgette.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
And, uh, lovely.
And I'm just gonna leave you two to, uh- to, uh- to catch up on everything.
- Mmm.
Lovely.
- Don't go.
Yeah, it was lovely to see you too.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Dutch way-Three kisses.
So, uh-
Fine.
It's fine.
I'm fine.
You're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, and I've got to go now.
Bye.
You really surprised me the other day.
I had no idea you were gay.
[ Exhales ] That makes two of us.
You're not just coming out, are you?
Put it this way.
My hotel's been closed for a long time... but tonight's the grand opening.
There have been a few fake openings... but tonight's the real deal.
[ Laughs ] I
- No, I don't understand.
[ Whispering ] Yes, I'm just coming out.
[ Whispering ] I don't think anyone in here will mind.
[ Both Laughing ]
You really are adorable.
I always thought so.
Really?
From day one, in that little cream, pin-striped suit you were wearing.
I like that suit too.
I think I got it at, uh, Banana Republic.
Or maybe it was, uh, Emporio Armani.
Actually, it could have been Barneys, but the shirt was from Bloomies.
Listen.
I have this beautiful bottle of cognac... that I just brought back from France, and I would-
- I 'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?
No.
My place.
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.
Uh, okay, well-
[ Exhales ] I like cognac.
I like cognac.
I like brandy too.
Usually I have a little cognac with a splash of brandy on the side.
I have brandy too.
[ Laughs ]
[ Woman Singing Pop ]
[ Squeals ]
[ Continues ]
- Give it up.
You're toast.
- You're gonna eat those words.
[ Charlie ] Come on, Gray!
Come on!
[ Both Cheering ]
- [ Cheering ] - [ Continues ]
[ Ends ]
[Slow piano intro ]
[ Woman singing ]
[ Continues ]
[ Ends ]
What are you doing?
Come back.
- No.
- Come on.
Turn around.
Hey, hey!
You're the best.
You're amazing.
What do you say?
Beers on me.
Cold beers on me.
Let's go!
Wonderful.
Weren't they wonderful?
Come on.
Keep it going, Gray.
- Hey.
- Help!
- Okay.
- Help.
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?
- Yeah.
Mmm.
- What do you got?
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.
- And chicken.
- Good.
- And fish.
- And fish.
- And tofu.
- Good.
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great.
We got tempeh.
Then I got the regular essentials, like asparagus and lettuce.
I got it.
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay?
Let's—
Hello?
Hey, Carrie.
Who?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, honey.
- Dinner?
No.
We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.
- We go out.
I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.
Do you want something fruity or full-bodied and do—
Okay.
Okay.
What— Californian, French, Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span—
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have to yell.
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.
That is amazing.
Oh, my God.
Carrie.
Do you believe this?
Ta-da!
I would like to say something.
To Carrie and Dereck and their lovely friends.
Oh, my goodness.
I don't know what it means, but it sounded beautiful.
- It's a fake accent.
He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?
- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.
And poofs are rarely beefy.
I wrote a piece about that in a magazine once.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Carrie, do you have the new Liza Minnelli CD?
- Mmm.
Okay, and scratch my last comment.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.
- Oh, uh, more for you, yeah?
- Yes.
- Red or white?
- I'll have red.
Actually, I'll have white.
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.
- All right.
- Um, well, Julia Bartlett is not an easygoing client.
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.
Oh, honey.
- Doesn't mean you're getting a promotion before me.
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what do you do?
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital... with a specialty in, uh— heart transplants.
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.
And how long have you two been together?
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.
Thirty years.
- I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- No.
- Gray's my sister.
Oh, my God!
No!
Ick!
No, I'm—
I just— I thought that you two were an item.
Well, I just—
- What?
These-These two?
- Well, yeah.
You seem so—
So?
I don't know.
So together, I guess.
Hey, what'd I miss?
- Um, she thinks we're together.
- Like "together"together?
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!
You're not the first one to think that, Elaine.
- Let me tell you.
- What?
- They're very codependent.
- We are not!
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart.
But if that's—
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.
How about that— Remember?
You want to know something?
I've even seen them share the same toothbrush.
- One time.
- Oh, ick.
- One time is— it's creepy.
- L— Listen.
I think that your relationship is charming.
- Thank you.
- Have you ever French-kissed?
That's beautiful.
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?
You know, the sisters that were 103 and 105, and they never got married... and they just did yoga and headstands together every day.
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.
- I'm serious.
We need to venture out.
- To where?
When?
I'm too busy to date, and I'm not goin' to bars.
The girls there, all they do is they talk about how fat they are.
They're not fat.
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.
You know what I want?
I want a girl who's not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay... and have no guilt attached, that's what I want.
Can't you meet a cute intern at the hospital?
Wrong.
Can't do it.
Too dangerous.
You can't have sexual tension and cut an artery.
It's awkward.
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl for you, and you look for a guy for me...
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers is one of the Spice Giris.
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.
Somebody who doesn't think Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.
Someone who would call me an hour after our first date and say...
"I am crazy about you, and I'm counting the minutes until I could see you again."
That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.
Eatin' with your fingers, things.
It's quite festive.
Hey, Jimmy.
Happy birthday!
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry about that.
Hey, Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
My Weight Watchers meeting went over, and it was too good to leave.
Why do you still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.
He has nerve.
He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know.
Right?
But trust me.
The entertainment factor alone is worth it.
Today, it was so crazy.
There was this woman who was all mad at her husband for not letting her have dessert.
So she breaks into the Soho Chocolate Factory... and tried to drown herself in a vat of chocolate.
- No.
- Yes.
- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka?
- Exactly.
It's like the cuckoo show.
Ooh, let's see who's in Page Six today.
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes... with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds like a crossing guard wrote it.
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.
- It's so cool and kitsch.
Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana?
Don't listen to Lana.
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?
I do think she does a lot more than just type for him.
- Give it up.
- Okay.
You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.
- Yeah.
- Lana—Wait, I feel like somebody's listening—
Lana goes to Kemiko, my pedicurist... and told her, who then told Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!
I know it's accurate gossip 'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me to do some research for him, so—
Oh, really?
Oh, that's too bad.
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Research my ass.
You mean her ass.
B
- Pro.
The campaign—
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.
It's on, sir.
Carry on, Gray.
The campaign exudes nostalgia, comedy... thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion all under one banner.
It'll appeal to a wide demographic and leads the consumer... with an emotional end benefit of feeling charged up.
To challenge themselves and seize the day and be the best they can be.
Whoo!
Well, Julia?
And I must say you look fantastic.
What do you think?
Great, no?
No.
- N-N-No?
- No.
Well, it's, uh—it's just an initial proposal.
I mean, it still needs to be tweaked and tuned.
You only tweak or tune if something has potential.
Uh, we'll, uh—we'll go back to the drawing board then, that's all.
Why don't you call me when you have something original to present?
Julia, I'm sure we have a bunch of— Shut that thing off.
I'm sure we have a bunch of things.
This is just one of them.
What's wrong with you?
That was crap.
J
- Julia, just a second.
I don't know, Sydney.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
How come every road I take turns out to be a dead end?
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.
At least with a fork there's a choice— right or left or east or west...
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you think you always reach these dead ends?
Ooh!
You see, gutter ball.
That's my life— a bunch of gutter balls.
Well, this is a perfect example... of why having therapy in different locations is so important.
Look at the deep symbolism in that gutter ball.
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.
Can you think of one word that best describes...
- the way your work situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?
- No, one.
- Um—
Ohh!
Frustrated.
- You're up.
- Right.
Okay, another word... for how you really feel when your brother wins all your races.
- Frustrated.
- Okay.
Another word for how you feel when you think about going on a date.
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.
I know.
But I can't help it.
It's a weird thing, but I see myself as this charming hotel... that's beautifully romantic and... wonderful on the outside... but on the inside, it just needs a ton of renovations.
Hence, closed for repairs.
Nice analogy.
What kinds of renovations?
Getting a promotion at work, perfecting the tango... disowning my mother, getting liposuction under my chin.
There's nothing worse than chin fat.
Uh, I think you need to... let the idea of sharing your life with someone other than your brother... enter your consciousness.
But how can I be conscious of something that I'm unconscious of?
It's not like I don't date.
I've had plenty of boyfriends.
Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.
Let's try something.
How about keeping the hotel closed... but keeping the veranda open for cocktails?
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front—
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out of time today... but we will resume this conversation next week at the rock climbing wall.
Nice game.
And what happened to going to a movie?
How are you going to meet anyone in a dark movie theater?
How are you going to meet anyone at a dog park?
Hello?
The dog park is a vortex for singles.
Hello?
When did we become dog owners?
No.
I wash my hand of this whole fiasco.
You're on your own.
Ow!
Grabbing.
- Check out center field.
- What about cen—Ahh!
Yes!
Holy... smokes.
I'll do the preinterview.
If she's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"
- And you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball."
- What?
- There's no way she's single.
- Do what I say.
- You know what?
Don't get bossy.
- Ow!
Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt.
Spazzy men are not attractive.
Some spazzy men are attractive.
- Gosh.
You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.
- Or should I say 21?
- She's legal.
Yeah.
I suppose I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?
Maybe a liver martini with a beefjerky twist?
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.
Originally Charlotte, but it always seemed too long and never quite suited me, so—
I'm Gray.
You can't really shorten that or it'd be "Gra."
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.
- Dancing?
Are you athletic?
- Uh—
- Do you watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well—
Do you have a boyfriend?
What is your favorite dessert?
Okay.
Um, uh—
Let's see.
I'm a 1940s movie buff.
I love to swing dance.
I've never been very good at sports... um, love the Discovery Channel, "nix-ay" on the boyfriend... and, well, it's kind of a toss-up.
I
- I like cheesecake, but I kind of love... those big, gooey hot fudge sundaes, so—
Get the ball.
Who's that?
Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute.
What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- Suki.
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.
Oh, well, you are so adorable.
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.
He's one— He's one-five.
He's 15.
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.
Sam.
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people... that illegally keeps endangered animals in their apartment, like that guy... that got caught with a leopard in his kitchen?
No.
I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at New York Aquarium.
- Ha!
That's a relief.
- Free Willy is my favorite movie.
Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.
And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.
Orca.
Orca not so much.
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.
I'm staying on a friend's sofa for right now.
I just moved here from San Francisco about three weeks ago.
- I love San Francisco.
- Really?
Have you spent much time there?
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.
I know I've never been to San Francisco, but I know I would love it.
Tony Bennett loves it.
He left his heart there.
I love Tony Bennett.
There you go.
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?
Yeah.
You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons, 'cause we love that dog.
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny.
Gypsy's not mine either.
I dog walk on the side for extra cash.
I should probably get her back, so—
Oh.
It was really nice to meet you both.
- Nice meeting you both—You.
- Nice meeting you.
- What are you waiting for?
- What?
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.
All right.
Uh, excuse me!
Since you're new in town, if you're not doing anything tonight, maybe you'djoin us?
We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine, if you'd like tojoin us.
I just said that.
Would you like to join us?
Three times.
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Okay.
¡:
Perfecto!
R
- R-R-ico.
R
- R-R-R-R.
R
- R-R-R-R-R-Rico.
Oh, easy, Pancho Villa.
These girls are conmigo.
More vino, por favor.
- ¡Ayayay, oh!
Gracias.
Gracias.
Carlos!
Cover me!
I'm goin' in.
Okay, best food movie.
- Like Water For Chocolate.
- Babette's Feast.
How about Babette's Feast?
- Okay.
- Okay, Fatso starring Dom DeLuise.
- Yes.
- Oh, good one.
Okay, is it me?
Let's see.
Uh, women you need to get away from.
Bette Davis in What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?
Ah, good one.
I got Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction for the rabbit.
- Kathy Bates in Misery.
- Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout, um, best screen kiss?
- Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.
- That's overrated, I think.
I'll go with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Notorious.
Okay.
I'll see your Notorious... and I'll raise you Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.
- Very good.
- Oh, wait.
I'll see your Doctor Zhivago... and I will raise you Lady and the Tramp in Lady and the Tramp.
Winner.
Winner.
The spaghetti pooch smooch.
Nothing better.
Thank God we're home.
My toes are even starting to swell.
I'm exhausted.
Dogs are barking?
No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.
I'm wide awake.
I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.
- Oh, yeah?
Me too.
You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.
Let's go to Soho House or Sway or like a diner or something.
Ow.
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?
Big meeting in the morning you have to get to?
Oh, that big meeting.
Actually, I'm pretty tired.
I should go to bed.
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay.
Good night.
I hope we can do this again.
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.
Night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got in late last night.
I didn't even hear you come in.
- I'm just getting in now.
- Sounds like you had a good time.
- It was more than good.
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.
Don't blow it.
You're off to a strong start, but a girl can sense a "glommer."
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes.
Glommer.
- I know.
I— Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy—
- I know she doesn't—
- She could think you're a glommer and you don't know.
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.
What?
And she said yes.
Can you believe it?
We got our blood work done this morning, and we're going to Vegas this weekend...
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?
I know.
It's amazing.
It's like— It's-It's-It's— It's incredible.
You know what she is?
She's— She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.
She's the jackpot.
She's it.
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.
You know what she isn't?
An ax murderer.
You know what she is?
Perfect.
She's perfect.
Gray, remember what Mom always used to say?
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me.
It's right.
Mom is divorced for the third time, and she lives in a commune.
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."
I'm notjealous of you when you're totally psychologically unstable.
I'm psychologically unstable?
I'm psyc— You're the one that said "Get the ball."
I said "Get the ball," not "Get the ring."
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend, and we are gonna get married.
You can come with us.
I booked you a room.
I booked you a flight.
If you come, great.
And if you don't, that's your deal.
- But you know what?
I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?
One minute you know someone, the next minute they're so desperate...
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.
She doesn't have a lot of friends in the city, and I thought it'd be fun for you two.
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.
If you want sexy, I got sexy.
I mean, I know you kids aren't Little Bo Peep underneath those dresses.
But... if you ask me... a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.
A beautiful bride, yes.
A glowing bride, of course.
But sexy is— I—
I just don't know.
Personally, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
Really?
Do you have anything in red with a slit up to the hip?
- Red!
- She's kidding.
Just something with a little less piff and poof and no lace.
Oh, no lace?
No problem.
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin... that is to die for.
Great.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Did you know that Sam cheats at Monopoly and he snores?
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I work with animals.
Hairy is a turn-on.
Honestly?
I was a goner the moment I saw him at the dog park.
There's just something about his impish smile and that twinkle in his eye.
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out of this thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.
Set them free.
Please tell me you don't wear stuff like that every day.
What?
Lingerie?
I love it.
I've spent more on lingerie than I have on rent.
I haven't bought a new pair of underwear in over four years.
- Eww.
That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don't you try a dress on?
- No.
- Come on.
This one's only 10,000.
No way, no way.
Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.
Come on.
It will be fun.
Try it on.
Forget about it.
No way.
Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.
No!
What if I damage it?
Shh.
Stay still while I get this zipper up.
Ohh!
Did you cover me?
I was at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?
Yep.
But I told him you were at the gynecologist getting a pap smear.
It shut him up.
- Good one.
- So what were you doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.
- No!
- Sorry.
I've been reading too many trashy magazines.
What?
He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
- No.
- Yes!
The wedding is this weekend.
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.
The worst thing is, I can't think of a reason why he shouldn't marry her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
She's amazing.
Oh, please!
She's a gold-digging wench trying to hook her little claws into a resident surgeon... before he makes the big bucks that she can later get her hands on... in an ugly, ugly, ugly divorce settlement... that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping on the side, will handle.
You're not still taping All My Children every day?
I TiVo it.
But seriously, you must be flipping out that Sam is getting married... leaving you all alone, completely single... with no real prospects in the future?
That's horrible.
I feel so bad for you.
Promise me if I ever call you when I'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.
Sure.
Here you go.
Can I get some change?
Kidding.
Don't spend it all on the slots.
Red 21.
This place is—This is awesome.
Check this out.
This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?
It's a satin-cotton blend.
Possibly Egyptian cotton if this is the high-roller room.
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.
'Cause you're not doin' any high rollin' in this bed till tomorrow.
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.
You're not supposed to see the bride until tomorrow morning.
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall that you booked for me.
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.
Besides, we haven't been apart in six whole days.
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.
What are you guys— What are you guys gonna do without me?
- None of your business.
See you at the chapel.
- Ow!
Violent.
You're gonna get socked.
Ow!
Ow!
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.
- Ninja claw!
Ohh!
- Hey!
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane.
We have to take a bath.
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.
- Exactly.
- Right.
I'll order two bottles.
Ta-da!
I hope you didn't greet the room service guy like that.
Hmm.
Is that why he said he didn't need a tip?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Please tell me you work out three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hate you.
If I told you I had acne until I was 21, would that make you feel better?
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.
My nickname was "Connect the Dots."
I have a toast.
To my soon-to-be sister-in-law and my newfound friend—
That's a bathing suit you're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, are you?
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good since I was 17.
I'm not taking off a thing.
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know if I should.
- You should.
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.
Though I did get kicked out of the Brownies for stealing money out of my cookie account.
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.
Relations as in intercourse.
I decided to wait, and I don't know if that was a mistake.
I mean, what if he's too big or if I'm too small or—
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you to test drive a car before you buy it?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Well...
I love Vegas, and I am certain that Vegas loves me... because I lost a bundle on the slots last night.
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know.
I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.
For my next number, I'd like to give a warm welcome to my surprise guest— the delightful and charming Miss Charlie Kelsey.
Yeah!
- You didn't.
- Did.
- You didn't!
- Did.
- Why?
- Ooh!
Come on, honey.
How are you feeling this evening, Charlie?
Like I could throw up at any minute.
Well, that doesn't sound too pleasant.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean because of you.
I— Can I just sit down, please?
Not too fast.
Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble... to hear you sing a number with me tonight.
#Twelve # There, I sang a number.
I'm going home.
Come on, girlfriend.
I think we can do this.
We can do this.
We can do this.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I can't believe I lost that much money.
Don't tell Sam.
- He liked you too.
- Why did that—
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.
Ah.
My wedding shoes.
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.
- Can't.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
I'll help you.
- Mmm!
Sleeping.
Oh.
Here.
Here's a shirt.
Do you think the woman was mad... when I asked to see her husband's tattoo on his tush?
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.
I still don't know if it was a ship or a— a bunny.
Did I tell you how happy I am you're gonna be my sister-in-law?
- About 17 times.
- Well, I mean it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that just happened.
How can this be happening?
You're marrying my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.
Oh, this can't be happening.
This is just a mistake.
A meaningless, too-much-tequila mistake.
Oh, my God!
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.
You're already dressed?
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?
Don't you think we should talk?
Okay.
Can we talk while I get ready?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I guess.
- Great.
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.
- Are you really upset?
- Yeah.
I would be too if it were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.
I know it was one of those crazy, spontaneous moments... but don't you feel weird at all?
Not really.
I mean, I know it may seem strange...
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural.
I feel subnatural.
In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.
But if I phone home, Sam would answer, and that wouldn't be good.
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?
Gray, come on.
Sit down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Anyone would tell you the exact same thing.
It is 100% normal to be feeling upset, sad, freaked out.
In fact, considering everything...
I think you're handling the whole thing really well.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Your brother is getting married... and deep down inside you feel like you're losing him.
That's why you think I'm freaking out?
You think I'm having separation anxiety?
There's only one thing that can keep a marriage together... and that is love.
Oh.
As the lucky messenger of our Lord and Savior above...
I look to the two of you with your bright smiles of devotion... and promise of commitment here in the very house of the Lord above!
- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask... if there's anybody here who has any objection whatsoever... to the union of these two lovebirds.
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Go ahead.
As I was saying... if there's anybody here who has an objection to the union... of these two love angels, speak their piece now.
Oh, my God!
Look out!
Your hiccups gone?
- Actually, yes.
- Good.
Great.
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.
- Right?
- Right.
Then by the power vested in me by the glorious state of Nevada...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.
Hi.
I'd like a hot dog with kraut on one side and relish on the other... with ketchup on the kraut and mustard on the relish, but don't let the two touch.
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency.
Call me.
Now reach to your right.
Station your left leg on the rock in the middle.
All right, Gray, what's really going on?
I canceled a session with someone today because you said it was an emergency.
- It is.
- Well, then?
Take a deep breath—
And tell me what's going on.
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine.
Then do that.
- I think I'm gay.
- What was that?
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?
It's like this.
For years, I thought I was content being single... and I wasn't really interested in a relationship.
I thought that when Mr. Right came into my life, he just would.
He— He wouldn't need some fancy invitation.
He wouldjust arrive.
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right I'm waiting for.
It's Mrs. Right.
- Oh.
- And I think I found her.
And I kissed her—
And I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
But I know that I liked it.
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.
Why do you think you feel nauseous?
Do you think you committed some terrible sin just because you kissed a girl?
Why?
If you're two consenting adults, what's so terrible about that?
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.
Oh, so you believe you forced her to kiss you?
No.
No, not at all.
She kissed me.
- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.
Y
- You don't know what it's like.
One day you think you're one thing... and the next day you realize you're something else.
I feel like I'm Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
I'm in this new land and I want to get home... but something is telling me maybe this is my home.
Maybe I shouldn't click my heels three times.
Maybe I should just stay here and be nauseous with the Munchkins.
What scares you most about this whole thing?
That I'll lose Sam and he'll never talk to me again.
Well, why would Sam even care?
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset I kissed his wife.
Whoa!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God.
Y
- You're looking pale.
Maybe you should take some deep breaths.
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a wreck.
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque, begging for forgiveness.
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.
I think we need to talk about this on level ground.
You're not thinking straight.
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?
No.
What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.
You were so jealous of Charlie... that you subconsciously tried to sabotage Sam's marriage.
Read my lips.
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...
- and my heart's telling me—
- Actually, our time is up for today.
Now, forget about Sam and get out there and date.
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?
Now, I will see you next week at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
Nice climb.
My hotel is open.
I have suites, junior suites, deluxe accommodations available.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
You know, actually, my grandfather once told me it's much nicer to say...
"That outfit looks very becoming on you."
Well, thanks to you and your pops.
Whoa.
That coffee smells great.
I'm on this no-caffeine kick right now... but I still find myself hanging around Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.
Actually, it's not all coffee.
It's one-third coffee, one-third cocoa, one-third chai... with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.
Wow.
That's a new one.
- What was that?
- Mmm— Nothing.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Wow.
That—That took guts.
Would you?
Sure.
What time?
- Um, Raoul's at 10:00.
- All right.
Well, I'll see you then.
Great.
Are you going up?
- Down.
- Okay.
See you tonight.
- Oh!
- Are-Are you okay?
- Is anything sprained?
Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, you know, I'm a pretty busy guy.
I'm usually booked up every night.
I'd have to— I'd have to check my schedule.
- Yeah!
Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.
Cool.
Hey, Gray.
Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?
Oh, you did some serious— Oh!
Damage.
Holy smokes.
Look at you.
What's the occasion?
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?
Yeah.
I got a 8:00 dinner with one, and I got a 10:00 dinner with the other.
That's great.
Did you get that rash you always get before you go out?
- No.
Why did you remind me?
- Just trying to help.
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?
I wanted to check in, see when you thought you might get your own place.
I know we get along great, and Charlie loves you... but we are newlyweds so I thought you might—
Do you know how hard it is to find a rent-controlled place in the city?
Why do I have to be the one to move?
One, the lease is in my name, and, two, I found the apartment.
'Cause a 90-year-old woman died on your shift at the hospital.
Her body wasn't even cold before you were calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.
I didn't hear you complaining.
As a matter of fact, you went to her funeral.
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean like you.
You can't kick me out.
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.
I'm just saying maybe you should start looking, that's all.
- I hate you!
I really do.
- Hey, hey!
Hey!
I can hear you guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?
- I wasn't yelling.
She was yelling.
- I was.
I hate him!
- Why?
What did he do now?
- Me?
- That's a little presumptuous, don't you think?
- He's kicking me out.
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.
We'll get our own place once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.
- Until then, it's fine.
I actually kind oflike it.
- You do?
Yeah.
It's fun.
I love living with the both of you.
- What's wrong?
- Shit.
She has a couple of dates tonight...
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.
Hey.
I think— I don't know if you remember me...
- but I think you drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida... and when you refer to Ginger's companion... you're not talking about sushi or wasabi.
Not bad.
- Where's that funny accent of yours from?
- Oh... a funny place called Scotland.
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.
- Hmm.
How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.
I've had two auditions so far.
The first one was for the lead in a tampon spot— the role of the tampon, of course— and then, uh, the second one was a voice-over... for a pest-control infomercial.
And I didn't get that part.
They, uh—They said that they thought roaches didn't have accents.
I begged to differ, but I didn't want to seem argumentative.
Hmm.
Don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say?
I am a mess.
You don't look like a mess.
You look as cute as a button.
And buttons aren't messy.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
You know, back home in Scotland, I was captain of the local football team.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
And all my mates used to come to me with their problems.
They said I was pretty good.
So—
I'm all ears if you want to talk to someone from the outside, you know?
Hmm.
That's sweet, but it would take all night to tackle my laundry list.
Thanks.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.
And I'm counting the minutes until I see you again.
- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.
We get paid to steal other people's lines.
See ya.
Uh, seriously, though—
Could I give you a lift home tonight?
I could come and fetch you about, say, just before midnight.
No charge.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.
With three olives and a tiny splash of vermouth.
- Okay.
- And just a hint— a hint— of salt on the rim.
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Tonight we have a braised lamb shank... marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.
That's served with a creamed pumpkin squash.
We also have a grilled halibut steak... in a soy-tamari lemon-zest glaze.
And that comes with grilled seaweed and an orange and almond salad.
Do we know what we'd like?
Yes.
I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin squash and the rosemary-lime sauce... and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.
Excellent.
Coming right up.
Conrad, I'm impressed.
You duked the guy.
I didn't know you had it in you.
There's a lot in me that you don't know about.
I'm a burnin'sex machine just waitin'to be used and abused by you.
The harder, the better.
Check, please.
...as much as I can, but it's not good.
- How?
- I don't know.
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.
So you love Capra... you run in the park, you tango... you live for Italy, and you hate asparagus.
Are you sure we weren't separated at birth?
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies... every Thursday since I was 15.
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.
Closed hand, deuces wild.
I love it when you talk dirty.
This is actually fun.
I have to admit.
I usually dread the whole first-date thing.
You know, the awkward lulls in the conversation.
Then the anxious pain in the pit of my stomach when I can't wait... for the night to end, but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.
Yeah, I'm feeling rather painless and "lull-less" myself.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
But, uh, I do want to be honest with you about something.
Oh, no.
Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.
See, I was so flattered with the way you asked me out in the elevator.
- I know.
Don't tell me.
You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married... but Stewart and I have been living together for years.
- Yeah.
- Stewart—
- Am I a moron or what?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- I can't help it.
I'm hopeless.
- You're not.
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.
All you need is some space... some fresh air and some perspective.
Fresh air, space and perspective in New York City.
Stick with me.
This is unbelievable.
Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah, it's one of the perks of the job.
I give Jimmy the doorman free rides... and he lets me come up here whenever I fancy.
I love this city.
Oh, me too.
You know, it's funny, 'cause sometimes, up here... everything is so tall and grand.
Even my biggest problems, you know... suddenly seem very wee.
Within seconds they just melt away like tiny dewdrops.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.
Ah, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist.
I've been wanting to do that... from the moment I saw your face in my rearview mirror.
What's wrong?
Oh, Christ.
Was it awful?
I
- I'm a wee bit out of practice.
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.
Well, thank you.
Your lips seem... nice and supple too.
But I'm sensing that, uh—
Your heart's not doing the Riverdance thing that mine is.
Gordy, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- For what?
For being me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.
I happen to think you're pretty dandy.
So you're gay.
Big deal.
- How did you know?
- Just a feeling, I suppose.
That and the fact that you haven't shut up about Charlie all night.
And every time you mentioned her name you got that little... sparkle thing in your eyes.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.
That's easy.
You're gonna move on with your life... start being the person that you're supposed to be... instead of wasting your time pretending to be someone that you're not.
I mean, crikey.
Are you not exhausted?
I am, but it's so much easier to keep pretending.
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!
Isn't it?
As your newfound friend...
I am prescribing a remedy for you.
That's part of the remedy.
This is the remedy.
"I am woman.
Hear me roar."
Helen Reddy.
She'll sort you out.
Thereareafew things I'd like to know about you too.
All right.
What would you like to know?
Oh, just about anything.
Things you like.
Things you don't like.
Where you went to school.
Who was your first beau.
What you want out oflife.
- Mmm.
That's a tall order.
Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.
- Till the Clouds Roll By.
- I guess I like what everyone likes.
That's one of my favorite all-time movies.
I know every line and every step.
Me too.
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thank you.
No.
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.
Will you dance with me?
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.
- Do you know this dance?
- Yeah.
What's goin' on?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.
Sorry.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?
She must be ovulating.
I heard that.
Huh?
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?
Mmm.
She's the best.
Strong, independent, feisty.
- Who are you talking about?
- Who else?
Queen Oprah.
Oprah.
Oprah the Great.
Oprah— I love her.
Do you understand that I'm obsessed with her?
Like, I think she is so great that she should start her own religion.
I love her so much that if she and Steadman... couldn't have children and needed a little bit of help...
I would surrogate a child for them.
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.
Wow.
That's a lot of love.
Last night I was so inspired after watching her show about loving your body that—
- Do you know what I did today?
- What?
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!
Yeah!
Can you believe it?
I quit.
Fergie, "smergie."
I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.
And if Dereck isn't going to love me for the tiny amount... of cellulite I have on the back of my thighs...
- then fuck him— Screw that guy.
- Yeah.
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Hot!
- Thank you.
I mean, why does our society push us... to be perpetually uncomfortable with who we are?
It's so messed up.
You wanna know why?
Here.
This is why.
"Boost your buttocks in five days."
"Luscious liposuction." "The flawless face-lift."
That's why.
Enough is enough.
We need to stop letting society and-and media... and our religious leaders delegate who we are.
You're amazing, and I'm even more amazing... and anybody who doesn't get it can go screw themselves!
That felt fantastic.
Spewing is a wonderful thing.
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.
That's what they should have.
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.
What are you doing here?
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.
This better be good.
I'm about to get prepped for surgery.
What is it?
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.
Maybe you should just get prepped for surgery—
Maybe you should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.
Gray.
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.
It's really major, and I don't know how to say it.
- Why don't you take three short breaths and one—
- One long.
- I'm gay.
- What?
- As in Marvin.
- What?
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray," and— Bingo!
Oh.
- That's great.
- What about it is great?
- It's great that you're coming out.
- Don't tell me you knew.
Gray, of course I knew.
How can you know when I didn't even know?
I'm smarter than you.
I've known since second grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?
Tell you, I'm proud of you, Gray.
- This is a big moment.
This is huge.
- It's big, all right... but there's one other thing I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.
Bigger.
Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.
- Well, I guess it depends on how you see it.
- What is it?
- I'm in love with her.
- Who?
- Her.
- Who her?
- Your wife.
- Whose wife?
Yours.
I'm in love with Charlie.
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would never joke about it.
I love the way she talked and walked and looked and felt... but it really kicked in after we kissed.
Kissed?
What do you mean, kissed?
Are you saying you kissed my wife?
Only once, and technically she wasn't your wife.
It was the night before your wedding.
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.
Just tell me off.
Just yell at me.
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
Gray, I want you to pack up your shit and get it out of the apartment... by the time I get home tonight, because we're done.
All right?
We're done.
There has to be a reason.
Why would she move out without talking to us about it... or even telling us where she was going?
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?
It's not supposed to mean anything.
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.
Aren't you happy we'll have the place to ourselves?
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?
Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- What aren't you telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird.
You love your sister.
Yes, I love my sister.
How about you?
Do you love my sister?
Of course I love your sister.
I think she's great.
"Great." How great?
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You know what?
I'm late.
I gotta go, okay?
I'll see you later.
Sam?
So as you can see, the consumers love to think of nothing but C-Pro.
- B-Pro.
- What?
- B-Pro.
You said "C-Pro."
- I did?
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass of water.
Take your time.
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.
Gray, hang in there.
You're doing just fine.
- No, I'm not doing fine.
I'm the Titanic.
- No!
- Yes.
- You just gotta—You gotta get focused.
You gotta center yourself, and you gotta march back in there... and you show them who's the boss.
Who's the Boss?
I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light had really weird hair, but—
Gray!
You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?
You gotta get out of your head and get into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Center yourself.
- And go.
- Go.
Go.
Gimme a "P."Gimme an "R."
Gimme an "O."
What's that spell?
B
- Pro!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Lana, what the hell are you doing?
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative executive on the Bartlett account... because I thought it would be best to show Julia two perspectives.
- You mean the one of her tits and the one of her ass?
- Gray!
I'm sure that Lana has 36 double-D ideas... for the account, and I'll just give you your privacy to fondle through them.
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.
I'm sure it cost me my job.
Well, with copy like that, they should be begging you to stay.
Here.
Drink that while it's still hot.
That, young lady, is my granny's secret recipe.
Mmm!
This is so good.
What's in this?
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey and a wee bit of nutmeg.
Gordy, you are amazing.
You barely know me and you're such a great friend.
You're gonna make some lucky girl very happy one day.
So are you.
God, everything is so complicated.
If it was 30 years ago, I could just move away and join a convent.
Those outfits are so hideous.
You know, if you want my advice— and I don't suppose you do, but I'm going to give it to you anyway.
- I think you have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?
You have to tell her the truth.
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I mean, for all you know, she might feel the same way about you.
Come on.
Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.
But you won't know that until you talk to her.
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?
What if you go through your entire life saying, "What if?"
What happens if she does feel the same way?
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.
- He doesn't talk to you now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.
And do you foresee that ever changing?
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm.
Just drink your tea.
This is so good.
Are you sure this is just tea, nutmeg and honey?
Wee bit of whiskey.
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!
What kind of shortbread is this?
Mmm, short.
God,they'reso beautiful and magical and peaceful.
Will they have babies here?
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality among mammals.
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales... but did you know that over 50% of elephants are gay?
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People... over loudspeakers and watch their feet.
I'm kidding.
So where've you been hiding?
I've left three messages and no answer, and Sam won't say a word.
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.
Anything you want to talk about?
Do you remember that night we spent together in Las Vegas before you got married to Sam?
Barely.
I mean, I remember having a great time... but I think you got me too drunk to remember anything else.
Why?
Did I say something really stupid?
- It's not what you said.
- God.
What did I do?
I don't know if you did anything.
It might have just been me.
- Oh, my God.
I remember.
- You do?
- Yes.
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.
How could you let your brother marry me?
I didn't know if you were conscious of what was going on.
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?
I sounded like a cat in heat, didn't I?
Is that what you think we're talking about?
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?
- No.
That was it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.
Did you try to convince Sam not to marry me?
There was no convincing him.
Trust me.
If I could have, I would have.
You know, every morning I wake up before Sam does... and I just watch him.
I just lie there and stare.
And I love the way his nose wrinkles when he's dreaming... and the little purring sound that he makes when he's about to wake up.
And the way that he keeps his hand on my thigh the whole night... just to let me know that he's there.
And I know it may seem crazy... but love is crazy, isn't it?
It sure is.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?
You're so lucky.
I never had a brother or sister.
Oh!
I don't know what's going on between the two of you... but you have to work it out, Sam.
Just talk to her.
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah.
Gray.
Seems Julia wasn't thrilled with the way our last presentation went.
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated or patronized anymore.
- Actually, I was gonna give you a promotion, but—
- What?
I asked Jordan to make you the executive creative director on my account... and to give you free rein to do whatever you want.
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea was yours.
I think you have great ideas.
You just haven't been given the freedom to explore them fully.
I like your energy, your spunk, your candidness... and I think with the right support... you're gonna give me exactly what I'm looking for.
Wow!
- I don't know what to say.
- Sorry to interrupt, Gray... but your 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics is in the small conference room.
Oh, I don't have a 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics.
They said they confirmed it with your office.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.
Isn't she adorable?
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't have you in my book.
Hey.
See, you forgot your toothbrush... and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard, part soft bristles... must be hard to come by.
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?
And to say I'm sorry.
I overreacted— Little bit.
Not a lot.
Little bit.
After all, you have to admit... it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...
I'm not quite sure why I got so surprised... 'cause if you think about it... it's almost inevitable that you and I would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?
You're acting— You're acting very rational.
It's too rational.
You used to do this when we were kids.
Then I'd turn around and you'd tackle me.
I should be getting my knees in the lock-down position.
You know, Gray—
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.
You know that, right?
Being without you I feel like one half of me is missing.
Lately I've been feeling very lopsided.
- Oh, Sam.
- Just 'cause you're totally gay... and in love with my wife doesn't mean we can't work things out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.
Now, this is good.
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!
- Oh, my—
- Gray!
Gray!
Gray!
How ya doin'?
How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.
Put your eyes back in your heads.
Hey, what—
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.
- I never wanna see another human being ever again.
- No.
Look.
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad—
Who cares what those people think?
I care.
They're probably calling Jerry Springer right now as we speak.
No.
No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For having to be related to me.
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel—
Gray, look.
You're just— You're just coming out, okay?
- I am never coming out of this elevator.
- This is probably... the biggest revelation of your entire life.
It's normal to be going nuts.
- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.
I don't feel any of those things.
Well, how do you feel?
- Lonely.
- Why?
Because I'm never gonna be able to walk down the street... holding hands with my partner... without the rest of the world giving us a look.
I may never have the wedding that I once dreamed of... and I may never have children... and one day, when I die... people will never give as much respect to my grieving lover... as if she were my husband.
Gray... it's not as if you made a choice.
That's what terrifies me.
It's so much easier to be someone else.
Do you remember when we were kids— you would have been about six— and Dad came home to tell Mom he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.
Yeah.
Remember we stayed in the closet all night... just cuddled up like two little mice and... listened to their whole fight.
I was... so angry.
I was... hurt.
I was just—
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there and kick his ass...
- and you remember what you said to me?
- Hmm.
You were just six... but you said it was gonna be okay... that Dad was not gonna live a lie... that he was gonna try and be happy... and that everyone deserved to be happy.
I said that?
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.
Why are you being so nice to me?
- You should hate me.
- For what?
For having good taste?
You never have to worry about it.
I mean, she's completely, madly, passionately... like cow-jump-over-the-moon in love with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great... for me.
Not so great for you.
But you're not gonna make me feel guilty for this are you?
Mm-mmm.
Gray, you know what?
You can't expect the first girl that you fall in love with... to love you back.
That's—That's not how it works.
That would be the equivalent of settling down when you were age 12.
You haven't gone through gay puberty yet.
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?
- No.
Of the elevator.
- Of the elevator.
I should have broken up with Dereck ages ago.
I am having the best time.
- So what about you?
Have you met anyone yet?
- Not yet.
Really?
Giris should be lining up around the block for you.
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?
It depends, I guess.
- Funny.
You need funny.
- Funny would be good.
- And stylish.
No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.
And for the love of God, don't wind up... with one of those ladies who doesn't believe in waxing.
- You're killing me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
- Have you ever been attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
- Not even a little?
- No.
- Huh.
Oh.
Not even last year, when I was in shape after taking those Pilates classes?
Or last week when I wore that pink Marc Jacobs dress to work... and you told me how cute I looked?
You looked so cute.
You are cute, but, you know, not cute that way, cute.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's so depressing.
It's not like I'm into girls, but if I was a girl who was into girls...
I'd definitely be into me, 'cause I think I'm a catch.
You are a catch, but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.
Hmm.
But you said you don't have a type.
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.
Wait.
Don't you usually have therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?
Oh, my God.
I'm so late.
Shoot.
Okay.
You know, I don't really want to go, so watch this.
Sydney, it's Gray.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't wanna go to the batting cages... and I don't wanna go rock climbing or bowling or anywhere with you... 'cause I'm feeling really good about myself... and I don't think you're a very good therapist for me, so you're fired.
Thank you, and have a nice day.
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?
That was amazing.
Do you want to get a mani-pedi before we go back to work?
- Sure.
I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.
What if I dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?
- Yes.
- Really?
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!
I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?
Because you're gay, and you have to start behaving' like it.
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?
No, but you haven't had sex with a woman yet... and, you know, that's like being black... and never having listened to the Jackson Five... or being Jewish and never having a knish... or being Indian and never having had a curry or being—
Or being Scottish and not keeping your mouth shut?
- I suppose so.
Come on.
- Hi.
Sorry.
No men allowed.
Wh— Isn't that against the law?
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.
- No exceptions.
No men.
- Forget it.
Well, just go in by yourself.
I can't go in by myself.
Are you kidding?
I have an idea.
I would like an Apricot Sour, please.
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.
And a touch of lemon and a squeeze of lime.
And a little bit of sugar on the rim.
Comin' up.
Apricot Sour?
I thought that was what you women drank, for Christ's sakes.
- One of your eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.
Hi.
Can I buy you a drink?
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.
See, but thanks.
You don't?
Shut up.
This is quite tasty, actually.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.
Hey, give it a minute.
Oh, my God.
It's Julia Bartlett.
- Quick, quick.
I gotta get out of here.
- Why?
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello.
Is there anybody in?
No.
Her?
You think?
Gray, did your mom ever tell you... what your I.Q. Scores were?
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.
I'm just taking a break from working on your account.
Gray, I didn't come over here to check up on you.
Um, hello.
Uh, my name's Georgette.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
And, uh, lovely.
And I'm just gonna leave you two to, uh— to, uh— to catch up on everything.
- Mmm.
Lovely.
- Don't go.
Yeah, it was lovely to see you too.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Dutch way—Three kisses.
So, uh—
Fine.
It's fine.
I'm fine.
You're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, and I've got to go now.
Bye.
You really surprised me the other day.
I had no idea you were gay.
That makes two of us.
You're not just coming out, are you?
Put it this way.
My hotel's been closed for a long time... but tonight's the grand opening.
There have been a few fake openings... but tonight's the real deal.
I— No, I don't understand.
Yes, I'm just coming out.
I don't think anyone in here will mind.
You really are adorable.
I always thought so.
Really?
From day one, in that little cream, pin-striped suit you were wearing.
I like that suit too.
I think I got it at, uh, Banana Republic.
Or maybe it was, uh, Emporio Armani.
Actually, it could have been Barneys, but the shirt was from Bloomies.
Listen.
I have this beautiful bottle of cognac... that I just brought back from France, and I would—
- I'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?
No.
My place.
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.
Uh, okay, well—
I like cognac.
I like cognac.
I like brandy too.
Usually I have a little cognac with a splash of brandy on the side.
I have brandy too.
- Give it up.
You're toast.
- You're gonna eat those words.
Come on, Gray!
Come on!

- What are you doing?
Come back.
- No.
- Come on.
Turn around.

- Hey, hey!
##[Continues]
##[Continues]
- [Applauding] - ##[Continues]
You're the best.
You're amazing.
[Chattering]
##[Continues]
What do you say?
Beers on me.
Cold beers on me.
- Let's go!
- ##[Continues]
Wonderful.
Weren't they wonderful?
##[Continues]
Come on.
Keep it going, Gray.
##[Ends]
- [Man] Hey.
- Help!
- Okay.
- Help.
Ohh.
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?
- Yeah.
Mmm.
- What do you got?
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.
- And chicken.
- Good.
- And fish.
- And fish.
- And tofu.
- Good.
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great.
We got tempeh.
Then I got the regular essentials, like asparagus and lettuce.
- [Phone Rings]
- I got it.
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay?
Let's—
Hello?
Hey, Carrie.
Who?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, honey.
- Dinner?
No.
We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.
- We go out.
I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.
Do you want something fruity or full-bodied and do—
Okay.
Okay.
What— Californian, French, Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span—
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have to yell.
[Chattering]
- [Man] Ohh!
- Oh, my God.
That is amazing.
Oh, my God.
Carrie.
Do you believe this?
Ta-da!
[Chattering]
I would like to say something.
To Carrie and Dereck and their lovely friends.
[Speaking Spanish]
[Woman] Oh, my goodness.
I don't know what it means, but it sounded beautiful.
- It's a fake accent.
He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?
- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.
And poofs are rarely beefy.
I wrote a piece about that in a magazine once.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Carrie, do you have the new Liza Minnelli CD?
- Mmm.
Okay, and scratch my last comment.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.
- Oh, uh, more for you, yeah?
- Yes.
- Red or white?
- I'll have red.
Actually, I'll have white.
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.
- All right.
- Um, well, Julia Bartlett is not an easygoing client.
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.
Oh, honey.
- Doesn't mean you're getting a promotion before me.
- [Chuckles]
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what do you do?
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital... with a specialty in, uh— [Imitates Heartbeat] heart transplants.
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.
And how long have you two been together?
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thirty years.
- [Laughing]
- I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- No.
- Gray's my sister.
Oh, my God!
No!
Ick!
No, I'm—
I just— I thought that you two were an item.
Well, I just—
- What?
These-These two?
- Well, yeah.
You seem so—
So?
I don't know.
So together, I guess.
Hey, what'd I miss?
- Um, she thinks we're together.
- [Gray] Like "together"together?
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!
You're not the first one to think that, Elaine.
- Let me tell you.
- What?
- They're very codependent.
- [Together] We are not!
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart.
But if that's—
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.
How about that— Remember?
You want to know something?
I've even seen them share the same toothbrush.
- [Together] One time.
- Oh, ick.
- One time is— it's creepy.
- L— Listen.
I think that your relationship is charming.
- Thank you.
- Have you ever French-kissed?
[Laughing] That's beautiful.
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?
You know, the sisters that were 103 and 105, and they never got married... and they just did yoga and headstands together every day.
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.
- I'm serious.
We need to venture out.
- To where?
When?
I'm too busy to date, and I'm not goin' to bars.
The girls there, all they do is they talk about how fat they are.
They're not fat.
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.
You know what I want?
I want a girl who's not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay... and have no guilt attached, that's what I want.
Can't you meet a cute intern at the hospital?
[Imitates Buzzer] Wrong.
Can't do it.
Too dangerous.
You can't have sexual tension and cut an artery.
It's awkward.
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl for you, and you look for a guy for me...
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers is one of the Spice Girls.
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.
[Groans]
Somebody who doesn't think Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.
Someone who would call me an hour after our first date and say...
"I am crazy about you, and I'm counting the minutes until I could see you again."
[Sighs]
[With Scots Accent] That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.
Eatin' with your fingers, things.
It's quite festive.
[Laughing]
Hey, Jimmy.
Happy birthday!
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry about that.
Hey, Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
My Weight Watchers meeting went over, and it was too good to leave.
Why do you still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.
He has nerve.
He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know.
Right?
But trust me.
The entertainment factor alone is worth it.
Today, it was so crazy.
There was this woman who was all mad at her husband for not letting her have dessert.
So she breaks into the Soho Chocolate Factory... and tried to drown herself in a vat of chocolate.
- No.
- Yes.
- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka?
- Exactly.
It's like the cuckoo show.
Ooh, let's see who's in Page Six today.
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes... with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds like a crossing guard wrote it.
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.
- It's so cool and kitsch.
Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana?
Don't listen to Lana.
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?
I do think she does a lot more than just type for him.
- Give it up.
- Okay.
You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.
- Yeah.
- Lana—Wait, I feel like somebody's listening—
Lana goes to Kemiko, my pedicurist... and told her, who then told Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!
I know it's accurate gossip 'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me to do some research for him, so—
Oh, really?
Oh, that's too bad.
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Bye.
[Whispering] Research my ass.
You mean her ass.
[Snickers]
## [Synthesized]

[Woman's Voice] B-Pro.

- The campaign—
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.
- [Beeps]
- It's on, sir.
Carry on, Gray.
The campaign exudes nostalgia, comedy... thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion all under one banner.
It'll appeal to a wide demographic and leads the consumer... with an emotional end benefit of feeling charged up.
To challenge themselves and seize the day and be the best they can be.
Whoo!
- [Mouthing Words]
- Well, Julia?
And I must say you look fantastic.
What do you think?
Great, no?
No.
- N-N-No?
- No.
Well, it's, uh—it's just an initial proposal.
I mean, it still needs to be tweaked and tuned.
You only tweak or tune if something has potential.
Uh, we'll, uh—we'll go back to the drawing board then, that's all.
Why don't you call me when you have something original to present?
Julia, I'm sure we have a bunch of— Shut that thing off.
I'm sure we have a bunch of things.
This is just one of them.
What's wrong with you?
That was crap.
J-Julia, just a second.
I don't know, Sydney.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
How come every road I take turns out to be a dead end?
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.
At least with a fork there's a choice— right or left or east or west...
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you think you always reach these dead ends?
Ooh!
You see, gutter ball.
That's my life— a bunch of gutter balls.
Well, this is a perfect example... of why having therapy in different locations is so important.
Look at the deep symbolism in that gutter ball.
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.
Can you think of one word that best describes...
- the way your work situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?
- No, one.
- Um—
Ohh!
Frustrated.
- You're up.
- Right.
Okay, another word... for how you really feel when your brother wins all your races.
- Frustrated.
- Okay.
Another word for how you feel when you think about going on a date.
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.
I know.
But I can't help it.
It's a weird thing, but I see myself as this charming hotel... that's beautifully romantic and... wonderful on the outside... but on the inside, it just needs a ton of renovations.
Hence, closed for repairs.
Nice analogy.
What kinds of renovations?
Getting a promotion at work, perfecting the tango... disowning my mother, getting liposuction under my chin.
There's nothing worse than chin fat.
Uh, I think you need to... let the idea of sharing your life with someone other than your brother... enter your consciousness.
But how can I be conscious of something that I'm unconscious of?
It's not like I don't date.
I've had plenty of boyfriends.
Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.
Let's try something.
How about keeping the hotel closed... but keeping the veranda open for cocktails?
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front—
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out of time today... but we will resume this conversation next week at the rock climbing wall.
Nice game.
And what happened to going to a movie?
How are you going to meet anyone in a dark movie theater?
How are you going to meet anyone at a dog park?
Hello?
The dog park is a vortex for singles.
Hello?
When did we become dog owners?
- [Barking]
- No.
[Panting]
I wash my hand of this whole fiasco.
You're on your own.
Ow!
Grabbing.
- Check out center field.
- What about cen—Ahh!
Ohh!
Yes!
Holy... smokes.
I'll do the preinterview.
If she's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"
- And you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball."
- What?
- There's no way she's single.
- Do what I say.
- You know what?
Don't get bossy.
- Ow!
Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt.
Spazzy men are not attractive.
Some spazzy men are attractive.
- Gosh.
You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.
- Or should I say 21?
- She's legal.
Yeah.
I suppose I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?
Maybe a liver martini with a beefjerky twist?
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.
Originally Charlotte, but it always seemed too long and never quite suited me, so—
I'm Gray.
You can't really shorten that or it'd be "Gra."
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.
- Dancing?
Are you athletic?
- Uh—
- Do you watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well—
Do you have a boyfriend?
What is your favorite dessert?
[Chuckles] Okay.
Um, uh—
Let's see.
I'm a 1940s movie buff.
I love to swing dance.
I've never been very good at sports... um, love the Discovery Channel, "nix-ay" on the boyfriend... and, well, it's kind of a toss-up.
I-I like cheesecake, but I kind of love... those big, gooey hot fudge sundaes, so—
[Laughing] Get the ball.
[Gray Chuckling]
[Chuckles]
Who's that?
Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute.
What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- Suki.
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.
Oh, well, you are so adorable.
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.
He's one— He's one-five.
He's 15.
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.
Sam.
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people... that illegally keeps endangered animals in their apartment, like that guy... that got caught with a leopard in his kitchen?
No.
I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at New York Aquarium.
- Ha!
That's a relief.
- Free Willy is my favorite movie.
Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.
And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.
Orca.
Orca not so much.
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.
I'm staying on a friend's sofa for right now.
I just moved here from San Francisco about three weeks ago.
- I love San Francisco.
- Really?
Have you spent much time there?
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.
I know I've never been to San Francisco, but I know I would love it.
Tony Bennett loves it.
He left his heart there.
I love Tony Bennett.
There you go.
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?
Yeah.
You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons, 'cause we love that dog.
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny.
Gypsy's not mine either.
I dog walk on the side for extra cash.
I should probably get her back, so—
Oh.
It was really nice to meet you both.
- Nice meeting you both—You.
- Nice meeting you.
- What are you waiting for?
- What?
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.
All right.
Uh, excuse me!
Since you're new in town, if you're not doing anything tonight, maybe you'djoin us?
We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine, if you'd like tojoin us.
I just said that.
Would you like to join us?
Three times.
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Okay.

Cover me!
I'm goin' in.
Okay, best food movie.
- Like Water For Chocolate.
- Babette's Feast.
How about Babette's Feast?
- Okay.
- Okay, Fatso starring Dom DeLuise.
- Yes.
- Oh, good one.
Okay, is it me?
Let's see.
Uh, women you need to get away from.
Bette Davis in What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?
Ah, good one.
I got Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction for the rabbit.
- Kathy Bates in Misery.
- Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout, um, best screen kiss?
- Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.
- That's overrated, I think.
I'll go with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Notorious.
Okay.
I'll see your Notorious... and I'll raise you Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.
- Very good.
- Oh, wait.
I'll see your Doctor Zhivago... and I will raise you Lady and the Tramp in Lady and the Tramp.
Winner.
Winner.
The spaghetti pooch smooch.
Nothing better.
Thank God we're home.
My toes are even starting to swell.
I'm exhausted.
Dogs are barking?
No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.
I'm wide awake.
I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.
- Oh, yeah?
Me too.
You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.
Let's go to Soho House or Sway or like a diner or something.
- [Foot Stomps]
- Ow.
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?
Big meeting in the morning you have to get to?
Oh, that big meeting.
Actually, I'm pretty tired.
I should go to bed.
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay.
Good night.
I hope we can do this again.
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.
Night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got in late last night.
I didn't even hear you come in.
- I'm just getting in now.
- Sounds like you had a good time.
- It was more than good.
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.
Don't blow it.
You're off to a strong start, but a girl can sense a "glommer."
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes.
Glommer.
- I know.
I— Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy—
- I know she doesn't—
- She could think you're a glommer and you don't know.
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.
What?
And she said yes.
[Chuckles] Can you believe it?
We got our blood work done this morning, and we're going to Vegas this weekend...
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?
I know.
It's amazing.
It's like— It's-It's-It's— It's incredible.
You know what she is?
She's— She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.
She's the jackpot.
She's it.
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.
You know what she isn't?
An ax murderer.
You know what she is?
Perfect.
She's perfect.
Gray, remember what Mom always used to say?
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me.
It's right.
Mom is divorced for the third time, and she lives in a commune.
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."
I'm notjealous of you when you're totally psychologically unstable.
I'm psychologically unstable?
I'm psyc— You're the one that said "Get the ball."
I said "Get the ball," not "Get the ring."
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend, and we are gonna get married.
You can come with us.
I booked you a room.
I booked you a flight.
If you come, great.
And if you don't, that's your deal.
- But you know what?
I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?
One minute you know someone, the next minute they're so desperate...
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.
She doesn't have a lot of friends in the city, and I thought it'd be fun for you two.
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.
If you want sexy, I got sexy.
I mean, I know you kids aren't Little Bo Peep underneath those dresses.
- [Slurping]
- But... if you ask me... a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.
A beautiful bride, yes.
A glowing bride, of course.
But sexy is— I—
I just don't know.
Personally, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
Really?
Do you have anything in red with a slit up to the hip?
- Red!
- She's kidding.
Just something with a little less piff and poof and no lace.
Oh, no lace?
No problem.
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin... that is to die for.
Great.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Did you know that Sam cheats at Monopoly and he snores?
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I work with animals.
Hairy is a turn-on.
Honestly?
I was a goner the moment I saw him at the dog park.
There's just something about his impish smile and that twinkle in his eye.
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out of this thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.
Set them free.
Please tell me you don't wear stuff like that every day.
What?
Lingerie?
I love it.
I've spent more on lingerie than I have on rent.
I haven't bought a new pair of underwear in over four years.
- [Slurping] - [Chuckles]
- Eww.
That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don't you try a dress on?
- No.
- Come on.
This one's only 10,000.
No way, no way.
Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.
Come on.
It will be fun.
Try it on.
Forget about it.
No way.
Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.
No!
What if I damage it?
Shh.
Stay still while I get this zipper up.
[Gasps]
Ohh!
Did you cover me?
I was at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?
Yep.
But I told him you were at the gynecologist getting a pap smear.
It shut him up.
- Good one.
- So what were you doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.
- No!
- Sorry.
I've been reading too many trashy magazines.
What?
He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
- No.
- Yes!
The wedding is this weekend.
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.
The worst thing is, I can't think of a reason why he shouldn't marry her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
She's amazing.
Oh, please!
She's a gold-digging wench trying to hook her little claws into a resident surgeon... before he makes the big bucks that she can later get her hands on... in an ugly, ugly, ugly divorce settlement... that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping on the side, will handle.
You're not still taping All My Children every day?
I TiVo it.
But seriously, you must be flipping out that Sam is getting married... leaving you all alone, completely single... with no real prospects in the future?
That's horrible.
I feel so bad for you.
Promise me if I ever call you when I'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.
Sure.
Here you go.
Can I get some change?
Kidding.
Don't spend it all on the slots.
Red 21.
This place is—This is awesome.
[Chuckles]
Check this out.
This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?
It's a satin-cotton blend.
Possibly Egyptian cotton if this is the high-roller room.
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.
'Cause you're not doin' any high rollin' in this bed till tomorrow.
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.
You're not supposed to see the bride until tomorrow morning.
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall that you booked for me.
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.
Besides, we haven't been apart in six whole days.
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.
What are you guys— What are you guys gonna do without me?
- None of your business.
See you at the chapel.
- Ow!
Violent.
You're gonna get socked.
Ow!
Ow!
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.
- Ninja claw!
Ohh!
- Hey!
[Laughs]
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane.
We have to take a bath.
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.
- Exactly.
- Right.
I'll order two bottles.
Ta-da!
[Laughs] I hope you didn't greet the room service guy like that.
Hmm.
Is that why he said he didn't need a tip?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Please tell me you work out three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hate you.
If I told you I had acne until I was 21, would that make you feel better?
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.
My nickname was "Connect the Dots."
[Both Laughing]
I have a toast.
To my soon-to-be sister-in-law and my newfound friend—
That's a bathing suit you're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, are you?
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good since I was 17.
I'm not taking off a thing.
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know if I should.
- You should.
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.
Though I did get kicked out of the Brownies for stealing money out of my cookie account.
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.
Relations as in intercourse.
I decided to wait, and I don't know if that was a mistake.
I mean, what if he's too big or if I'm too small or—
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you to test drive a car before you buy it?
[Laughs]
[Cheering, Applause]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Well...
I love Vegas, and I am certain that Vegas loves me... because I lost a bundle on the slots last night.
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know.
I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.
For my next number, I'd like to give a warm welcome to my surprise guest— the delightful and charming Miss Charlie Kelsey.
Yeah!
- You didn't.
- Did.
- You didn't!
- Did.
- Why?
- Ooh!
Come on, honey.
How are you feeling this evening, Charlie?
Like I could throw up at any minute.
Well, that doesn't sound too pleasant.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean because of you.
I— Can I just sit down, please?
Not too fast.
Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble... to hear you sing a number with me tonight.
#Twelve # There, I sang a number.
I'm going home.
- Come on, girlfriend.
I think we can do this.
- ##[Piano:
Intro]
We can do this.
We can do this.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
## [Singing Disco]
## [Singing Along]
- Whoo!
- ##[Continues]
[Gray] I can't believe I lost that much money.
Don't tell Sam.
- He liked you too.
- Why did that—
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.
Ah.
My wedding shoes.
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.
- Can't.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
I'll help you.
- Mmm!
Sleeping.
[Sighs]
Oh.
Here.
Here's a shirt.
Do you think the woman was mad... when I asked to see her husband's tattoo on his tush?
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.
I still don't know if it was a ship or a— a bunny.
Did I tell you how happy I am you're gonna be my sister-in-law?
- About 17 times.
- Well, I mean it.
[Moaning]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
[Spitting]
I can't believe that just happened.
How can this be happening?
You're marrying my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.
[Exhales] Oh, this can't be happening.
This is just a mistake.
A meaningless, too-much-tequila mistake.
Oh, my God!
[Buzzing]
- [Stops] - [Groans]
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.
You're already dressed?
[Groans]
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?
Don't you think we should talk?
Okay.
Can we talk while I get ready?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I guess.
- Great.
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.
- Are you really upset?
- Yeah.
I would be too if it were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.
I know it was one of those crazy, spontaneous moments... but don't you feel weird at all?
Not really.
I mean, I know it may seem strange...
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural.
I feel subnatural.
- [Gargling]
- In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.
But if I phone home, Sam would answer, and that wouldn't be good.
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?
Gray, come on.
Sit down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Anyone would tell you the exact same thing.
It is 100% normal to be feeling upset, sad, freaked out.
In fact, considering everything...
I think you're handling the whole thing really well.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Your brother is getting married... and deep down inside you feel like you're losing him.
That's why you think I'm freaking out?
You think I'm having separation anxiety?
##[Organ]
## [Singing Gospel]
There's only one thing that can keep a marriage together... and that is love.
##[Choir Singing]
Oh.
As the lucky messenger of our Lord and Savior above...
I look to the two of you with your bright smiles of devotion... and promise of commitment here in the very house of the Lord above!
##[Resumes]
- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask... if there's anybody here who has any objection whatsoever... to the union of these two lovebirds.
[Hiccups]
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Go ahead.
As I was saying... if there's anybody here who has an objection to the union... of these two love angels, speak their piece now.
[Hiccups]
Oh, my God!
Look out!
[Screams]
Your hiccups gone?
- Actually, yes.
- Good.
Great.
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.
- Right?
- Right.
Then by the power vested in me by the glorious state of Nevada...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.
##[Gospel]
##[Man Singing Pop]
Hi.
I'd like a hot dog with kraut on one side and relish on the other... with ketchup on the kraut and mustard on the relish, but don't let the two touch.
##[Continues]
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency.
Call me.
##[Continues]
- ##[Fades] - [Sydney] Now reach to your right.
Station your left leg on the rock in the middle.
All right, Gray, what's really going on?
I canceled a session with someone today because you said it was an emergency.
- It is.
- Well, then?
Take a deep breath— [Inhales]
- [Exhales]
- And tell me what's going on.
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine.
Then do that.
- [Whispering] I think I'm gay.
- What was that?
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?
It's like this.
For years, I thought I was content being single... and I wasn't really interested in a relationship.
I thought that when Mr. Right came into my life, he just would.
He— He wouldn't need some fancy invitation.
He wouldjust arrive.
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right I'm waiting for.
It's Mrs. Right.
- Oh.
- And I think I found her.
And I kissed her— [Sighs]
And I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
But I know that I liked it.
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.
Why do you think you feel nauseous?
Do you think you committed some terrible sin just because you kissed a girl?
Why?
If you're two consenting adults, what's so terrible about that?
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.
Oh, so you believe you forced her to kiss you?
No.
No, not at all.
She kissed me.
- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.
Y-You don't know what it's like.
One day you think you're one thing... and the next day you realize you're something else.
I feel like I'm Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
I'm in this new land and I want to get home... but something is telling me maybe this is my home.
Maybe I shouldn't click my heels three times.
Maybe I should just stay here and be nauseous with the Munchkins.
What scares you most about this whole thing?
That I'll lose Sam and he'll never talk to me again.
Well, why would Sam even care?
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset I kissed his wife.
- Whoa!
- [Gasps]
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God.
Y-You're looking pale.
Maybe you should take some deep breaths.
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a wreck.
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque, begging for forgiveness.
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.
I think we need to talk about this on level ground.
You're not thinking straight.
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?
No.
What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.
You were so jealous of Charlie... that you subconsciously tried to sabotage Sam's marriage.
Read my lips.
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...
- and my heart's telling me—
- Actually, our time is up for today.
Now, forget about Sam and get out there and date.
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?
Now, I will see you next week at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
Nice climb.
[Exhales]
My hotel is open.
I have suites, junior suites, deluxe accommodations available.
- Hey. [Chuckles]
- Hey.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
You know, actually, my grandfather once told me it's much nicer to say...
"That outfit looks very becoming on you."
- Well, thanks to you and your pops.
- [Laughs]
Whoa.
That coffee smells great.
I'm on this no-caffeine kick right now... but I still find myself hanging around Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.
[Chuckles] Actually, it's not all coffee.
It's one-third coffee, one-third cocoa, one-third chai... with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.
- Wow.
That's a new one. [Chuckles] - [Chuckles]
[Inaudible]
- What was that?
- Mmm— Nothing.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
- Wow.
That—That took guts.
- [Laughs]
Would you?
Sure.
What time?
- Um, Raoul's at 10:00.
- All right.
Well, I'll see you then.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Great.
Are you going up?
- Down.
- Okay.
See you tonight.
- Oh!
- Are-Are you okay?
- [Chuckles] - [Indistinct]
- Is anything sprained?
Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
[Sighs]
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, you know, I'm a pretty busy guy.
I'm usually booked up every night.
I'd have to— I'd have to check my schedule.
- Yeah!
Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.
- [Sighs]
- Cool.
[Bell Dings]
[Sam] Hey, Gray.
Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?
Oh, you did some serious— Oh!
Damage.
Holy smokes.
Look at you.
What's the occasion?
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?
Yeah.
I got a 8:00 dinner with one, and I got a 10:00 dinner with the other.
That's great.
Did you get that rash you always get before you go out?
- No.
Why did you remind me?
- Just trying to help.
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?
I wanted to check in, see when you thought you might get your own place.
I know we get along great, and Charlie loves you... but we are newlyweds so I thought you might— [Clucks Tongue]
Do you know how hard it is to find a rent-controlled place in the city?
Why do I have to be the one to move?
One, the lease is in my name, and, two, I found the apartment.
'Cause a 90-year-old woman died on your shift at the hospital.
Her body wasn't even cold before you were calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.
I didn't hear you complaining.
As a matter of fact, you went to her funeral.
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean like you.
You can't kick me out.
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.
I'm just saying maybe you should start looking, that's all.
- I hate you!
I really do.
- Hey, hey!
Hey!
I can hear you guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?
- I wasn't yelling.
She was yelling.
- I was.
I hate him!
- Why?
What did he do now?
- Me?
- That's a little presumptuous, don't you think?
- He's kicking me out.
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.
We'll get our own place once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.
- Until then, it's fine.
I actually kind oflike it.
- You do?
Yeah.
It's fun.
I love living with the both of you.
- What's wrong?
- Shit.
[Chuckles]
She has a couple of dates tonight...
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.
Hey.
I think— I don't know if you remember me...
- but I think you drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida... and when you refer to Ginger's companion... you're not talking about sushi or wasabi.
- Not bad.
- [Chuckles]
- Where's that funny accent of yours from?
- Oh... a funny place called Scotland.
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.
- Hmm.
How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.
I've had two auditions so far.
The first one was for the lead in a tampon spot— the role of the tampon, of course— and then, uh, the second one was a voice-over... for a pest-control infomercial.
And I didn't get that part.
They, uh—They said that they thought roaches didn't have accents.
I begged to differ, but I didn't want to seem argumentative.
Hmm.
- [Sniffing]
- Don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say?
I am a mess.
You don't look like a mess.
You look as cute as a button.
And buttons aren't messy.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
You know, back home in Scotland, I was captain of the local football team.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
And all my mates used to come to me with their problems.
They said I was pretty good.
So—
I'm all ears if you want to talk to someone from the outside, you know?
Hmm.
That's sweet, but it would take all night to tackle my laundry list.
Thanks.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.
And I'm counting the minutes until I see you again.
- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.
We get paid to steal other people's lines.
See ya.
Uh, seriously, though—
Could I give you a lift home tonight?
I could come and fetch you about, say, just before midnight.
No charge.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.
With three olives and a tiny splash of vermouth.
- Okay.
- And just a hint— a hint— of salt on the rim.
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Tonight we have a braised lamb shank... marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.
That's served with a creamed pumpkin squash.
We also have a grilled halibut steak... in a soy-tamari lemon-zest glaze.
And that comes with grilled seaweed and an orange and almond salad.
Do we know what we'd like?
Yes.
I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin squash and the rosemary-lime sauce... and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.
Excellent.
Coming right up.
Conrad, I'm impressed.
You duked the guy.
I didn't know you had it in you.
There's a lot in me that you don't know about.
I'm a burnin'sex machine just waitin'to be used and abused by you.
The harder, the better.
- [Barks]
- Check, please.
...as much as I can, but it's not good.
- [Gray] How?
- I don't know.
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.
So you love Capra... you run in the park, you tango... you live for Italy, and you hate asparagus.
Are you sure we weren't separated at birth?
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies... every Thursday since I was 15.
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.
Closed hand, deuces wild.
I love it when you talk dirty.
This is actually fun.
I have to admit.
I usually dread the whole first-date thing.
You know, the awkward lulls in the conversation.
Then the anxious pain in the pit of my stomach when I can't wait... for the night to end, but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.
Yeah, I'm feeling rather painless and "lull-less" myself.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
But, uh, I do want to be honest with you about something.
Oh, no.
Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.
[Chuckles]
See, I was so flattered with the way you asked me out in the elevator.
- I know.
Don't tell me.
You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married... but Stewart and I have been living together for years.
- Yeah.
- Stewart—
- Am I a moron or what?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- I can't help it.
I'm hopeless.
- You're not.
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.
All you need is some space... some fresh air and some perspective.
Fresh air, space and perspective in New York City.
Stick with me.
[Gray] This is unbelievable.
[Cabdriver] Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah, it's one of the perks of the job.
I give Jimmy the doorman free rides... and he lets me come up here whenever I fancy.
[Inhales] I love this city.
- Oh, me too.
- [Laughs]
You know, it's funny, 'cause sometimes, up here... everything is so tall and grand.
Even my biggest problems, you know... suddenly seem very wee.
Within seconds they just melt away like tiny dewdrops.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.
Ah, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist.
[Exhales] I've been wanting to do that... from the moment I saw your face in my rearview mirror.
What's wrong?
Oh, Christ.
Was it awful?
I-I'm a wee bit out of practice.
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.
- Well, thank you.
- [Laughs]
Your lips seem... nice and supple too.
But I'm sensing that, uh—
[Exhales]
Your heart's not doing the Riverdance thing that mine is.
Gordy, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- For what?
For being me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.
I happen to think you're pretty dandy.
So you're gay.
Big deal.
- How did you know?
- Just a feeling, I suppose.
That and the fact that you haven't shut up about Charlie all night.
And every time you mentioned her name you got that little... sparkle thing in your eyes.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.
That's easy.
You're gonna move on with your life... start being the person that you're supposed to be... instead of wasting your time pretending to be someone that you're not.
I mean, crikey.
Are you not exhausted?
I am, but it's so much easier to keep pretending.
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!
Isn't it?
[Laughs]
As your newfound friend...
I am prescribing a remedy for you.
That's part of the remedy.
This is the remedy.
"I am woman.
Hear me roar."
Helen Reddy.
She'll sort you out.
[Laughs]
[Laughs]
[Man On TV] There are a few things I'd like to know about you too.
[Woman On TV] All right.
What would you like to know?
[Man] Oh, just about anything.
Things you like.
Things you don't like.
Where you went to school.
Who was your first beau.
What you want out oflife.
- Mmm.
That's a tall order.
Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.
- Till the Clouds Roll By.
- I guess I like what everyone likes.
That's one of my favorite all-time movies.
I know every line and every step.
Me too.
## [Big Band]
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thank you.
No.
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.
Will you dance with me?
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.
- Do you know this dance?
- Yeah.
##[Big Band]
##[Continues]
##[Continues]
- [Door Opens]
- What's goin' on?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.
Sorry.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?
- ##[Continues]
- She must be ovulating.
I heard that.
Huh?
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?
[Both Chuckling]
Mmm.
She's the best.
Strong, independent, feisty.
- Who are you talking about?
- Who else?
Queen Oprah.
Oprah.
Oprah the Great.
Oprah— I love her.
Do you understand that I'm obsessed with her?
Like, I think she is so great that she should start her own religion.
I love her so much that if she and Steadman... couldn't have children and needed a little bit of help...
I would surrogate a child for them.
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.
Wow.
That's a lot of love.
Last night I was so inspired after watching her show about loving your body that—
- Do you know what I did today?
- What?
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!
Yeah!
Can you believe it?
I quit.
Fergie, "smergie."
I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.
And if Dereck isn't going to love me for the tiny amount... of cellulite I have on the back of my thighs...
- then fuck him— Screw that guy.
- Yeah.
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Hot!
- Thank you.
I mean, why does our society push us... to be perpetually uncomfortable with who we are?
It's so messed up.
You wanna know why?
Here.
This is why.
"Boost your buttocks in five days."
"Luscious liposuction." "The flawless face-lift."
That's why.
Enough is enough.
We need to stop letting society and-and media... and our religious leaders delegate who we are.
You're amazing, and I'm even more amazing... and anybody who doesn't get it can go screw themselves!
[Moans]
[Sighs] That felt fantastic.
Spewing is a wonderful thing.
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.
That's what they should have.
[Moans]
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.
What are you doing here?
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.
This better be good.
I'm about to get prepped for surgery.
What is it?
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.
Maybe you should just get prepped for surgery—
Maybe you should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.
Gray.
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.
It's really major, and I don't know how to say it.
- Why don't you take three short breaths and one—
- One long.
[Puffing]
- I'm gay.
- What?
- As in Marvin.
- What?
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray," and— Bingo!
Oh.
- [Exhales] - [Exhales]
- That's great.
- What about it is great?
- It's great that you're coming out.
- Don't tell me you knew.
[Chuckling] Gray, of course I knew.
How can you know when I didn't even know?
I'm smarter than you.
I've known since second grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?
Tell you, I'm proud of you, Gray.
- This is a big moment.
This is huge.
- It's big, all right... but there's one other thing I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.
Bigger.
Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.
- Well, I guess it depends on how you see it.
- What is it?
- I'm in love with her.
- Who?
- Her.
- Who her?
- Your wife.
- Whose wife?
Yours.
I'm in love with Charlie.
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would never joke about it.
I love the way she talked and walked and looked and felt... but it really kicked in after we kissed.
Kissed?
What do you mean, kissed?
Are you saying you kissed my wife?
Only once, and technically she wasn't your wife.
It was the night before your wedding.
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.
Just tell me off.
Just yell at me.
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
Gray, I want you to pack up your shit and get it out of the apartment... by the time I get home tonight, because we're done.
All right?
We're done.
[Charlie] There has to be a reason.
Why would she move out without talking to us about it... or even telling us where she was going?
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?
It's not supposed to mean anything.
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.
Aren't you happy we'll have the place to ourselves?
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?
Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- What aren't you telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird.
You love your sister.
Yes, I love my sister.
How about you?
Do you love my sister?
Of course I love your sister.
I think she's great.
"Great." How great?
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You know what?
I'm late.
I gotta go, okay?
I'll see you later.
Sam?

So as you can see, the consumers love to think of nothing but C-Pro.
- B-Pro.
- What?
- B-Pro.
You said "C-Pro."
- I did?
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass of water.
Take your time.
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.
- [Groans]
- Gray, hang in there.
You're doing just fine.
- No, I'm not doing fine.
I'm the Titanic.
- No!
- Yes.
- You just gotta—You gotta get focused.
You gotta center yourself, and you gotta march back in there... and you show them who's the boss.
Who's the Boss?
I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light had really weird hair, but—
Gray!
You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?
You gotta get out of your head and get into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Center yourself.
[Exhales]
- And go.
- Go.
Go.
[Lana] Gimme a "P."Gimme an "R."
Gimme an "O."
What's that spell?
B
- Pro!
Yeah!
Whoo!
[Giggling]
Lana, what the hell are you doing?
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative executive on the Bartlett account... because I thought it would be best to show Julia two perspectives.
- You mean the one of her tits and the one of her ass?
- Gray!
I'm sure that Lana has 36 double-D ideas... for the account, and I'll just give you your privacy to fondle through them.
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.
I'm sure it cost me my job.
Well, with copy like that, they should be begging you to stay.
Here.
Drink that while it's still hot.
That, young lady, is my granny's secret recipe.
Mmm!
This is so good.
What's in this?
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey and a wee bit of nutmeg.
Gordy, you are amazing.
You barely know me and you're such a great friend.
You're gonna make some lucky girl very happy one day.
So are you.
God, everything is so complicated.
If it was 30 years ago, I could just move away and join a convent.
- Those outfits are so hideous.
- [Chuckles]
You know, if you want my advice— and I don't suppose you do, but I'm going to give it to you anyway.
- I think you have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?
You have to tell her the truth.
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I mean, for all you know, she might feel the same way about you.
Come on.
Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.
But you won't know that until you talk to her.
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?
What if you go through your entire life saying, "What if?"
What happens if she does feel the same way?
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.
- He doesn't talk to you now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.
And do you foresee that ever changing?
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm.
Just drink your tea.
This is so good.
Are you sure this is just tea, nutmeg and honey?
Wee bit of whiskey.
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!
What kind of shortbread is this?
- Mmm, short.
- [Chuckles]
[Gray] God, they're so beautiful and magical and peaceful.
Will they have babies here?
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality among mammals.
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales... but did you know that over 50% of elephants are gay?
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People... over loudspeakers and watch their feet.
- I'm kidding.
- [Laughs]
So where've you been hiding?
I've left three messages and no answer, and Sam won't say a word.
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.
Anything you want to talk about?
Do you remember that night we spent together in Las Vegas before you got married to Sam?
Barely.
I mean, I remember having a great time... but I think you got me too drunk to remember anything else.
Why?
Did I say something really stupid?
- It's not what you said.
- God.
What did I do?
I don't know if you did anything.
It might have just been me.
- Oh, my God.
I remember.
- You do?
- Yes.
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.
How could you let your brother marry me?
I didn't know if you were conscious of what was going on.
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?
I sounded like a cat in heat, didn't I?
Is that what you think we're talking about?
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?
- No.
That was it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.
Did you try to convince Sam not to marry me?
There was no convincing him.
Trust me.
If I could have, I would have.
You know, every morning I wake up before Sam does... and I just watch him.
I just lie there and stare.
And I love the way his nose wrinkles when he's dreaming... and the little purring sound that he makes when he's about to wake up.
And the way that he keeps his hand on my thigh the whole night... just to let me know that he's there.
And I know it may seem crazy... but love is crazy, isn't it?
[Laughing] It sure is.
##[Woman Singing Pop]
- [Door Opens] - ##[Continues]
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?
You're so lucky.
I never had a brother or sister.
Oh!
[Groans]
##[Continues]
I don't know what's going on between the two of you... but you have to work it out, Sam.
Just talk to her.
##[Continues]
##[Ends]
[Chuckling]
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah.
Gray.
Seems Julia wasn't thrilled with the way our last presentation went.
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated or patronized anymore.
- Actually, I was gonna give you a promotion, but—
- What?
I asked Jordan to make you the executive creative director on my account... and to give you free rein to do whatever you want.
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea was yours.
I think you have great ideas.
You just haven't been given the freedom to explore them fully.
I like your energy, your spunk, your candidness... and I think with the right support... you're gonna give me exactly what I'm looking for.
Wow!
- I don't know what to say.
- [Woman On Intercom] Sorry to interrupt, Gray... but your 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics is in the small conference room.
Oh, I don't have a 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics.
They said they confirmed it with your office.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.
Isn't she adorable?
[Chuckles]
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't have you in my book.
Hey.
See, you forgot your toothbrush... and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard, part soft bristles... must be hard to come by.
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?
And to say I'm sorry.
I overreacted— Little bit.
Not a lot.
Little bit.
After all, you have to admit... it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...
I'm not quite sure why I got so surprised... 'cause if you think about it... it's almost inevitable that you and I would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?
You're acting— You're acting very rational.
It's too rational.
You used to do this when we were kids.
Then I'd turn around and you'd tackle me.
I should be getting my knees in the lock-down position.
You know, Gray—
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.
You know that, right?
Being without you I feel like one half of me is missing.
Lately I've been feeling very lopsided.
- Oh, Sam.
- Just 'cause you're totally gay... and in love with my wife doesn't mean we can't work things out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.
Now, this is good.
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!
[Gray Squeals]
- [Gray Whimpering] Oh, my— - [Sam] Gray!
Gray!
Gray!
How ya doin'?
How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.
Put your eyes back in your heads.
[Whimpering]
[Bell Dings]
- Hey, what— - [Alarm Bell Ringing]
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.
- I never wanna see another human being ever again.
- No.
Look.
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad—
Who cares what those people think?
I care.
They're probably calling Jerry Springer right now as we speak.
No.
No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For having to be related to me.
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel— [Groans]
Gray, look.
You're just— You're just coming out, okay?
- I am never coming out of this elevator.
- This is probably... the biggest revelation of your entire life.
It's normal to be going nuts.
- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.
I don't feel any of those things.
Well, how do you feel?
- Lonely.
- Why?
Because I'm never gonna be able to walk down the street... holding hands with my partner... without the rest of the world giving us a look.
I may never have the wedding that I once dreamed of... and I may never have children... and one day, when I die... people will never give as much respect to my grieving lover... as if she were my husband.
Gray...
- it's not as if you made a choice.
- [Sobs]
That's what terrifies me.
It's so much easier to be someone else.
Do you remember when we were kids— you would have been about six— and Dad came home to tell Mom he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.
Yeah.
Remember we stayed in the closet all night... just cuddled up like two little mice and... listened to their whole fight.
I was... so angry.
I was... hurt.
I was just—
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there and kick his ass...
- and you remember what you said to me?
- Hmm.
You were just six... but you said it was gonna be okay... that Dad was not gonna live a lie... that he was gonna try and be happy... and that everyone deserved to be happy.
I said that?
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.
Why are you being so nice to me?
- You should hate me.
- For what?
For having good taste?
You never have to worry about it.
I mean, she's completely, madly, passionately... like cow-jump-over-the-moon in love with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great... for me.
Not so great for you.
But you're not gonna make me feel guilty for this are you?
Mm-mmm.
Gray, you know what?
You can't expect the first girl that you fall in love with... to love you back.
That's—That's not how it works.
That would be the equivalent of settling down when you were age 12.
You haven't gone through gay puberty yet.
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?
- No.
Of the elevator.
- Of the elevator.
[Carrie] I should have broken up with Dereck ages ago.
I am having the best time.
- So what about you?
Have you met anyone yet?
- Not yet.
Really?
Girls should be lining up around the block for you.
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?
It depends, I guess.
- Funny.
You need funny.
- Funny would be good.
- And stylish.
No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.
And for the love of God, don't wind up... with one of those ladies who doesn't believe in waxing.
- You're killing me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
- Have you ever been attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
- Not even a little?
- No.
- Huh.
Oh.
Not even last year, when I was in shape after taking those Pilates classes?
Or last week when I wore that pink Marc Jacobs dress to work... and you told me how cute I looked?
You looked so cute.
You are cute, but, you know, not cute that way, cute.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's so depressing.
It's not like I'm into girls, but if I was a girl who was into girls...
I'd definitely be into me, 'cause I think I'm a catch.
You are a catch, but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.
Hmm.
But you said you don't have a type.
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.
Wait.
Don't you usually have therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?
Oh, my God.
I'm so late.
Shoot.
Okay.
You know, I don't really want to go, so watch this.
[Beeping]
Sydney, it's Gray.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't wanna go to the batting cages... and I don't wanna go rock climbing or bowling or anywhere with you... 'cause I'm feeling really good about myself... and I don't think you're a very good therapist for me, so you're fired.
- Thank you, and have a nice day.
- [Laughs]
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?
That was amazing.
[Exhales] Do you want to get a mani-pedi before we go back to work?
- Sure.
I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.
What if I dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?
- Yes.
- Really?
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!
##[Woman Vocalizing]
##[Disco Beat]
##[Woman Vocalizing]
I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?
Because you're gay, and you have to start behaving' like it.
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?
No, but you haven't had sex with a woman yet... and, you know, that's like being black... and never having listened to the Jackson Five... or being Jewish and never having a knish... or being Indian and never having had a curry or being—
Or being Scottish and not keeping your mouth shut?
- I suppose so.
Come on.
- Hi.
Sorry.
No men allowed.
Wh— Isn't that against the law?
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.
- No exceptions.
No men.
- Forget it.
Well, just go in by yourself.
I can't go in by myself.
Are you kidding?
I have an idea.
[In Falsetto] I would like an Apricot Sour, please.
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.
And a touch of lemon and a squeeze of lime.
And a little bit of sugar on the rim.
Comin' up.
Apricot Sour?
I thought that was what you women drank, for Christ's sakes.
- One of your eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.
Hi.
Can I buy you a drink?
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.
See, but thanks.
You don't?
- Shut up.
- [Giggling]
This is quite tasty, actually.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.
Hey, give it a minute.
Oh, my God.
It's Julia Bartlett.
- Quick, quick.
I gotta get out of here.
- Why?
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello.
Is there anybody in?
No.
Her?
You think?
Gray, did your mom ever tell you... what your I.Q. Scores were?
[Chuckles]
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.
I'm just taking a break from working on your account.
Gray, I didn't come over here to check up on you.
[Both Laughing]
Um, hello.
Uh, my name's Georgette.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
And, uh, lovely.
And I'm just gonna leave you two to, uh— to, uh— to catch up on everything.
- Mmm.
Lovely.
- Don't go.
Yeah, it was lovely to see you too.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Dutch way—Three kisses.
So, uh—
Fine.
It's fine.
I'm fine.
You're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, and I've got to go now.
Bye.
You really surprised me the other day.
I had no idea you were gay.
[Exhales] That makes two of us.
You're not just coming out, are you?
Put it this way.
My hotel's been closed for a long time... but tonight's the grand opening.
There have been a few fake openings... but tonight's the real deal.
[Laughs] I— No, I don't understand.
[Whispering] Yes, I'm just coming out.
[Whispering] I don't think anyone in here will mind.
[Both Laughing]
You really are adorable.
I always thought so.
Really?
From day one, in that little cream, pin-striped suit you were wearing.
I like that suit too.
I think I got it at, uh, Banana Republic.
Or maybe it was, uh, Emporio Armani.
Actually, it could have been Barneys, but the shirt was from Bloomies.
Listen.
I have this beautiful bottle of cognac... that I just brought back from France, and I would—
- I'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?
No.
My place.
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.
Uh, okay, well—
[Exhales] I like cognac.
I like cognac.
I like brandy too.
Usually I have a little cognac with a splash of brandy on the side.
I have brandy too.

Hello?
Hey, Carrie.
Who?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, honey.
- Dinner?
No.
We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.
- We go out.
I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.
Do you want something fruity or full-bodied and do-
Okay.
Okay.
What
- Californian, French, Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span-
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have to yell.
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.
That is amazing.
Oh, my God.
Carrie.
Do you believe this?
Ta-da!
I would like to say something.
To Carrie and Dereck and their lovely friends.
Oh, my goodness.
I don't know what it means, but it sounded beautiful.
- It's a fake accent.
He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?
- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.
And poofs are rarely beefy.
I wrote a piece about that in a magazine once.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Carrie, do you have the new Liza Minnelli CD?
- Mmm.
Okay, and scratch my last comment.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.
- Oh, uh, more for you, yeah?
- Yes.
- Red or white?
- I'll have red.
Actually, I'll have white.
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.
- All right.
- Um, well, Julia Bartlett is not an easygoing client.
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.
Oh, honey.
- Doesn't mean you're getting a promotion before me.
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what do you do?
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital... with a specialty in, uh- heart transplants.
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.
And how long have you two been together?
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.
Thirty years.
- I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- No.
- Gray's my sister.
Oh, my God!
No!
Ick!
No, I'm-
I just
- I thought that you two were an item.
Well, I just-
- What?
These-These two?
- Well, yeah.
You seem so-
So?
I don't know.
So together, I guess.
Hey, what'd I miss?
- Um, she thinks we're together.
- Like "together"together?
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!
You're not the first one to think that, Elaine.
- Let me tell you.
- What?
- They're very codependent.
- We are not!
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart.
But if that's-
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.
How about that
- Remember?
You want to know something?
I've even seen them share the same toothbrush.
- One time.
- Oh, ick.
- One time is- it's creepy.
- L
- Listen.
I think that your relationship is charming.
- Thank you.
- Have you ever French-kissed?
That's beautiful.
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?
You know, the sisters that were 103 and 105, and they never got married... and they just did yoga and headstands together every day.
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.
- I'm serious.
We need to venture out.
- To where?
When?
I'm too busy to date, and I'm not goin' to bars.
The girls there, all they do is they talk about how fat they are.
They're not fat.
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.
You know what I want?
I want a girl who's not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay... and have no guilt attached, that's what I want.
Can't you meet a cute intern at the hospital?
Wrong.
Can't do it.
Too dangerous.
You can't have sexual tension and cut an artery.
It's awkward.
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl for you, and you look for a guy for me...
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers is one of the Spice Girls.
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.
Somebody who doesn't think Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.
Someone who would call me an hour after our first date and say...
"I am crazy about you, and I'm counting the minutes until I could see you again. "
That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.
Eatin' with your fingers, things.
It's quite festive.
Hey, Jimmy.
Happy birthday!
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry about that.
Hey, Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
My Weight Watchers meeting went over, and it was too good to leave.
Why do you still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.
He has nerve.
He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know.
Right?
But trust me.
The entertainment factor alone is worth it.
Today, it was so crazy.
There was this woman who was all mad at her husband for not letting her have dessert.
So she breaks into the Soho Chocolate Factory... and tried to drown herself in a vat of chocolate.
- No.
- Yes.
- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka?
- Exactly.
It's like the cuckoo show.
Ooh, let's see who's in Page Six today.
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes... with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds like a crossing guard wrote it.
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.
- It's so cool and kitsch.
Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana?
Don't listen to Lana.
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?
I do think she does a lot more than just type for him.
- Give it up.
- Okay.
You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.
- Yeah.
- Lana-Wait, I feel like somebody's listening-
Lana goes to Kemiko, my pedicurist... and told her, who then told Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!
I know it's accurate gossip 'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me to do some research for him, so-
Oh, really?
Oh, that's too bad.
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Research my ass.
You mean her ass.
B
- Pro.
The campaign-
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.
It's on, sir.
Carry on, Gray.
The campaign exudes nostalgia, comedy... thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion all under one banner.
It'll appeal to a wide demographic and leads the consumer... with an emotional end benefit of feeling charged up.
To challenge themselves and seize the day and be the best they can be.
Whoo!
Well, Julia?
And I must say you look fantastic.
What do you think?
Great, no?
No.
- N-N-No?
- No.
Well, it's, uh-it's just an initial proposal.
I mean, it still needs to be tweaked and tuned.
You only tweak or tune if something has potential.
Uh, we'll, uh-we'll go back to the drawing board then, that's all.
Why don't you call me when you have something original to present?
Julia, I'm sure we have a bunch of- Shut that thing off.
I'm sure we have a bunch of things.
This is just one of them.
What's wrong with you?
That was crap.
J
- Julia, just a second.
I don't know, Sydney.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
How come every road I take turns out to be a dead end?
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.
At least with a fork there's a choice- right or left or east or west...
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you think you always reach these dead ends?
Ooh!
You see, gutter ball.
That's my life- a bunch of gutter balls.
Well, this is a perfect example... of why having therapy in different locations is so important.
Look at the deep symbolism in that gutter ball.
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.
Can you think of one word that best describes...
- the way your work situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?
- No, one.
- Um-
Ohh!
Frustrated.
- You're up.
- Right.
Okay, another word... for how you really feel when your brother wins all your races.
- Frustrated.
- Okay.
Another word for how you feel when you think about going on a date.
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.
I know.
But I can't help it.
It's a weird thing, but I see myself as this charming hotel... that's beautifully romantic and... wonderful on the outside... but on the inside, it just needs a ton of renovations.
Hence, closed for repairs.
Nice analogy.
What kinds of renovations?
Getting a promotion at work, perfecting the tango... disowning my mother, getting liposuction under my chin.
There's nothing worse than chin fat.
Uh, I think you need to... let the idea of sharing your life with someone other than your brother... enter your consciousness.
But how can I be conscious of something that I'm unconscious of?
It's not like I don't date.
I've had plenty of boyfriends.
Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.
Let's try something.
How about keeping the hotel closed... but keeping the veranda open for cocktails?
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front-
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out of time today... but we will resume this conversation next week at the rock climbing wall.
Nice game.
And what happened to going to a movie?
How are you going to meet anyone in a dark movie theater?
How are you going to meet anyone at a dog park?
Hello?
The dog park is a vortex for singles.
Hello?
When did we become dog owners?
No.
I wash my hand of this whole fiasco.
You're on your own.
Ow!
Grabbing.
- Check out center field.
- What about cen-Ahh!
Ohh!
Yes!
Holy... smokes.
I'll do the preinterview.
If she's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"
- And you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball. "
- What?
- There's no way she's single.
- Do what I say.
- You know what?
Don't get bossy.
- Ow!
Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt.
Spazzy men are not attractive.
Some spazzy men are attractive.
- Gosh.
You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.
- Or should I say 21?
- She's legal.
Yeah.
I suppose I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?
Maybe a liver martini with a beefjerky twist?
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.
Originally Charlotte, but it always seemed too long and never quite suited me, so-
I'm Gray.
You can't really shorten that or it'd be "Gra. "
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.
- Dancing?
Are you athletic?
- Uh-
- Do you watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well-
Do you have a boyfriend?
What is your favorite dessert?
Okay.
Um, uh-
Let's see.
I'm a 1940s movie buff.
I love to swing dance.
I've never been very good at sports... um, love the Discovery Channel, "nix-ay" on the boyfriend... and, well, it's kind of a toss-up.
L
- I like cheesecake, but I kind of love... those big, gooey hot fudge sundaes, so-
Get the ball.
Who's that?
Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute.
What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- Suki.
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.
Oh, well, you are so adorable.
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.
He's one
- He's one-five.
He's 15.
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.
Sam.
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people... that illegally keeps endangered animals in their apartment, like that guy... that got caught with a leopard in his kitchen?
No.
I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at New York Aquarium.
- Ha!
That's a relief.
- Free Willy is my favorite movie.
Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.
And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.
Orca.
Orca not so much.
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.
I'm staying on a friend's sofa for right now.
I just moved here from San Francisco about three weeks ago.
- I love San Francisco.
- Really?
Have you spent much time there?
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.
I know I've never been to San Francisco, but I know I would love it.
Tony Bennett loves it.
He left his heart there.
I love Tony Bennett.
There you go.
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?
Yeah.
You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons, 'cause we love that dog.
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny.
Gypsy's not mine either.
I dog walk on the side for extra cash.
I should probably get her back, so-
Oh.
It was really nice to meet you both.
- Nice meeting you both-You.
- Nice meeting you.
- What are you waiting for?
- What?
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.
All right.
Uh, excuse me!
Since you're new in town, if you're not doing anything tonight, maybe you'djoin us?
We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine, if you'd like tojoin us.
I just said that.
Would you like to join us?
Three times.
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Okay.
Perfecto!
R
- R-R-ico.
R
- R-R-R-R.
R
- R-R-R-R-R-Rico.
Oh, easy, Pancho Villa.
These girls are conmigo.
More vino, por favor.
!
Ayayay, oh!
Gracias.
Gracias.
Carlos!
Cover me!
I'm goin' in.
Okay, best food movie.
- Like Water For Chocolate.
- Babette's Feast.
How about Babette's Feast?
- Okay.
- Okay, Fatso starring Dom DeLuise.
- Yes.
- Oh, good one.
Okay, is it me?
Let's see.
Uh, women you need to get away from.
Bette Davis in What Ever Happened To BabyJane?
Ah, good one.
I got Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction for the rabbit.
- Kathy Bates in Misery.
- Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout, um, best screen kiss?
- Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.
- That's overrated, I think.
I'll go with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Notorious.
Okay.
I'll see your Notorious... and I'll raise you Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.
- Very good.
- Oh, wait.
I'll see your Doctor Zhivago... and I will raise you Lady and the Tramp in Lady and the Tramp.
Winner.
Winner.
The spaghetti pooch smooch.
Nothing better.
Thank God we're home.
My toes are even starting to swell.
I'm exhausted.
Dogs are barking?
No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.
I'm wide awake.
I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.
- Oh, yeah?
Me too.
You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.
Let's go to Soho House or Sway or like a diner or something.
Ow.
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?
Big meeting in the morning you have to get to?
Oh, that big meeting.
Actually, I'm pretty tired.
I should go to bed.
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay.
Good night.
I hope we can do this again.
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.
Night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got in late last night.
I didn't even hear you come in.
- I'm just getting in now.
- Sounds like you had a good time.
- It was more than good.
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.
Don't blow it.
You're off to a strong start, but a girl can sense a "glommer. "
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes.
Glommer.
- I know.
L
- Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy-
- I know she doesn't-
- She could think you're a glommer and you don't know.
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.
What?
And she said yes.
Can you believe it?
We got our blood work done this morning, and we're going to Vegas this weekend...
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?
I know.
It's amazing.
It's like- It's-It's-It's
- It's incredible.
You know what she is?
She's
- She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.
She's the jackpot.
She's it.
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.
You know what she isn't?
An ax murderer.
You know what she is?
Perfect.
She's perfect.
Gray, remember what Mom always used to say?
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me.
It's right.
Mom is divorced for the third time, and she lives in a commune.
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."
I'm notjealous of you when you're totally psychologically unstable.
I'm psychologically unstable?
I'm psyc- You're the one that said "Get the ball. "
I said "Get the ball," not "Get the ring. "
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend, and we are gonna get married.
You can come with us.
I booked you a room.
I booked you a flight.
If you come, great.
And if you don't, that's your deal.
- But you know what?
I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?
One minute you know someone, the next minute they're so desperate...
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.
She doesn't have a lot of friends in the city, and I thought it'd be fun for you two.
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.
If you want sexy, I got sexy.
I mean, I know you kids aren't Little Bo Peep underneath those dresses.
But... if you ask me... a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.
A beautiful bride, yes.
A glowing bride, of course.
But sexy is
- I-
I just don't know.
Personally, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
Really?
Do you have anything in red with a slit up to the hip?
- Red!
- She's kidding.
Just something with a little less piff and poof and no lace.
Oh, no lace?
No problem.
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin... that is to die for.
Great.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Did you know that Sam cheats at Monopoly and he snores?
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I work with animals.
Hairy is a turn-on.
Honestly?
I was a goner the moment I saw him at the dog park.
There's just something about his impish smile and that twinkle in his eye.
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out of this thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.
Set them free.
Please tell me you don't wear stuff like that every day.
What?
Lingerie?
I love it.
I've spent more on lingerie than I have on rent.
I haven't bought a new pair of underwear in over four years.
- Eww.
That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don't you try a dress on?
- No.
- Come on.
This one's only 10,000.
No way, no way.
Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.
Come on.
It will be fun.
Try it on.
Forget about it.
No way.
Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.
No!
What if I damage it?
Shh.
Stay still while I get this zipper up.
Ohh!
Did you cover me?
I was at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?
Yep.
But I told him you were at the gynecologist getting a pap smear.
It shut him up.
- Good one.
- So what were you doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.
- No!
- Sorry.
I've been reading too many trashy magazines.
What?
He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
- No.
- Yes!
The wedding is this weekend.
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.
The worst thing is, I can't think of a reason why he shouldn't marry her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
She's amazing.
Oh, please!
She's a gold-digging wench trying to hook her little claws into a resident surgeon... before he makes the big bucks that she can later get her hands on... in an ugly, ugly, ugly divorce settlement... that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping on the side, will handle.
You're not still taping All My Children every day?
I TiVo it.
But seriously, you must be flipping out that Sam is getting married... leaving you all alone, completely single... with no real prospects in the future?
That's horrible.
I feel so bad for you.
Promise me if I ever call you when I'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.
Sure.
Here you go.
Can I get some change?
Kidding.
Don't spend it all on the slots.
Red 21.
This place is-This is awesome.
Check this out.
This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?
It's a satin-cotton blend.
Possibly Egyptian cotton if this is the high-roller room.
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.
'Cause you're not doin' any high rollin' in this bed till tomorrow.
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.
You're not supposed to see the bride until tomorrow morning.
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall that you booked for me.
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.
Besides, we haven't been apart in six whole days.
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.
What are you guys- What are you guys gonna do without me?
- None of your business.
See you at the chapel.
- Ow!
Violent.
You're gonna get socked.
Ow!
Ow!
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.
- Ninja claw!
Ohh!
- Hey!
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane.
We have to take a bath.
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.
- Exactly.
- Right.
I'll order two bottles.
Ta-da!
I hope you didn't greet the room service guy like that.
Hmm.
Is that why he said he didn't need a tip?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Please tell me you work out three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hate you.
If I told you I had acne until I was 21, would that make you feel better?
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.
My nickname was "Connect the Dots. "
I have a toast.
To my soon-to-be sister-in-law and my newfound friend-
That's a bathing suit you're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, are you?
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good since I was 17.
I'm not taking off a thing.
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know if I should.
- You should.
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.
Though I did get kicked out of the Brownies for stealing money out of my cookie account.
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.
Relations as in intercourse.
I decided to wait, and I don't know if that was a mistake.
I mean, what if he's too big or if I'm too small or-
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you to test drive a car before you buy it?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Well...
I love Vegas, and I am certain that Vegas loves me... because I lost a bundle on the slots last night.
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know.
I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.
For my next number, I'd like to give a warm welcome to my surprise guest- the delightful and charming Miss Charlie Kelsey.
Yeah!
- You didn't.
- Did.
- You didn't!
- Did.
- Why?
- Ooh!
Come on, honey.
How are you feeling this evening, Charlie?
Like I could throw up at any minute.
Well, that doesn't sound too pleasant.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean because of you.
L
- Can I just sit down, please?
Not too fast.
Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble... to hear you sing a number with me tonight.
#Twelve # There, I sang a number.
I'm going home.
Come on, girlfriend.
I think we can do this.
We can do this.
We can do this.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whoo!
I can't believe I lost that much money.
Don't tell Sam.
- He liked you too.
- Why did that-
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.
Ah.
My wedding shoes.
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.
- Can't.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
I'll help you.
- Mmm!
Sleeping.
Oh.
Here.
Here's a shirt.
Do you think the woman was mad... when I asked to see her husband's tattoo on his tush?
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.
I still don't know if it was a ship or a- a bunny.
Did I tell you how happy I am you're gonna be my sister-in-law?
- About 17 times.
- Well, I mean it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that just happened.
How can this be happening?
You're marrying my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.
Oh, this can't be happening.
This is just a mistake.
A meaningless, too-much-tequila mistake.
Oh, my God!
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.
You're already dressed?
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?
Don't you think we should talk?
Okay.
Can we talk while I get ready?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I guess.
- Great.
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.
- Are you really upset?
- Yeah.
I would be too if it were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.
I know it was one of those crazy, spontaneous moments... but don't you feel weird at all?
Not really.
I mean, I know it may seem strange...
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural.
I feel subnatural.
In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.
But if I phone home, Sam would answer, and that wouldn't be good.
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?
Gray, come on.
Sit down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Anyone would tell you the exact same thing.
It is 100% normal to be feeling upset, sad, freaked out.
In fact, considering everything...
I think you're handling the whole thing really well.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Your brother is getting married... and deep down inside you feel like you're losing him.
That's why you think I'm freaking out?
You think I'm having separation anxiety?
There's only one thing that can keep a marriage together... and that is love.
Oh.
As the lucky messenger of our Lord and Savior above...
I look to the two of you with your bright smiles of devotion... and promise of commitment here in the very house of the Lord above!
- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask... if there's anybody here who has any objection whatsoever... to the union of these two lovebirds.
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Go ahead.
As I was saying... if there's anybody here who has an objection to the union... of these two love angels, speak their piece now.
Oh, my God!
Look out!
Your hiccups gone?
- Actually, yes.
- Good.
Great.
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.
- Right?
- Right.
Then by the power vested in me by the glorious state of Nevada...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.
Hi.
I'd like a hot dog with kraut on one side and relish on the other... with ketchup on the kraut and mustard on the relish, but don't let the two touch.
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency.
Call me.
Now reach to your right.
Station your left leg on the rock in the middle.
All right, Gray, what's really going on?
I canceled a session with someone today because you said it was an emergency.
- It is.
- Well, then?
Take a deep breath-
And tell me what's going on.
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine.
Then do that.
- I think I'm gay.
- What was that?
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?
It's like this.
For years, I thought I was content being single... and I wasn't really interested in a relationship.
I thought that when Mr. Right came into my life, he just would.
He
- He wouldn't need some fancy invitation.
He wouldjust arrive.
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right I'm waiting for.
It's Mrs. Right.
- Oh.
- And I think I found her.
And I kissed her-
And I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
But I know that I liked it.
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.
Why do you think you feel nauseous?
Do you think you committed some terrible sin just because you kissed a girl?
Why?
If you're two consenting adults, what's so terrible about that?
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.
Oh, so you believe you forced her to kiss you?
No.
No, not at all.
She kissed me.
- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.
Y
- You don't know what it's like.
One day you think you're one thing... and the next day you realize you're something else.
I feel like I'm Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
I'm in this new land and I want to get home... but something is telling me maybe this is my home.
Maybe I shouldn't click my heels three times.
Maybe I should just stay here and be nauseous with the Munchkins.
What scares you most about this whole thing?
That I'll lose Sam and he'll never talk to me again.
Well, why would Sam even care?
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset I kissed his wife.
Whoa!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God.
Y
- You're looking pale.
Maybe you should take some deep breaths.
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a wreck.
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque, begging for forgiveness.
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.
I think we need to talk about this on level ground.
You're not thinking straight.
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?
No.
What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.
You were so jealous of Charlie... that you subconsciously tried to sabotage Sam's marriage.
Read my lips.
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...
- and my heart's telling me-
- Actually, our time is up for today.
Now, forget about Sam and get out there and date.
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?
Now, I will see you next week at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
Nice climb.
My hotel is open.
I have suites, junior suites, deluxe accommodations available.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
You know, actually, my grandfather once told me it's much nicer to say...
"That outfit looks very becoming on you. "
Well, thanks to you and your pops.
Whoa.
That coffee smells great.
I'm on this no-caffeine kick right now... but I still find myself hanging around Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.
Actually, it's not all coffee.
It's one-third coffee, one-third cocoa, one-third chai... with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.
Wow.
That's a new one.
- What was that?
- Mmm
- Nothing.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Wow.
That-That took guts.
Would you?
Sure.
What time?
- Um, Raoul's at 10:00.
- All right.
Well, I'll see you then.
Great.
Are you going up?
- Down.
- Okay.
See you tonight.
- Oh!
- Are-Are you okay?
- Is anything sprained?
Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, you know, I'm a pretty busy guy.
I'm usually booked up every night.
I'd have to- I'd have to check my schedule.
- Yeah!
Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.
Cool.
Hey, Gray.
Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?
Oh, you did some serious
- Oh!
Damage.
Holy smokes.
Look at you.
What's the occasion?
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?
Yeah.
I got a 8:00 dinner with one, and I got a 10:00 dinner with the other.
That's great.
Did you get that rash you always get before you go out?
- No.
Why did you remind me?
- Just trying to help.
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?
I wanted to check in, see when you thought you might get your own place.
I know we get along great, and Charlie loves you... but we are newlyweds so I thought you might-
Do you know how hard it is to find a rent-controlled place in the city?
Why do I have to be the one to move?
One, the lease is in my name, and, two, I found the apartment.
'Cause a 90-year-old woman died on your shift at the hospital.
Her body wasn't even cold before you were calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.
I didn't hear you complaining.
As a matter of fact, you went to her funeral.
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean like you.
You can't kick me out.
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.
I'm just saying maybe you should start looking, that's all.
- I hate you!
I really do.
- Hey, hey!
Hey!
I can hear you guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?
- I wasn't yelling.
She was yelling.
- I was.
I hate him!
- Why?
What did he do now?
- Me?
- That's a little presumptuous, don't you think?
- He's kicking me out.
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.
We'll get our own place once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.
- Until then, it's fine.
I actually kind oflike it.
- You do?
Yeah.
It's fun.
I love living with the both of you.
- What's wrong?
- Shit.
She has a couple of dates tonight...
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.
Hey.
I think- I don't know if you remember me...
- but I think you drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida... and when you refer to Ginger's companion... you're not talking about sushi or wasabi.
Not bad.
- Where's that funny accent of yours from?
- Oh... a funny place called Scotland.
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.
- Hmm.
How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.
I've had two auditions so far.
The first one was for the lead in a tampon spot- the role of the tampon, of course- and then, uh, the second one was a voice-over... for a pest-control infomercial.
And I didn't get that part.
They, uh-They said that they thought roaches didn't have accents.
I begged to differ, but I didn't want to seem argumentative.
Hmm.
Don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say?
I am a mess.
You don't look like a mess.
You look as cute as a button.
And buttons aren't messy.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
You know, back home in Scotland, I was captain of the local football team.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
And all my mates used to come to me with their problems.
They said I was pretty good.
So-
I'm all ears if you want to talk to someone from the outside, you know?
Hmm.
That's sweet, but it would take all night to tackle my laundry list.
Thanks.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.
And I'm counting the minutes until I see you again.
- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.
We get paid to steal other people's lines.
See ya.
Uh, seriously, though-
Could I give you a lift home tonight?
I could come and fetch you about, say, just before midnight.
No charge.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.
With three olives and a tiny splash of vermouth.
- Okay.
- And just a hint- a hint- of salt on the rim.
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?
- Please. - Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Tonight we have a braised lamb shank... marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.
That's served with a creamed pumpkin squash.
We also have a grilled halibut steak... in a soy-tamari lemon-zest glaze.
And that comes with grilled seaweed and an orange and almond salad.
Do we know what we'd like?
Yes.
I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin squash and the rosemary-lime sauce... and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.
Excellent.
Coming right up.
Conrad, I'm impressed.
You duked the guy.
I didn't know you had it in you.
There's a lot in me that you don't know about.
I'm a burnin'sex machine just waitin'to be used and abused by you.
The harder, the better.
Check, please.
...as much as I can, but it's not good.
- How?
- I don't know.
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.
So you love Capra... you run in the park, you tango... you live for Italy, and you hate asparagus.
Are you sure we weren't separated at birth?
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies... every Thursday since I was 15.
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.
Closed hand, deuces wild.
I love it when you talk dirty.
This is actually fun.
I have to admit.
I usually dread the whole first-date thing.
You know, the awkward lulls in the conversation.
Then the anxious pain in the pit of my stomach when I can't wait... for the night to end, but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.
Yeah, I'm feeling rather painless and "lull-less" myself.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
But, uh, I do want to be honest with you about something.
Oh, no.
Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.
See, I was so flattered with the way you asked me out in the elevator.
- I know.
Don't tell me.
You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married... but Stewart and I have been living together for years.
- Yeah.
- Stewart-
- Am I a moron or what?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- I can't help it.
I'm hopeless.
- You're not.
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.
All you need is some space... some fresh air and some perspective.
Fresh air, space and perspective in New York City.
Stick with me.
This is unbelievable.
Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah, it's one of the perks of the job.
I giveJimmy the doorman free rides... and he lets me come up here whenever I fancy.
I love this city.
Oh, me too.
You know, it's funny, 'cause sometimes, up here... everything is so tall and grand.
Even my biggest problems, you know... suddenly seem very wee.
Within seconds they just melt away like tiny dewdrops.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.
Ah, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist.
I've been wanting to do that... from the moment I saw your face in my rearview mirror.
What's wrong?
Oh, Christ.
Was it awful?
L
- I'm a wee bit out of practice.
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.
Well, thank you.
Your lips seem... nice and supple too.
But I'm sensing that, uh-
Your heart's not doing the Riverdance thing that mine is.
Gordy, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- For what?
For being me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.
I happen to think you're pretty dandy.
So you're gay.
Big deal.
- How did you know?
- Just a feeling, I suppose.
That and the fact that you haven't shut up about Charlie all night.
And every time you mentioned her name you got that little... sparkle thing in your eyes.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.
That's easy.
You're gonna move on with your life... start being the person that you're supposed to be... instead of wasting your time pretending to be someone that you're not.
I mean, crikey.
Are you not exhausted?
I am, but it's so much easier to keep pretending.
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!
Isn't it?
As your newfound friend...
I am prescribing a remedy for you.
That's part of the remedy.
This is the remedy.
"I am woman.
Hear me roar. "
Helen Reddy.
She'll sort you out.
There are a few things I'd like to know about you too.
All right.
What would you like to know?
Oh, just about anything.
Things you like.
Things you don't like.
Where you went to school.
Who was your first beau.
What you want out oflife.
- Mmm.
That's a tall order.
Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.
- Till the Clouds Roll By.
- I guess I like what everyone likes.
That's one of my favorite all-time movies.
I know every line and every step.
Me too.
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thank you.
No.
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.
Will you dance with me?
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.
- Do you know this dance?
- Yeah.
What's goin' on?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.
Sorry.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?
She must be ovulating.
I heard that.
Huh?
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?
Mmm.
She's the best.
Strong, independent, feisty.
- Who are you talking about?
- Who else?
Queen Oprah.
Oprah.
Oprah the Great.
Oprah
- I love her.
Do you understand that I'm obsessed with her?
Like, I think she is so great that she should start her own religion.
I love her so much that if she and Steadman... couldn't have children and needed a little bit of help...
I would surrogate a child for them.
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.
Wow.
That's a lot of love.
Last night I was so inspired after watching her show about loving your body that-
- Do you know what I did today?
- What?
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!
Yeah!
Can you believe it?
I quit.
Fergie, "smergie. "
I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.
And if Dereck isn't going to love me for the tiny amount... of cellulite I have on the back of my thighs...
- then fuck him
- Screw that guy.
- Yeah.
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Hot!
- Thank you.
I mean, why does our society push us... to be perpetually uncomfortable with who we are?
It's so messed up.
You wanna know why?
Here.
This is why.
"Boost your buttocks in five days. "
"Luscious liposuction. " "The flawless face-lift. "
That's why.
Enough is enough.
We need to stop letting society and-and media... and our religious leaders delegate who we are.
You're amazing, and I'm even more amazing... and anybody who doesn't get it can go screw themselves!
That felt fantastic.
Spewing is a wonderful thing.
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.
That's what they should have.
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.
What are you doing here?
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.
This better be good.
I'm about to get prepped for surgery.
What is it?
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.
Maybe you should just get prepped for surgery-
Maybe you should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.
Gray.
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.
It's really major, and I don't know how to say it.
- Why don't you take three short breaths and one-
- One long.
- I'm gay.
- What?
- As in Marvin.
- What?
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray," and
- Bingo!
Oh.
- That's great.
- What about it is great?
- It's great that you're coming out.
- Don't tell me you knew.
Gray, of course I knew.
How can you know when I didn't even know?
I'm smarter than you.
I've known since second grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?
Tell you, I'm proud of you, Gray.
- This is a big moment.
This is huge.
- It's big, all right... but there's one other thing I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.
Bigger.
Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.
- Well, I guess it depends on how you see it.
- What is it?
- I'm in love with her.
- Who?
- Her.
- Who her?
- Your wife.
- Whose wife?
Yours.
I'm in love with Charlie.
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would never joke about it.
I love the way she talked and walked and looked and felt... but it really kicked in after we kissed.
Kissed?
What do you mean, kissed?
Are you saying you kissed my wife?
Only once, and technically she wasn't your wife.
It was the night before your wedding.
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.
Just tell me off.
Just yell at me.
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
Gray, I want you to pack up your shit and get it out of the apartment... by the time I get home tonight, because we're done.
All right?
We're done.
There has to be a reason.
Why would she move out without talking to us about it... or even telling us where she was going?
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?
It's not supposed to mean anything.
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.
Aren't you happy we'll have the place to ourselves?
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?
Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- What aren't you telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird.
You love your sister.
Yes, I love my sister.
How about you?
Do you love my sister?
Of course I love your sister.
I think she's great.
"Great. " How great?
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You know what?
I'm late.
I gotta go, okay?
I'll see you later.
Sam?
So as you can see, the consumers love to think of nothing but C-Pro.
- B-Pro.
- What?
- B-Pro.
You said "C-Pro. "
- I did?
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass of water.
Take your time.
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.
Gray, hang in there.
You're doing just fine.
- No, I'm not doing fine.
I'm the Titanic.
- No!
- Yes.
- You just gotta-You gotta get focused.
You gotta center yourself, and you gotta march back in there... and you show them who's the boss.
Who's the Boss?
I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light had really weird hair, but-
Gray!
You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?
You gotta get out of your head and get into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Center yourself.
- And go.
- Go.
Go.
Gimme a "P."Gimme an "R."
Gimme an "O."
What's that spell?
B
- Pro!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Lana, what the hell are you doing?
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative executive on the Bartlett account... because I thought it would be best to show Julia two perspectives.
- You mean the one of her tits and the one of her ass?
- Gray!
I'm sure that Lana has 36 double-D ideas... for the account, and I'll just give you your privacy to fondle through them.
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.
I'm sure it cost me my job.
Well, with copy like that, they should be begging you to stay.
Here.
Drink that while it's still hot.
That, young lady, is my granny's secret recipe.
Mmm!
This is so good.
What's in this?
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey and a wee bit of nutmeg.
Gordy, you are amazing.
You barely know me and you're such a great friend.
You're gonna make some lucky girl very happy one day.
So are you.
God, everything is so complicated.
If it was 30 years ago, I could just move away and join a convent.
Those outfits are so hideous.
You know, if you want my advice- and I don't suppose you do, but I'm going to give it to you anyway.
- I think you have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?
You have to tell her the truth.
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I mean, for all you know, she might feel the same way about you.
Come on.
Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.
But you won't know that until you talk to her.
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?
What if you go through your entire life saying, "What if?"
What happens if she does feel the same way?
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.
- He doesn't talk to you now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.
And do you foresee that ever changing?
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm.
Just drink your tea.
This is so good.
Are you sure this is just tea, nutmeg and honey?
Wee bit of whiskey.
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!
What kind of shortbread is this?
Mmm, short.
God, they're so beautiful and magical and peaceful.
Will they have babies here?
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality among mammals.
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales... but did you know that over 50% of elephants are gay?
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People... over loudspeakers and watch their feet.
I'm kidding.
So where've you been hiding?
I've left three messages and no answer, and Sam won't say a word.
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.
Anything you want to talk about?
Do you remember that night we spent together in Las Vegas before you got married to Sam?
Barely.
I mean, I remember having a great time... but I think you got me too drunk to remember anything else.
Why?
Did I say something really stupid?
- It's not what you said.
- God.
What did I do?
I don't know if you did anything.
It might have just been me.
- Oh, my God.
I remember.
- You do?
- Yes.
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.
How could you let your brother marry me?
I didn't know if you were conscious of what was going on.
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?
I sounded like a cat in heat, didn't I?
Is that what you think we're talking about?
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?
- No.
That was it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.
Did you try to convince Sam not to marry me?
There was no convincing him.
Trust me.
If I could have, I would have.
You know, every morning I wake up before Sam does... and I just watch him.
I just lie there and stare.
And I love the way his nose wrinkles when he's dreaming... and the little purring sound that he makes when he's about to wake up.
And the way that he keeps his hand on my thigh the whole night... just to let me know that he's there.
And I know it may seem crazy... but love is crazy, isn't it?
It sure is.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?
You're so lucky.
I never had a brother or sister.
Oh!
I don't know what's going on between the two of you... but you have to work it out, Sam.
Just talk to her.
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah.
Gray.
Seems Julia wasn't thrilled with the way our last presentation went.
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated or patronized anymore.
- Actually, I was gonna give you a promotion, but-
- What?
I asked Jordan to make you the executive creative director on my account... and to give you free rein to do whatever you want.
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea was yours.
I think you have great ideas.
You just haven't been given the freedom to explore them fully.
I like your energy, your spunk, your candidness... and I think with the right support... you're gonna give me exactly what I'm looking for.
Wow!
- I don't know what to say.
- Sorry to interrupt, Gray... but your 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics is in the small conference room.
Oh, I don't have a 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics.
They said they confirmed it with your office.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.
Isn't she adorable?
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't have you in my book.
Hey.
See, you forgot your toothbrush... and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard, part soft bristles... must be hard to come by.
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?
And to say I'm sorry.
I overreacted- Little bit.
Not a lot.
Little bit.
After all, you have to admit... it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...
I'm not quite sure why I got so surprised... 'cause if you think about it... it's almost inevitable that you and I would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?
You're acting
- You're acting very rational.
It's too rational.
You used to do this when we were kids.
Then I'd turn around and you'd tackle me.
I should be getting my knees in the lock-down position.
You know, Gray-
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.
You know that, right?
Being without you I feel like one half of me is missing.
Lately I've been feeling very lopsided.
- Oh, Sam.
- Just 'cause you're totally gay... and in love with my wife doesn't mean we can't work things out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.
Now, this is good.
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!
- Oh, my-
- Gray!
Gray!
Gray!
How ya doin'?
How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.
Put your eyes back in your heads.
Hey, what-
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.
- I never wanna see another human being ever again.
- No.
Look.
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad-
Who cares what those people think?
I care.
They're probably calling Jerry Springer right now as we speak.
No.
No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For having to be related to me.
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel-
Gray, look.
You're just- You're just coming out, okay?
- I am never coming out of this elevator.
- This is probably... the biggest revelation of your entire life.
It's normal to be going nuts.
- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.
I don't feel any of those things.
Well, how do you feel?
- Lonely.
- Why?
Because I'm never gonna be able to walk down the street... holding hands with my partner... without the rest of the world giving us a look.
I may never have the wedding that I once dreamed of... and I may never have children... and one day, when I die... people will never give as much respect to my grieving lover... as if she were my husband.
Gray... it's not as if you made a choice.
That's what terrifies me.
It's so much easier to be someone else.
Do you remember when we were kids- you would have been about six- and Dad came home to tell Mom he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.
Yeah.
Remember we stayed in the closet all night... just cuddled up like two little mice and... listened to their whole fight.
I was... so angry.
I was... hurt.
I was just-
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there and kick his ass...
- and you remember what you said to me?
- Hmm.
You were just six... but you said it was gonna be okay... that Dad was not gonna live a lie... that he was gonna try and be happy... and that everyone deserved to be happy.
I said that?
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.
Why are you being so nice to me?
- You should hate me.
- For what?
For having good taste?
You never have to worry about it.
I mean, she's completely, madly, passionately... like cow-jump-over-the-moon in love with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great... for me.
Not so great for you.
But you're not gonna make me feel guilty for this are you?
Mm-mmm.
Gray, you know what?
You can't expect the first girl that you fall in love with... to love you back.
That's-That's not how it works.
That would be the equivalent of settling down when you were age 12.
You haven't gone through gay puberty yet.
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?
- No.
Of the elevator.
- Of the elevator.
I should have broken up with Dereck ages ago.
I am having the best time.
- So what about you?
Have you met anyone yet?
- Not yet.
Really?
Girls should be lining up around the block for you.
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?
It depends, I guess.
- Funny.
You need funny.
- Funny would be good.
- And stylish.
No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.
And for the love of God, don't wind up... with one of those ladies who doesn't believe in waxing.
- You're killing me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
- Have you ever been attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
- Not even a little?
- No.
- Huh.
Oh.
Not even last year, when I was in shape after taking those Pilates classes?
Or last week when I wore that pink MarcJacobs dress to work... and you told me how cute I looked?
You looked so cute.
You are cute, but, you know, not cute that way, cute.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's so depressing.
It's not like I'm into girls, but if I was a girl who was into girls...
I'd definitely be into me, 'cause I think I'm a catch.
You are a catch, but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.
Hmm.
But you said you don't have a type.
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.
Wait.
Don't you usually have therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?
Oh, my God.
I'm so late.
Shoot.
Okay.
You know, I don't really want to go, so watch this.
Sydney, it's Gray.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't wanna go to the batting cages... and I don't wanna go rock climbing or bowling or anywhere with you... 'cause I'm feeling really good about myself... and I don't think you're a very good therapist for me, so you're fired.
Thank you, and have a nice day.
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?
That was amazing.
Do you want to get a mani-pedi before we go back to work?
- Sure.
I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.
What if I dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?
- Yes.
- Really?
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!
I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?
Because you're gay, and you have to start behaving' like it.
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?
No, but you haven't had sex with a woman yet... and, you know, that's like being black... and never having listened to theJackson Five... or being Jewish and never having a knish... or being Indian and never having had a curry or being-
Or being Scottish and not keeping your mouth shut?
- I suppose so.
Come on.
- Hi.
Sorry.
No men allowed.
Wh
- Isn't that against the law?
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.
- No exceptions.
No men.
- Forget it.
Well, just go in by yourself.
I can't go in by myself.
Are you kidding?
I have an idea.
I would like an Apricot Sour, please.
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.
And a touch of lemon and a squeeze of lime.
And a little bit of sugar on the rim.
Comin' up.
Apricot Sour?
I thought that was what you women drank, for Christ's sakes.
- One of your eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.
Hi.
Can I buy you a drink?
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.
See, but thanks.
You don't?
Shut up.
This is quite tasty, actually.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.
Hey, give it a minute.
Oh, my God.
It's Julia Bartlett.
- Quick, quick.
I gotta get out of here.
- Why?
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello.
Is there anybody in?
No.
Her?
You think?
Gray, did your mom ever tell you... what your I.Q. Scores were?
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.
I'm just taking a break from working on your account.
Gray, I didn't come over here to check up on you.
Um, hello.
Uh, my name's Georgette.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
And, uh, lovely.
And I'm just gonna leave you two to, uh- to, uh- to catch up on everything.
- Mmm.
Lovely.
- Don't go.
Yeah, it was lovely to see you too.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Dutch way-Three kisses.
So, uh-
Fine.
It's fine.
I'm fine.
You're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, and I've got to go now.
Bye.
You really surprised me the other day.
I had no idea you were gay.
That makes two of us.
You're not just coming out, are you?
Put it this way.
My hotel's been closed for a long time... but tonight's the grand opening.
There have been a few fake openings... but tonight's the real deal.
L
- No, I don't understand.
Yes, I'm just coming out.
I don't think anyone in here will mind.
You really are adorable.
I always thought so.
Really?
From day one, in that little cream, pin-striped suit you were wearing.
I like that suit too.
I think I got it at, uh, Banana Republic.
Or maybe it was, uh, Emporio Armani.
Actually, it could have been Barneys, but the shirt was from Bloomies.
Listen.
I have this beautiful bottle of cognac... that I just brought back from France, and I would-
- I'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?
No.
My place.
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.
Uh, okay, well-
I like cognac.
I like cognac.
I like brandy too.
Usually I have a little cognac with a splash of brandy on the side.
I have brandy too.
- Give it up.
You're toast.
- You're gonna eat those words.
Come on, Gray!
Come on!
Subrip
- What are you doing?
Come back.
- No.
- Come on.
Turn around.
- Hey, hey!
.
You're the best.
You're amazing.
What do you say?
Beers on me.
Cold beers on me.
- Let's go!
.
Wonderful.
Weren't they wonderful?
Come on.
Keep it going, Gray.
- Hey.
- Help!
.
- Okay.
- Help.
Ohh.
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?
- Yeah.
Mmm.
- What do you got?
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.
- And chicken.
- Good.
- And fish.
- And fish.
- And tofu.
- Good.
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great.
We got tempeh.
Then I got the regular essentials, like asparagus and lettuce.
- I got it.
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay?
Let's-
Hello?
Hey, Carrie.
Who?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, honey.
- Dinner?
No.
We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.
- We go out.
I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.
Do you want something fruity or full-bodied and do-
Okay.
Okay.
What
- Californian, French, Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span-
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have toyell.
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.
That is amazing.
Oh, my God.
Carrie.
Doyou believe this?
Ta-da!
I would like to say something.
To Carrie and Dereck and their lovely friends.
[ Speaking Italian ]
Oh, my goodness.
I don't know what it means, but it sounded beautiful.
- It's a fake accent.
He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?
- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.
And poofs are rarely beefy.
I wrote a piece about that in a magazine once.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Carrie, do you have the new Liza Minnelli CD?
- Mmm.
Okay., and scratch my last comment.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.
- Oh, uh, more for you, yeah?
- Yes.
- Red orwhite?
- I'll have red.
Actually, I'll have white.
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.
- All right.
- Um, well,Julia Bartlett is not an easy going client.
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.
Oh, honey.
- Doesn't mean you're getting a promotion before me.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what doyou do?
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital... with a specialty in, uh- [ Imitates Heartbeat] heart transplants.
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.
And how long have you two been together?
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thirtyyears.
- [ Laughing ]
- I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- No.
- Gray's my sister.
Oh, my God!
No!
Ick!
No, I'm-
I just
- I thought thatyou two were an item.
Well, I just-
- What?
These-These two?
- Well, yeah.
You seem so-
So?
I don't know.
So together, I guess.
Hey, what'd I miss?
- Um, she thinks we're together.
- Like "together" together?
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!
You're not the first one to think that, Elaine.
- Let me tell you.
- What?
- They're very codependent.
- [ Together] We are not!
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart.
But ifthat's-
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.
How about that
- Remember?
You want to know something?
I've even seen them share the same toothbrush.
- [ Together] One time.
- Oh, ick.
- One time is- it's creepy.
- I
- Listen.
I think thatyour relationship is charming.
- Thankyou.
- Haveyou ever French-kissed?
[Laughing] That's beautiful.
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?
You know, the sisters that were 1 03 and 1 05, and they never got married... and theyjust did yoga and headstands together every day.
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.
- I'm serious.
We need to venture out.
- To where?
When?
I'm too busy to date, and I'm not goin' to bars.
The girls there, all they do is they talk about how fat they are.
They're not fat.
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.
You know what I want?
I want a girl who's not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay... and have no guilt attached, that's what I want.
Can'tyou meet a cute intern at the hospital?
[ Imitates Buzzer] Wrong.
Can't do it.
Too dangerous.
You can't have sexual tension and cut an artery.
It's awkward.
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl foryou, and you look for a guy for me...
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers is one ofthe Spice Girls.
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.
Somebodywho doesn't think Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.
Someone who would call me an hour after our first date and say...
"I am crazy aboutyou, and I'm counting the minutes until I could seeyou again."
[With Scots Accent ] That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.
Eatin' with your fingers, things.
It's quite festive.
[ Laughing ]
Hey,Jimmy.
Happy birthday!
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry about that.
Hey,Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
MyWeight Watchers meeting went over, and it was too good to leave.
Why doyou still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.
He has nerve.
He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know.
Right?
But trust me.
The entertainment factor alone is worth it.
Today, it was so crazy.
There was this woman who was all mad at her husband for not letting her have dessert.
So she breaks into the Soho Chocolate Factory... and tried to drown herself in a vat of chocolate.
- No.
- Yes.
- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy.
Wonka?
- Exactly.
It's like the cuckoo show.
Ooh, let's see who's in Page Six today.
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes... with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds like a crossing guard wrote it.
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.
- It's so cool and kitsch.
Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana?
Don't listen to Lana.
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?
I do think she does a lot more than just type for him.
- Give it up.
- Okay.
You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.
- Yeah.
- Lana-Wait, I feel like somebody's listening-
Lana goes to Kemiko, my pedicurist... and told her, who then told Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!
I know it's accurate gossip 'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me to do some research for him, so-
Oh, really.?
Oh, that's too bad.
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Bye.
[ Whispering ] Research my ass.
You mean her ass.
[ Snickers ]
[ Synthesized ]
[ Continues ]
[ Woman's Voice ] B-Pro.
- [ Ends ]
- The campaign-
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.
- [ Beeps ]
- It's on, sir.
Carry on, Gray.
The campaign exudes nostalgia, comedy... thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion all under one banner.
It'll appeal to a wide demographic and leads the consumer... with an emotional endbenefit offeeling charged up.
To challenge themselves and seize the day and be the best they can be.
Whoo!
- [ Mouthing Words ]
- Well,Julia?
And I must sayyou look fantastic.
What doyou think?
Great, no?
No.
- N-N-No?
- No.
Well, it's, uh-it's just an initialproposal.
I mean, it still needs to be tweaked and tuned.
You only tweak or tune if something has potential.
Uh, we'll, uh-we'll go back to the drawing board then, that's all.
Why don'tyou call mewhen you have something original to present?
Julia, I'm surewe have a bunch of- Shut that thing off.
I'm sure we have a bunch ofthings.
This isjust one ofthem.
What's wrong with you?
That was crap.
J-Julia, just a second.
I don't know, Sydney.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
How come every road I take turns out to be a dead end?
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.
At least with a fork there's a choice- right or left or east orwest...
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you thinkyou always reach these dead ends?
Ooh!
You see, gutter ball.
That's my life- a bunch of gutter balls.
Well, this is a perfect example... ofwhy having therapy in different locations is so important.
Look at the deep symbolism in that gutter ball.
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.
Can you think of one word that best describes...
- the wayyourwork situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?
- No, one.
- Um-
Ohh!
Frustrated.
- You're up.
- Right.
Okay, anotherword... for how you really feel when your brotherwins all your races.
- Frustrated.
- Okay.
Anotherword for how you feel when you think about going on a date.
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.
I know.
But I can't help it.
It's a weird thing, but I see myself as this charming hotel... that's beautifully romantic and... wonderful on the outside... but on the inside, it just needs a ton of renovations.
Hence, closed for repairs.
Nice analogy.
What kinds of renovations?
Getting a promotion at work, perfecting the tango... disowning my mother, getting liposuction under my chin.
There's nothing worse than chin fat.
Uh, I thinkyou need to...
let the idea ofsharing your life with someone other than your brother... enteryour consciousness.
But how can I be conscious of something that I'm unconscious of?
It's not like I don't date.
I've had plenty ofboyfriends.
Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.
Let's try something.
How about keeping the hotel closed... but keeping the veranda open for cocktails?
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front-
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out oftime today... but we will resume this conversation next week at the rock climbing wall.
Nice game.
And what happened to going to a movie?
How areyou going to meet anyone in a dark movie theater?
How areyou going to meet anyone at a dog park?
Hello?
The dog park is a vortex for singles.
Hello?
When did we become dog owners?
- [Barking]
- No.
[ Panting ]
I wash my hand ofthis whole fiasco.
You're on your own.
Ow!
Grabbing.
- Check out center field.
- What about cen-Ahh!
Ohh!
Yes!
Holy... smokes.
I'll do the preinterview.
Ifshe's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"
- and you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball."
- What?
- There's no way.she's single.
- Do what I say.
- You know what?
Don't get bossy.
- Ow!
Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt.
Spazzy men are not attractive.
Some spazzy men are attractive.
- Gosh.
You're so beautiful.
- Thankyou.
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.
- Or should I say 21?
- She's legal.
Yeah.
I suppose I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?
May.be a livermartini with a beefjerky.twist?
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.
Originally.
Charlotte, but it alway.s seemed too long and never quite suited me, so-
I 'm Gray.
You can't really shorten that or it'd be "Gra."
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meety.ou.
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.
- Dancing?
Are you athletic?
- Uh-
- Doyou watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well-
Doy.ou have a boyfrriend?
What isy.ourfavorite dessert?
[ Chuckles ] Okay.
Um, uh-
Let's see.
I'm a 1 940s movie buff.
I love to swing dance.
I've never been very good at sports... um, love the Discovery Channel, "nix-ay" on the boyfriend... and, well, it's kind ofa toss-up.
I-I like cheesecake, but I kind of love... those big, gooey hot fudge sundaes, so-
[ Laughing ] Get the ball.
[ Gray.
Chuckling]
[ Chuckles ]
Who's that?
Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute.
What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- Suki.
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.
Oh, well, you are so adorable.
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.
He's one
- He's one-five.
He's 15.
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.
Sam.
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people... that illegally keeps endangered animals in their apartment, like that guy... that got caught with a leopard in his kitchen?
No.
I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at NewYorkAquarium.
- Ha!
That's a relief.
- Free Willy. is my favorite movie.
Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.
And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.
Orca.
Orca not so much.
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.
I'm staying on a friend's sofa for right now.
I just moved here from San Francisco about three weeks ago.
- I love San Francisco.
- Really?
Have you spent much time there?
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.
I know I've never been to San Francisco, but I know I would love it.
Tony.Bennett loves it.
He left his heart there.
I love Tony.
Bennett.
There y.ou go.
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?
Yeah.
You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons, 'cause we love that dog.
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny.
Gypsy's not mine either.
I dog walk on the side for extra cash.
I should probably get her back, so-
Oh.
It was really nice to meetyou both.
- Nice meeting you both-You.
- Nice meeting you.
- What areyou waiting for?
- What?
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.
All right.
Uh, excuse me!
Sincey.ou're newin town, ify.ou're not doing anything tonight, may.bey.ou'djoin us?
We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine, ify.ou'd like to join us.

I'm wide awake.
I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.
- Oh, yeah?
Me too.
You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.

I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.

- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.
Don't blow it.
You're offto a strong start, but a girl can sense a "glommer."
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes.
Glommer.
- I know.
I
- Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy-
- I know she doesn't-
- She could thinkyou're a glommer and you don't know.
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.
What?
And she said yes.
[ Chuckles ] Cany.ou believe it?
We got ourblood work done this morning, and we're going to Vegas this weekend...
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?
I know.
I t's amazing.
It's like
- It's-It's-It's
- It's incredible.
You know what she is?
She's
- She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.
She's the jackpot.
She's it.
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.
You know what she isn't?
An ax murderer.
You know what she is?
Perfect.
She's perfect.
Gray., rememberwhat Mom alway.s used to say.?
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me.
It's right.
Mom is divorced for the third time, and she lives in a commune.
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."
I'm notjealous ofy.ou wheny.ou're totally.
psy.chologically. unstable.
I'm psychologically unstable?
I'm psyc- You're the one that said "Get the ball."
I said "Get the ball," not "Get the ring."
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend, and we are gonna get married.
You can come with us.
I bookedy.ou a room.
I bookedy.ou a ight.
Ifyou come, great.
And ifyou don't, that's your deal.
- But you know what?
I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?
One minute you know someone, the next minute they're so desperate...
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.
She doesn't have a lot offriends in the city, and I thought it'd be fun foryou two.
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.
Yeah, I thinkyou're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.
Ifyou want sexy, I got sexy.
I mean, I knowyou kids aren't Little Bo Peep underneath those dresses.
- [ Slurping ]
- But... ify.ou ask me... a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.
A beautiful bride, yes.
A glowing bride, ofcourse.
But sexy.is
- I-
I just don't know.
Personally, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
Really?
Do you have anything in red with a slit up to the hip?
- Red!
- She's kidding.
Just something with a little less piffand poof and no lace.
Oh, no lace?
No problem.
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin... that is to die for.
Great.
Areyou sureyou want to go through with this?
Did you know that Sam cheats at Monopoly and he snores?
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I workwith animals.
Hairy is a turn-on.
Honestly?
I was a goner the moment I saw him at the dog park.
There'sjustsomething about his impish smile and that twinkle in his ey.e.
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out ofthis thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.
Set them free.
Please tell meyou don't wear stufflike that every day.
What?
Lingerie?
I love it.
I've spent more on lingerie than I have on rent.
I haven't bought a new pair of underwear in over fouryears.
- [ Slurping ] - [ Chuckles ]
- Eww.
That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don'tyou try a dress on?
- No.
- Come on.
This one's only 1 0,000.
No way, no way.
Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.
Come on.
It will be fun.
Try it on.
Forget about it.
No way.
Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.
No!
What ifl damage it?
Shh.
Stay still while I get this zipper up.
[ Gasps ]
Ohh!
Did you cover me?
I was at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?
Yep.
But I told him you were at the gynecologist getting a pap smear.
It shut him up.
- Good one.
- Sowhatwereyou doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.
- No!
- Sorry.
I've been reading too many trashy magazines.
What?
He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
- No.
- Yes!
The wedding is this weekend.
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.
The worst thing is, I can't think ofa reason why he shouldn't marry her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
She's amazing.
Oh, please!
She's a gold-digging wench trying to hook her little claws into a resident surgeon... before he makes the bigbucks thatshe can laterget herhands on... in an ugly, ugly, ugly.
divorce settlement... that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping on the side, will handle.
You're not still taping All My.Children every day?
I tivo it.
But seriously, you must be flipping out that Sam is getting married...
Ieavingy.ou allalone, completely.single... with no realprospects in the future?
That's horrible.
I feel so bad fory.ou.
Promise me if I ever call you when I 'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.
Sure.
Here you go.
Can I get some change?
Kidding.
Don't spend it all on the slots.
Red 21.
This place is-This is awesome.
[ Chuckles ]
Check this out.
This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?
It's a satin-cotton blend.
Possibly Egyptian cotton ifthis is the high-roller room.
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.
'Causeyou're not doin' any high rollin' in this bed till tomorrow.
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.
You're not supposed to see the bride until tomorrow morning.
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall thatyou booked for me.
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.
Besides, we haven't been apart in six whole days.
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.
What areyou guys- What areyou guys gonna do without me?
- None ofyour business.
Seeyou at the chapel.
- Ow!
Violent.
You're gonna get socked.
Ow!
Ow!
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.
- Ninja claw!
Ohh!
- Hey!
[ Laughs ]
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane.
We have to take a bath.
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.
- Exactly.
- Right.
I'll order two bottles.
Ta-da!
[ Laughs ] I hope you didn't greet the room service guy like that.
Hmm.
Is that why he said he didn't need a tip?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Please tell meyou work out three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hateyou.
Ifl told you I had acne until I was 21, would that makeyou feel better?
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.
My nickname was "Connect the Dots."
[ Both Laughing ]
I have a toast.
To my soon-to-be sister-in-law and my newfound friend-
That's a bathing suityou're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, areyou?
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good since I was 1 7.
I'm not taking offa thing.
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know ifl should.
- You should.
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.
Though I did get kicked out ofthe Brownies for stealing money out of my cookie account.
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.
Relations as in intercourse.
I decided to wait, and I don't know ifthat was a mistake.
I mean, what ifhe's too big or ifI'm too small or-
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you to test drive a car beforeyou buy it?
[ Laughs ]
[Cheering, Applause ]
Thankyou.
Thankyou so much.
Thankyou very much.
Well...
I love Vegas, and I am certain that Vegas loves me... because I lost a bundle on the slots last night.
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know.
I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.
Formy.next number, I'dlike to give a warm welcome to my.surprise guest- the delightful and charming Miss Charlie Kelsey.
Yeah!
- You didn't.
- Did.
- You didn't!
- Did.
- Why?
- Ooh!
Come on, honey.
How areyou feeling this evening, Charlie?
Like I could throw up at any minute.
Well, that doesn't sound too pleasant.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean because ofyou.
I
- Can I just sit down, please?
Not too fast.
Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble... to heary.ousing a number with me tonight.
Twelve There, I sang a number.
I'm going home.
- Come on, girlfriend.
I think we can do this.
- [Piano:
Intro ]
We can do this.
We can do this.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[ Singing Disco ]
[ Singing Along ]
- Whoo!
- [ Continues ]
[ Gray] I can't believe I lost that much money.
Don't tell Sam.
- He liked you too.
- Why did that-
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.
Ah.
Mywedding shoes.
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.
- Can't.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
I'll helpyou.
- Mmm!
Sleeping.
[ Sighs ]
Oh.
Here.
Here's a shirt.
Doyou think the woman was mad... when I asked to see her husband's tattoo on his tush?
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.
I still don't know ifit was a ship or a- a bunny.
Did I tell you how happy I am you're gonna be my sister-in-law?
- About 1 7 times.
- Well, I mean it.
[ Moaning ]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
[ Spitting ]
I can't believe that just happened.
How can this be happening?
You're marrying my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.
[ Exhales ] Oh, this can't be happening.
This is just a mistake.
A meaningless, too-much-tequila mistake.
Oh, my God!
[ Buzzing ]
- [ Stops ] - [ Groans ]
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.
You're already dressed?
[ Groans ]
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?
Don'tyou thinkwe should talk?
Okay.
Can we talkwhile I get ready?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I guess.
- Great.
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.
- Areyou really upset?
- Yeah.
I would be too ifit were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.
I know it was one ofthose crazy, spontaneous moments... but don'tyou feel weird at all?
Not really.
I mean, I know it may seem strange...
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural.
I feel subnatural.
- [ Gargling ]
- In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.
But ifl phone home, Sam would answer, and thatwouldn't be good.
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?
Gray, come on.
Sit down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Anyone would tell you the exact same thing.
It is 1 00% normal to be feeling upset, sad, freaked out.
In fact, considering everything...
I thinkyou're handling the whole thing reallywell.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Your brother is getting married... and deep down insideyou feel likeyou're losing him.
That's whyyou think I'm freaking out?
You think I'm having separation anxiety?
[Organ]
[ Singing Gospel ]
There's only one thing that can keep a marriage together... andthat is love.
[ ChoirSinging]
Oh.
As the lucky.messenger ofour Lordand Savior above...
I look to the two ofyou with your bright smiles of devotion... and promise of commitment here in the very house ofthe Lord above!
[Resumes ]
- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask... ifthere's anybody here who has any objection whatsoever... to the union of these two lovebirds.
[ Hiccups ]
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Go ahead.
As I was say.ing... ifthere's anybody here who has an objection to the union... ofthese two love angels, speak their piece now.
[ Hiccups ]
Oh, my God!
Look out!
[ Screams ]
Your hiccups gone?
- Actually, yes.
- Good.
Great.
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.
- Right?
- Right.
Then by.the powervestedin me by.the glorious state ofNevada...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.
[ Gospel]
[Man Singing Pop ]
Hi.
I'd like a hot dog with kraut on one side and relish on the other... with ketchup on the kraut and mustard on the relish, but don't let the two touch.
[ Continues ]
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency.
Call me.
[ Continues ]
- [Fades ] - [ Sydney] Now reach to your right.
Station your left leg on the rock in the middle.
All right, Gray, what's really going on?
I canceled a session with someone today becauseyou said it was an emergency.
- It is.
- Well, then?
Take a deep breath- [ Inhales ]
- [ Exhales ]
- And tell me what's going on.
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine.
Then do that.
- [ Whispering ] I think I'm gay.
- What was that?
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?
It's like this.
Foryears, I thought I was content being single... and I wasn't really interested in a relationship.
I thought thatwhen Mr. Right came into my life, hejustwould.
He
- He wouldn't needsome fancy.invitation. He wouldjust arrive.
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right I'm waiting for.
It's Mrs. Right.
- Oh.
- And I think I found her.
And I kissed her- [ Sighs ] and I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
But I knowthat I likedit.
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.
Why.doy.ou thinky.ou feel nauseous?
Do you thinkyou committed some terrible sin just because you kissed a girl?
Why.?
Ify.ou're two consenting adults, what's so terrible about that?
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.
Oh, so you believe you forced her to kiss you?
No.
No, not at all.
She kissed me.
- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.
Y-You don't know what it's like.
One dayyou thinkyou're one thing... and the next dayyou realize you're something else.
I feel like I'm Dorothy in The WizardofOz.
I'm in this new land and I want to get home... but something is telling me maybe this is my home.
Maybe I shouldn't click my heels three times.
Maybe I should just stay here and be nauseous with the Munchkins.
What scares you most about this whole thing?
That I'll lose Sam and he'll never talk to me again.
Well, whywould Sam even care?
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset I kissed his wife.
- Whoa!
- [ Gasps ]
- Areyou all right?
- Oh, God.
Y-You're looking pale.
Maybeyou should take some deep breaths.
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a wreck.
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque, begging for forgiveness.
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.
I thinkwe need to talk about this on level ground.
You're not thinking straight.
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?
No.
What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.
You were so jealous ofCharlie... thatyou subconsciously tried to sabotage Sam's marriage.
Read my lips.
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...
- and my heart's telling me-
- Actually, our time is up for today.
Now, forget about Sam and get out there and date.
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?
Now, I will seeyou next week at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
Nice climb.
[ Exhales ]
My hotel is open.
I have suites,junior suites, deluxe accommodations available.
- Hey. [ Chuckles ]
- Hey.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
You know, actually, my grandfather once told me it's much nicer to say...
"That outfit looks very becoming on you."
- Well, thanks toyou and your pops.
- [ Laughs ]
Whoa.
That coffee smells great.
I'm on this no-caffeine kick right now... but I still find myselfhanging around Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.
[ Chuckles ] Actually, it's not all coffee.
It's one-third coffee, one-third cocoa, one-third chai... with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.
- Wow.
That's a new one. [ Chuckles ] - [ Chuckles ]
[ Inaudible ]
- What was that?
- Mmm
- Nothing.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
- Wow.
That-That took guts.
- [ Laughs ]
Would you?
Sure.
What time?
- Um, Raoul's at 1 0:00.
- All right.
Well, I'll seeyou then.
- [ElevatorBell Dings ]
- Great.
Areyou going up?
- Down.
- Okay.
Seeyou tonight.
- Oh!
- Are-Areyou okay?
- [ Chuckles ] - [ Indistinct ]
- Is anything sprained?
Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thankyou.
- Areyou sure?
- Yes.
[ Sighs ]
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, you know, I'm a pretty busy guy.
I'm usually booked up every night.
I'd have to- I'd have to check my schedule.
- Yeah!
Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.
- [ Sighs ]
- Cool.
[Bell Dings ]
[ Sam ] Hey, Gray.
Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?
Oh, you did some serious
- Oh!
Damage.
Holy smokes.
Look atyou.
What's the occasion?
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?
Yeah.
I got a 8:00 dinnerwith one, and I got a 1 0:00 dinnerwith the other.
That's great.
Did you get that rash you always get beforeyou go out?
- No.
Why did you remind me?
-Just trying to help.
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?
I wanted to check in, see when you thought you might getyour own place.
I know we get alonggreat, and Charlie lovesy.ou... but we are newlyweds so I thought you might- [ Clucks Tongue ]
Do you know how hard it is to find a rent-controlled place in the city?
Why do I have to be the one to move?
One, the lease is in my name, and, two, I found the apartment.
'Cause a 90-year-old woman died on your shift at the hospital.
Her bodywasn't even cold beforeyou were calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.
I didn't hearyou complaining.
As a matter offact, you went to her funeral.
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean likeyou.
You can't kick me out.
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.
I'm just saying maybe you should start looking, that's all.
- I hateyou!
I really do.
- Hey, hey!
Hey!
I can hearyou guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?
- I wasn'tyelling.
She was yelling.
- I was.
I hate him!
- Why?
What did he do now?
- Me?
- That's a little presumptuous, don'tyou think?
- He's kicking me out.
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.
We'll get our own place once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.
- Until then, it's fine.
I actually.kindoflike it.
- You do?
Yeah.
It's fun.
I love living with the both ofyou.
- What's wrong?
- Shit.
[ Chuckles ]
She has a couple of dates tonight...
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.
Hey.
I think- I don't know ifyou remember me...
- but I thinkyou drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida... and when you refer to Ginger's companion... you're not talking about sushi orwasabi.
- Not bad.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Where's that funny accent ofyours from?
- Oh... a funny place called Scotland.
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.
- Hmm.
How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.
I've had two auditions so far.
The first one was for the lead in a tampon spot- the role ofthe tampon, of course- and then, uh, the second one was a voice-over... for a pest-control infomercial.
And I didn't get that part.
They, uh-They said that they thought roaches didn't have accents.
I begged to differ, but I didn't want to seem argumentative.
Hmm.
- [ Sniffing ]
- Don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say?
I am a mess.
You don't look like a mess.
You look as cute as a button.
And buttons aren't messy.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
You know, back home in Scotland, I was captain ofthe local football team.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
And all my mates used to come to me with their problems.
They said I was pretty good.
So-
I'm all ears ifyou want to talk to someone from the outside, you know?
Hmm.
That's sweet, but it would take all night to tackle my laundry list.
Thanks.
- Keep the change.
- Thankyou.
I'm crazy aboutyou.
And I'm counting the minutes until I seeyou again.
- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.
We get paid to steal other people's lines.
Seeya.
Uh, seriously, though-
Could I giveyou a lift home tonight?
I couldcome andfetchy.ou about, say., just before midnight.
No charge.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.
With three olives and a tiny splash ofvermouth.
- Okay.
- And just a hint- a hint- of salt on the rim.
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Tonight we have a braised lamb shank... marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.
That's served with a creamedpumpkin squash.
We also have a grilled halibut steak... in a soy.-tamari lemon-zest glaze.
And that comes with grilled seaweed and an orange and almond salad.
Do we know what we'd like?
Yes.
I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin squash and the rosemary.-lime sauce... and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.
Excellent.
Coming right up.
Conrad, I'm impressed.
You duked the guy.
I didn't knowyou had it in you.
There's a lot in me thaty.ou don't know about.
I'm a burnin'sex machine just waitin'to be usedand abused by.y.ou.
The harder, the better.
- [ Barks ]
- Check, please.
...as much as I can, but it's not good.
- [ Gray.] How?
- I don't know.
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.
Soy.ou love Capra... you run in the park, you tango... you live for Italy., andy.ou hate asparagus.
Are you sure we weren't separated at birth?
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies... everyThursday since I was 1 5.
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.
Closed hand, deuces wild.
I love it when you talk dirty.
This is actually fun.
I have to admit.
I usually.dread the whole first-date thing.
You know, the awkward lulls in the conversation.
Then the anxious pain in the pit ofmy.stomach when I can't wait... for the night to end, but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.
Yeah, I'm feeling rather painless and "lull-less" myself.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
But, uh, I do want to be honest with you about something.
Oh, no.
Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.
[ Chuckles ]
See, I was so flattered with the way you asked me out in the elevator.
- I know.
Don't tell me.
You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married... but Stewart and I have been living together foryears.
- Yeah.
- Stewart-
- Am I a moron orwhat?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- I can't help it.
I'm hopeless.
- You're not.
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.
All you need is some space... some fresh air and some perspective.
Fresh air, space and perspective in New York City.
Stickwith me.
[ Gray.] This is unbelievable.
[ Cabdriver] Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah, it's one of the perks of the job.
I give J immy the doorman free rides... and he lets me come up here whenever I fancy.
[ I nhales ] I love this city.
- Oh, me too.
-[Laughs ]
You know, it's funny., 'cause sometimes, up here... everything is so tall and grand.
Even my biggest problems, you know... suddenly seem very wee.
Within seconds theyjust melt away like tiny dewdrops.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.
Ah, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist.
[ Exhales ] I've been wanting to do that... from the moment I sawyour face in my rearview mirror.
What's wrong?
Oh, Christ.
Was it awful?
I-I'm a wee bit out of practice.
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.
- Well, thankyou.
- [ Laughs ]
Your lips seem... nice and supple too.
But I'm sensing that, uh-
[ Exhales ] your heart's not doing the Riverdance thing that mine is.
Gordy, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- Forwhat?
For being me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.
I happen to think you're pretty dandy.
Soyou're gay.
Big deal.
- How did you know?
-Just a feeling, I suppose.
That and the fact thatyou haven't shut up about Charlie all night.
And every timeyou mentioned her nameyou got that little... sparkle thing in your eyes.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.
That's easy.
You're gonna move on with your life... start being the person thatyou're supposed to be... instead ofwasting your time pretending to be someone thatyou're not.
I mean, crikey.
Areyou not exhausted?
I am, but it's so much easier to keep pretending.
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!
Isn't it?
[ Laughs ]
As your newfound friend...
I am prescribing a remedy foryou.
That's part ofthe remedy.
This is the remedy.
"I am woman.
Hear me roar."
Helen Reddy.
She'll sortyou out.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
[Man On TV] There are a few things I'dlike to know abouty.ou too.
[Woman On TV] All right.
What wouldy.ou like to know?
[ Man ] Oh,just about anything.
Things y.ou like.
Things y.ou don't like.
Where y.ou went to school.
Who was y.our first beau.
What y.ou want out oflife.
- Mmm.
That's a tall order.
Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.
- Till the Clouds Roll By..
- I guess I like what every.one likes.
That's one of my favorite al l-ti me movies.
I know every line and every step.
Me too.
[ Big Band ]
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thankyou.
No.
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.
Will you dance with me?
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.
- Doyou know this dance?
- Yeah.
[Big Band]
[Continues ]
[Continues ]
- [DoorOpens ]
- What's goin' on?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.
Sorry.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?
- [ Continues ]
- She must be ovulating.
I heard that.
Huh?
- Howyou doin'?
- Howyou doin'?
[ Both Chuckling ]
Mmm.
She's the best.
Strong, independent, feisty.
- Who areyou talking about?
- Who else?
Queen Oprah.
Oprah.
Oprah the Great.
Oprah
- I love her.
Do you understand that I'm obsessed with her?
Like, I think she is so great that she should start her own religion.
I love herso much that ifshe andSteadman... couldn't have children and needed a little bit ofhelp...
I would surrogate a child for them.
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.
Wow.
That's a lot oflove.
Last night I was so inspired afterwatching her show about loving your body that-
- Doyou know what I did today?
- What?
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!
Yeah!
Can you believe it?
I quit.
Fergie, "smergie."
I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.
And if Dereck isn't going to love me for the tiny amount... of cellulite I have on the back of my thighs...
- then fuck him
- Screw that guy.
- Yeah.
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Hot!
- Thankyou.
I mean, why.does oursociety.push us... to be perpetually.uncomfortable with who we are?
It's so messed up.
You wanna know why.?
Here.
This is why.
" Boost your buttocks in five days."
" Luscious liposuction." "The flawless face-lift."
That's why.
Enough is enough.
We need to stop letting society.and-and media... and ourreligious leaders delegate who we are.
You're amazing, and I 'm even more amazing... and anybody who doesn't get it can go screw themselves!
[ Moans ]
[ Sighs ] That felt fantastic.
Spewing is a wonderful thing.
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.
That's what they should have.
[ Moans ]
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.
What arey.ou doinghere?
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.
This better be good.
I'm about to get prepped for surgery.
What is it?
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.
Maybeyou should just get prepped for surgery-
Maybeyou should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.
Gray.
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.
It's really major, and I don't know how to say it.
- Why don'tyou take three short breaths and one-
- One long.
[ Puffing ]
- I'm gay.
- What?
- As in Marvin.
- What?
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray," and
- Bingo!
Oh.
- [ Exhales ] - [ Exhales ]
- That's great.
- What about it is great?
- It's great thatyou're coming out.
- Don't tell meyou knew.
[Chuckling] Gray., ofcourse I knew.
How can you know when I didn't even know?
I'm smarter than you.
I've known since second grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?
Tell you, I'm proud ofyou, Gray.
- This is a big moment.
This is huge.
- It's big, all right... but there's one other thing I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.
Bigger.
Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.
- Well, I guess it depends on howyou see it.
- What is it?
- I'm in lovewith her.
- Who?
- Her.
- Who her?
- Yourwife.
- Whose wife?
Yours.
I'm in love with Charlie.
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would neverjoke about it.
I love the way she talked and walked and looked and felt... but it really kicked in afterwe kissed.
Kissed?
What doyou mean, kissed?
Areyou saying you kissed mywife?
Only once, and technically she wasn'tyourwife.
It was the night beforeyourwedding.
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.
Just tell me off.
Justyell at me.
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
Gray, I wantyou to pack upyour shit and get it out ofthe apartment... by the time I get home tonight, because we're done.
All right?
We're done.
[Charlie ] There has to be a reason.
Whywould she move out without talking to us about it... or even telling us where she was going?
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?
It's not supposed to mean anything.
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.
Aren'tyou happywe'll have the place to ourselves?
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?
Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- What aren'tyou telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird.
You loveyour sister.
Yes, I love my sister.
How aboutyou?
Doyou love my sister?
Of course I loveyour sister.
I think she's great.
"Great." How great?
- What areyou getting at?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You know what?
I'm late.
I gotta go, okay?
I'll seeyou later.
Sam?
[Salsa Beat]
[Continues ]
[Ends ]
So as you can see, the consumers love to think of nothing but C-Pro.
- B-Pro.
- What?
- B-Pro.
You said "C-Pro."
- I did?
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass ofwater.
Takeyour time.
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.
- [ Groans ]
- Gray, hang in there.
You're doing just fine.
- No, I'm not doing fine.
I'm the Titanic.
- No!
- Yes.
- You just gotta-You gotta get focused.
You gotta centeryourself, and you gotta march back in there... and you show them who's the boss.
Who's the Boss?
I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light had reallyweird hair, but-
Gray!
You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?
You gotta get out ofyour head and get intoyour body.
Get out ofyour head and into your body.
Get out ofyour head and into your body.
Get out ofyour head.
Get out ofyour head.
Get out ofyour head and into your body.
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Centeryourself.
[ Exhales ]
- And go.
- Go.
Go.
[Lana ] Gimme a '"P."Gimme an '"R. "
Gimme an "O."
What's that spell?
B-Pro!
Yeah!
Whoo!
[ Giggling ]
Lana, what the hell areyou doing?
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative executive on the Bartlett account... because I thought it would be best to showJulia two perspectives.
- You mean the one ofher tits and the one ofher ass?
- Gray!
I'm sure that Lana has 36 double-D ideas... forthe account, and I'lljust givey.ou yourprivacy.to fondle through them.
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.
I'm sure it cost me my job.
Well, with copy like that, they should be begging you to stay.
Here.
Drink that while it's still hot.
That, young lady, is my granny's secret recipe.
Mmm!
This is so good.
What's in this?
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey and a wee bit of nutmeg.
Gordy.,y.ou are amazing.
You barely.knowme andy.ou're such a great friend.
You're gonna make some lucky girl very happy one day.
So are you.
God, everything is so complicated.
If it was 30 years ago, I could just move away and join a convent.
- Those outfits are so hideous.
- [ Chuckles ]
You know, ifyou want my advice- and I don't supposeyou do, but I'm going to give it toyou anyway.
- I thinkyou have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?
You have to tell her the truth.
- I can't do that.
- Yes,y.ou can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I mean, for all you know, she might feel the same way about you.
Come on.
Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.
Buty.ou won't know that untily.ou talk to her.
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?
What ifyou go through your entire life saying, "What if?"
What happens if she does feel the same way?
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.
- He doesn't talk toyou now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.
And doyou foresee that ever changing?
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm.Just drinkyour tea.
This is so good.
Areyou sure this is just tea, nutmeg and honey?
Wee bit ofwhiskey.
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!
What kind ofshortbread is this?
- Mmm, short.
- [ Chuckles ]
[Gray.] God, they.'re so beautiful andmagicalandpeaceful.
Will they.have babies here?
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality among mammals.
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales... but did you know that over 50% of elephants are gay?
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People... over loudspeakers and watch their feet.
- I'm kidding.
- [ Laughs ]
So where'veyou been hiding?
I've left three messages and no answer, and Sam won't say a word.
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.
Anything you want to talk about?
Doyou remember that night we spent together in Las Vegas beforeyou got married to Sam?
Barely.
I mean, I remember having a great time... but I thinkyou got me too drunk to remember anything else.
Why?
Did I say something really stupid?
- It's not whatyou said.
- God.
What did I do?
I don't know ifyou did anything.
It might havejust been me.
- Oh, my God.
I remember.
- You do?
- Yes.
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.
How could you let your brother marry me?
I didn't know ifyou were conscious ofwhat was going on.
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?
I sounded like a cat in heat, didn't I?
Is that whatyou think we're talking about?
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?
- No.
That was it.
- Areyou sure?
- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.
Did you try to convince Sam not to marry me?
There was no convincing him.
Trust me.
Ifl could have, I would have.
You know, every morning I wake up before Sam does... and I just watch him.
I just lie there and stare.
And I love the way his nose wrinkles when he's dreaming... and the little purring sound that he makes when he's about to wake up.
Andthe way.that he keeps his hand on my.thigh the whole night... just to let me know that he's there.
And I know it may.seem crazy.... but love is crazy, isn't it?
[ Laughing ] It sure is.
[ Woman Singing Pop ]
- [Door Opens ] - [ Continues ]
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?
You're so lucky..
I neverhada brother orsister.
Oh!
[ Groans ]
[ Continues ]
I don't know what's going on between the two ofy.ou... but you have to work it out, Sam.
J ust talk to her.
[ Continues ]
[ Ends ]
[ Chuckling]
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah.
Gray.
Seems J ulia wasn't thrilled with the way our last presentation went.
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated or patronized anymore.
- Actually, I was gonna giveyou a promotion, but-
- What?
I asked Jordan to makeyou the executive creative director on my account... and to giveyou free rein to do whateveryou want.
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea was yours.
I thinky.ou have great ideas.
You just haven't been given the freedom to explore them fully.
I like your energy, your spunk, your candidness... and I think with the right support... you're gonna give me exactlywhat I'm looking for.
Wow!
- I don't know what to say.
- [Woman On Intercom ] Sorry.to interrupt, Gray.... buty.our 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics is in the small conference room.
Oh, I don't have a 1 2:00 meeti ng with Brother Electronics.
They.said they. confirmed it with y.our office.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.
Thankyou so much.
You will not be sorry.
Thankyou, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.
Isn't she adorable?
[ Chuckles ]
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't haveyou in my book.
Hey.
See,y.ou forgoty.ourtoothbrush... and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard, part soft bristles... must be hard to come by.
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?
And to say I'm sorry.
I overreacted- Little bit.
Not a lot.
Little bit.
After all, you have to admit... it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...
I'm not quite sure why I got so surprised... 'cause ifyou think about it... it's almost inevitable thatyou and I would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?
You're acting- You're acting very rational.
It's too rational.
You used to do this when we were kids.
Then I'd turn around and you'd tackle me.
I should be getting my knees in the lock-down position.
You know, Gray-
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.
You know that, right?
Being without you I feel like one half of me is missing.
Lately I've been feeling very lopsided.
- Oh, Sam.
-Just 'causeyou're totally gay... and in love with mywife doesn't mean we can't work things out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.
Now, this is good.
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!
[ Gray Squeals ]
- [ GrayWhimpering ] Oh, my- - [ Sam ] Gray!
Gray!
Gray!
How ya doin'?
How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.
Putyour eyes back in your heads.
[ Whimpering ]
[Bell Dings ]
- Hey, what- - [Alarm Bell Ringing]
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.
- I neverwanna see another human being ever again.
- No.
Look.
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad-
Who cares what those people think?
I care.
They're probably calling Jerry Springer right now as we speak.
No.
No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry forwhat?
For having to be related to me.
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel- [ Groans ]
Gray, look.
You're just- You're just coming out, okay?
- I am never coming out ofthis elevator.
- This is probably... the biggest revelation ofyour entire life.
It's normal to be going nuts.
- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.
I don't feel any ofthose things.
Well, how doyou feel?
- Lonely.
- Why?
Because I'm never gonna be able to walk down the street... holding hands with my partner... without the rest ofthe world giving us a look.
I may never have the wedding that I once dreamed of... and I may never have children... and one day, when I die... people will never give as much respect to my grieving lover... as if she were my husband.
Gray...
- it's not as ifyou made a choice.
- [Sobs ]
That's what terrifies me.
It's so much easier to be someone else.
Doyou remember when we were kids- you wouldhave been aboutsix- and Dad came home to tell Mom he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.
Yeah.
Rememberwe stay.ed in the closet all night... just cuddled up like two little mice and...
Iistened to theirwhole fight.
I was... so angry.
I was... hurt.
I was just-
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there and kick his ass...
- and you rememberwhatyou said to me?
- Hmm.
You were just six... butyou said it was gonna be okay... that Dad was not gonna live a lie... that he was gonna try and be happy... and that everyone deserved to be happy.
I said that?
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.
Why are you being so nice to me?
- You should hate me.
- Forwhat?
For having good taste?
You never have to worry about it.
I mean, she's completely, madly, passionately...
like cow-jump-over-the-moon in love with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great... for me.
Not so great foryou.
But you're not gonna make me feel guilty for this areyou?
Mm-mmm.
Gray, you know what?
You can't expect the first girl thatyou fall in love with... to loveyou back.
That's-That's not how it works.
That would be the equivalent of settling down when you were age 1 2.
You haven't gone through gay pubertyyet.
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?
- No.
Ofthe elevator.
- Ofthe elevator.
[ Carrie ] I should have broken up with Dereck ages ago.
I am having the best time.
- So what aboutyou?
Haveyou met anyoneyet?
- Notyet.
Really?
Girls should be lining up around the block foryou.
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?
It depends, I guess.
- Funny.
You need funny.
- Funnywould be good.
- And stylish.
No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.
And for the love ofGod, don't wind up... with one ofthose ladies who doesn't believe in waxing.
- You're killing me.
- Can I askyou a question?
- Yeah.
- Haveyou ever been attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
- Not even a little?
- No.
- Huh.
Oh.
Not even last year, when I was in shape after taking those Pilates classes?
Or last weekwhen I wore that pink MarcJacobs dress to work... and you told me how cute I looked?
You looked so cute.
You are cute, but, you know, not cute that way, cute.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's so depressing.
It's not like I'm into girls, but ifl was a girl who was into girls...
I'd definitely be into me, 'cause I think I'm a catch.
You are a catch, but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.
Hmm.
Butyou said you don't have a type.
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.
Wait.
Don'tyou usually have therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?
Oh, my God.
I'm so late.
Shoot.
Okay.
You know, I don't reallywant to go, so watch this.
[ Beeping ]
Sydney, it's Gray.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't wanna go to the batting cages... and I don't wanna go rock climbing or bowling or anywhere with you... 'cause I'm feeling really good about myself... and I don't thinkyou're a very good therapist for me, soyou're fired.
- Thankyou, and have a nice day.
- [ Laughs ]
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?
That was amazing.
[ Exhales ] Doyou want to get a mani-pedi before we go back to work?
- Sure.
I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.
What ifl dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?
- Yes.
- Really?
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!
[Woman Vocalizing]
[Disco Beat]
[Woman Vocalizing]
I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?
Because you're gay, and you have to start behaving' like it.
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?
No, butyou haven't had sex with a woman yet... and, you know, that's like being black... and never having listened to theJackson Five... or being Jewish and never having a knish... or being Indian and never having had a curry or being-
Or being Scottish and not keeping your mouth shut?
- I suppose so.
Come on.
- Hi.
Sorry.
No men allowed.
Wh
- Isn't that against the law?
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.
- No exceptions.
No men.
- Forget it.
Well,just go in byyourself.
I can't go in by myself.
Areyou kidding?
I have an idea.
[ In Falsetto] I would like an Apricot Sour, please.
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.
And a touch oflemon and a squeeze oflime.
And a little bit ofsugar on the rim.
Comin' up.
Apricot Sour?
I thought thatwas whatyou women drank, for Christ's sakes.
- One ofyour eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.
Hi.
Can I buyyou a drink?
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.
See, but thanks.
You don't?
- Shut up.
- [ Giggling ]
This is quite tasty, actually.
Let's get out ofhere.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.
Hey, give it a minute.
Oh, my.God. It'sJulia Bartlett.
- Quick, quick.
I gotta get out ofhere.
- Why?
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello.
Is there anybody in?
No.
Her?
You think?
Gray, did your mom ever tell you... what your I.Q. scores were?
[ Chuckles ]
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.
- It's nice to seeyou.
- Nice to seeyou too.
I'm just taking a break from working on your account.
Gray, I didn't come over here to check up on you.
[ Both Laughing ]
Um, hello.
Uh, my name's Georgette.
- Hi.
- Nice to meetyou.
And, uh, lovely.
And I'm just gonna leaveyou two to, uh- to, uh- to catch up on everything.
- Mmm.
Lovely.
- Don't go.
Yeah, it was lovely to seeyou too.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Dutch way-Three kisses.
So, uh-
Fine.
It's fine.
I'm fine.
You're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, and I've got to go now.
Bye.
You really surprised me the other day.
I had no idea you were gay.
[ Exhales ] That makes two of us.
You're not just coming out, areyou?
Put it this way.
My hotel's been closed for a long time... but tonight's the grand opening.
There have been a few fake openings... but tonight's the real deal.
[ Laughs ] I
- No, I don't understand.
[ Whispering ] Yes, I'm just coming out.
[ Whispering ] I don't think anyone in herewill mind.
[ Both Laughing ]
You really are adorable.
I always thought so.
Really?
From day one, in that little cream, pin-striped suityou werewearing.
I like that suit too.
I think I got it at, uh, Banana Republic.
Or maybe it was, uh, Emporio Armani.
Actually, it could have been Barneys, but the shirt was from Bloomies.
Listen.
I have this beautiful bottle ofcognac... that Ijust brought back from France, and I would-
- I 'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?
No.
My place.

Uh, okay, well-

I have brandy too.

What are you doing?
Come back.
- No.
- Come on.
Turn around.
Hey, hey!
You're the best.
You're amazing.
What do you say?
Beers on me.
Cold beers on me.
Let's go!
Wonderful.
Weren't they wonderful?
Come on.
Keep it going, Gray.
- Hey.
- Help!
- Okay.
- Help.
Ohh.
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?
- Yeah.
Mmm.
- What do you got?
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.
- And chicken.
- Good.
- And fish.
- And fish.
- And tofu.
- Good.
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great.
We got tempeh.
Then I got the regular essentials, like asparagus and lettuce.
I got it.
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay?
Let's...
Hello?
Hey, Carrie.
Who?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, honey.
- Dinner?
No.
We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.
- We go out.
I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.
Do you want something fruity or full-bodied and do...
Okay.
Okay.
What...
Californian, French, Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span...
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have to yell.
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.
That is amazing.
Oh, my God.
Carrie.
Do you believe this?
Ta-da!
I would like to say something.
To Carrie and Dereck and their lovely friends.
Oh, my goodness.
I don't know what it means, but it sounded beautiful.
- It's a fake accent.
He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?
- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.
And poofs are rarely beefy.
I wrote a piece about that in a magazine once.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Carrie, do you have the new Liza Minnelli CD?
- Mmm.
Okay, and scratch my last comment.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.
- Oh, uh, more for you,yeah?
- Yes.
- Red or white?
- I'll have red.
Actually, I'll have white.
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.
- All right.
- Um, well, Julia Bartlett is not an easygoing client.
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.
Oh, honey.
Doesn't mean you're getting a promotion before me.
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what do you do?
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital... with a specialty in, uh...
heart transplants.
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.
And how long have you two been together?
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.
Thirty years.
- I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- No.
- Gray's my sister.
Oh, my God!
No!
Ick!
No, I'm...
I just...
I thought that you two were an item.
Well, I just...
- What?
These-These two?
- Well, yeah.
You seem so...
So?
I don't know.
So together, I guess.
Hey, what'd I miss?
- Um, she thinks we're together.
- Like "together" together?
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!
You're not the first one to think that, Elaine.
- Let me tell you.
- What?
- They're very codependent.
- We are not!
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart.
But if that's...
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.
How about that...
Remember?
You want to know something?
I've even seen them share the same toothbrush.
- One time.
- Oh, ick.
- One time is... it's creepy.
- I...
Listen.
I think that your relationship is charming.
- Thank you.
- Have you ever French-kissed?
That's beautiful.
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?
You know, the sisters that were 103 and 105, and they never got married... and they just did yoga and headstands together every day.
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.
- I'm serious.
We need to venture out.
- To where?
When?
I'm too busy to date, and I'm not goin' to bars.
The girls there, all they do is they talk about how fat they are.
They're not fat.
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.
You know what I want?
I want a girl who's not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay... and have no guilt attached, that's what I want.
Can't you meet a cute intern at the hospital?
Wrong.
Can't do it.
Too dangerous.
You can't have sexual tension and cut an artery.
It's awkward.
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl for you, and you look for a guy for me...
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers is one of the Spice Girls.
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.
Somebody who doesn't think Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.
Someone who would call me an hour after our first date and say...
"I am crazy about you, and I'm counting the minutes until I could see you again."
That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.
Eatin' with your fingers, things.
It's quite festive.
Hey, Jimmy.
Happy birthday!
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry about that.
Hey, Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
My Weight Watchers meeting went over, and it was too good to leave.
Why do you still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.
He has nerve.
He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know.
Right?
But trust me.
The entertainment factor alone is worth it.
Today, it was so crazy.
There was this woman who was all mad at her husband for not letting her have dessert.
So she breaks into the Soho Chocolate Factory... and tried to drown herself in a vat of chocolate.
- No.
- Yes.
- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka?
- Exactly.
It's like the cuckoo show.
Ooh, let's see who's in Page Six today.
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes... with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds like a crossing guard wrote it.
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.
- It's so cool and kitsch.
Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana?
Don't listen to Lana.
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?
I do think she does a lot more than just type for him.
- Give it up.
- Okay.
You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.
- Yeah.
- Lana...
Wait, I feel like somebody's listening...
Lana goes to Kemiko, my pedicurist... and told her, who then told Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!
I know it's accurate gossip 'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me to do some research for him, so...
Oh, really?
Oh, that's too bad.
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Bye.
Research my ass.
You mean her ass.
B-Pro.
The campaign...
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.
It's on, sir.
Carry on, Gray.
The campaign exudes nostalgia, comedy... thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion all under one banner.
It'll appeal to a wide demographic and leads the consumer... with an emotional end benefit of feeling charged up.
To challenge themselves and seize the day and be the best they can be.
Whoo!
Well, Julia?
And I must say you look fantastic.
What do you think?
Great, no?
No.
- N-N-No?
- No.
Well, it's, uh... it's just an initial proposal.
I mean, it still needs to be tweaked and tuned.
You only tweak or tune if something has potential.
Uh, we'll, uh... we'll go back to the drawing board then, that's all.
Why don't you call me when you have something original to present?
Julia, I'm sure we have a bunch of...
Shut that thing off.
I'm sure we have a bunch of things.
This is just one of them.
What's wrong with you?
That was crap.
J...
Julia, just a second.
I don't know, Sydney.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
How come every road I take turns out to be a dead end?
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.
At least with a fork there's a choice...
right or left or east or west...
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you think you always reach these dead ends?
Ooh!
You see, gutter ball.
That's my life... a bunch of gutter balls.
Well, this is a perfect example... of why having therapy in different locations is so important.
Look at the deep symbolism in that gutter ball.
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.
Can you think of one word that best describes...
- the way your work situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?
- No, one.
- Um...
Ohh!
Frustrated.
- You're up.
- Right.
Okay, another word... for how you really feel when your brother wins all your races.
- Frustrated.
- Okay.
Another word for how you feel when you think about going on a date.
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.
I know.
But I can't help it.
It's a weird thing, but I see myself as this charming hotel... that's beautifully romantic and... wonderful on the outside... but on the inside, it just needs a ton of renovations.
Hence, closed for repairs.
Nice analogy.
What kinds of renovations?
Getting a promotion at work, perfecting the tango... disowning my mother, getting liposuction under my chin.
There's nothing worse than chin fat.
Uh, I think you need to... let the idea of sharing your life with someone other than your brother... enter your consciousness.
But how can I be conscious of something that I'm unconscious of?
It's not like I don't date.
I've had plenty of boyfriends.
Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.
Let's try something.
How about keeping the hotel closed... but keeping the veranda open for cocktails?
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front...
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out of time today... but we will resume this conversation next week at the rock climbing wall.
Nice game.
And what happened to going to a movie?
How are you going to meet anyone in a dark movie theater?
How are you going to meet anyone at a dog park?
Hello?
The dog park is a vortex for singles.
Hello?
When did we become dog owners?
No.
I wash my hand of this whole fiasco.
You're on your own.
Ow!
Grabbing.
- Check out center field.
- What about cen...
Ahh!
Ohh!
Yes!
Holy... smokes.
I'll do the preinterview.
If she's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"
- and you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball."
- What?
- There's no way she's single.
- Do what I say.
- You know what?
Don't get bossy.
- Ow!
Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt.
Spazzy men are not attractive.
Some spazzy men are attractive.
- Gosh.
You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.
- Or should I say 21 ?
- She's legal.
Yeah.
I suppose I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?
Maybe a liver martini with a beef jerky twist?
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.
Originally Charlotte, but it always seemed too long and never quite suited me, so...
I'm Gray.
You can't really shorten that or it'd be "Gra."
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.
- Dancing?
Are you athletic?
- Uh...
- Do you watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well...
Do you have a boyfriend?
What is your favorite dessert?
Okay.
Um, uh...
Let's see.
I'm a 1940s movie buff.
I love to swing dance.
I've never been very good at sports... um, love the Discovery Channel, "nix-ay" on the boyfriend... and, well, it's kind of a toss-up.
I-I like cheesecake, but I kind of love... those big, gooey hot fudge sundaes, so...
Get the ball.
Who's that?
Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute.
What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- Suki.
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.
Oh, well, you are so adorable.
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.
He's one...
He's one-five.
He's 15.
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.
Sam.
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people... that illegally keeps endangered animals in their apartment, like that guy... that got caught with a leopard in his kitchen?
No.
I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at New York Aquarium.
- Ha!
That's a relief.
- Free Willy is my favorite movie.
Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.
And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.
Orca.
Orca not so much.
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.
I'm staying on a friend's sofa for right now.
I just moved here from San Francisco about three weeks ago.
- I love San Francisco.
- Really?
Have you spent much time there?
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.
I know I've never been to San Francisco, but I know I would love it.
Tony Bennett loves it.
He left his heart there.
I love Tony Bennett.
There you go.
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?
Yeah.
You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons, 'cause we love that dog.
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny.
Gypsy's not mine either.
I dog walk on the side for extra cash.
I should probably get her back, so...
Oh.
It was really nice to meet you both.
- Nice meeting you both...
You.
- Nice meeting you.
- What are you waiting for?
- What?
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.
All right.
Uh, excuse me!
Since you're new in town, if you're not doing anything tonight, maybe you'd join us?
We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine, if you'd like to join us.
I just said that.
Would you like to join us?
Three times.
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Okay.
!
Perfecto!
R-R-R-ico.
R-R-R-R-R.
R-R-R-R-R-R-Rico.
Oh, easy, Pancho Villa.
These girls are conmigo.
More vino, por favor.
!
A yayay, oh!
Gracias.
Gracias.
Carlos!
Cover me!
I'm goin' in.
Okay, best food movie.
- Like Water For Chocolate.
- Babette's Feast.
How about Babette's Feast?
- Okay.
- Okay, Fatso starring Dom DeLuise.
- Yes.
- Oh, good one.
Okay, is it me?
Let's see.
Uh, women you need to get away from.
Bette Davis in What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?
Ah, good one.
I got Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction for the rabbit.
- Kathy Bates in Misery.
- Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout, um, best screen kiss?
- Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.
- That's overrated, I think.
I'll go with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Notorious.
Okay.
I'll see your Notorious... and I'll raise you Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.
- Very good.
- Oh, wait.
I'll see your Doctor Zhivago... and I will raise you Lady and the Tramp in Lady and the Tramp.
Winner.
Winner.
The spaghetti pooch smooch.
Nothing better.
Thank God we're home.
My toes are even starting to swell.
I'm exhausted.
Dogs are barking?
No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.
I'm wide awake.
I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.
- Oh, yeah?
Me too.
You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.
Let's go to Soho House or Sway or like a diner or something.
Ow.
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?
Big meeting in the morning you have to get to?
Oh, that big meeting.
Actually, I'm pretty tired.
I should go to bed.
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay.
Good night.
I hope we can do this again.
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.
Night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got in late last night.
I didn't even hear you come in.
- I'm just getting in now.
- Sounds like you had a good time.
- It was more than good.
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.
Don't blow it.
You're off to a strong start, but a girl can sense a "glommer."
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes.
Glommer.
- I know.
I...
Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy...
- I know she doesn't...
- She could think you're a glommer and you don't know.
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.
What?
And she said yes.
Can you believe it?
We got our blood work done this morning, and we're going to Vegas this weekend...
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?
I know.
It's amazing.
It's like...
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's incredible.
You know what she is?
She's...
She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.
She's the jackpot.
She's it.
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.
You know what she isn't?
An ax murderer.
You know what she is?
Perfect.
She's perfect.
Gray, remember what Mom always used to say?
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me.
It's right.
Mom is divorced for the third time, and she lives in a commune.
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."
I'm not jealous of you when you're totally psychologically unstable.
I'm psychologically unstable?
I'm psyc...
You're the one that said "Get the ball."
I said "Get the ball," not "Get the ring."
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend, and we are gonna get married.
You can come with us.
I booked you a room.
I booked you a flight.
If you come, great.
And if you don't, that's your deal.
- But you know what?
I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?
One minute you know someone, the next minute they're so desperate...
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.
She doesn't have a lot of friends in the city, and I thought it'd be fun for you two.
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.
If you want sexy, I got sexy.
I mean, I know you kids aren't Little Bo Peep underneath those dresses.
But... if you ask me... a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.
A beautiful bride, yes.
A glowing bride, of course.
But sexy is...
I...
I just don't know.
Personally, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
Really?
Do you have anything in red with a slit up to the hip?
- Red!
- She's kidding.
Just something with a little less piff and poof and no lace.
Oh, no lace?
No problem.
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin... that is to die for.
Great.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Did you know that Sam cheats at Monopoly and he snores?
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I work with animals.
Hairy is a turn-on.
Honestly?
I was a goner the moment I saw him at the dog park.
There's just something about his impish smile and that twinkle in his eye.
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out of this thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.
Set them free.
Please tell me you don't wear stuff like that every day.
What?
Lingerie?
I love it.
I've spent more on lingerie than I have on rent.
I haven't bought a new pair of underwear in over four years.
- Eww.
That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don't you try a dress on?
- No.
- Come on.
This one's only 10,000.
No way, no way.
Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.
Come on.
It will be fun.
Try it on.
Forget about it.
No way.
Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.
No!
What if I damage it?
Shh.
Stay still while I get this zipper up.
Ohh!
Did you cover me?
I was at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?
Yep.
But I told him you were at the gynecologist getting a pap smear.
It shut him up.
- Good one.
- So what were you doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.
- No!
- Sorry.
I've been reading too many trashy magazines.
What?
He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
- No.
- Yes!
The wedding is this weekend.
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.
The worst thing is, I can't think of a reason why he shouldn't marry her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
She's amazing.
Oh, please!
She's a gold-digging wench trying to hook her little claws into a resident surgeon... before he makes the big bucks that she can later get her hands on... in an ugly, ugly, ugly divorce settlement... that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping on the side, will handle.
You're not still taping All My Children every day?
I TiVo it.
But seriously, you must be flipping out that Sam is getting married... leaving you all alone, completely single... with no real prospects in the future?
That's horrible.
I feel so bad for you.
Promise me if I ever call you when I'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.
Sure.
Here you go.
Can I get some change?
Kidding.
Don't spend it all on the slots.
Red 21.
This place is...
This is awesome.
Check this out.
This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?
It's a satin-cotton blend.
Possibly Egyptian cotton if this is the high-roller room.
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.
'Cause you're not doin' any high rollin' in this bed till tomorrow.
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.
You're not supposed to see the bride until tomorrow morning.
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall that you booked for me.
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.
Besides, we haven't been apart in six whole days.
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.
What are you guys...
What are you guys gonna do without me?
- None of your business.
See you at the chapel.
- Ow!
Violent.
You're gonna get socked.
Ow!
Ow!
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.
- Ninja claw!
Ohh!
- Hey!
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane.
We have to take a bath.
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.
- Exactly.
- Right.
I'll order two bottles.
Ta-da!
I hope you didn't greet the room service guy like that.
Hmm.
Is that why he said he didn't need a tip?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Please tell me you work out three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hate you.
If I told you I had acne until I was 21, would that make you feel better?
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.
My nickname was "Connect the Dots."
I have a toast.
To my soon-to-be sister-in-law and my newfound friend...
That's a bathing suit you're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, are you?
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good since I was 17.
I'm not taking off a thing.
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know if I should.
- You should.
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.
Though I did get kicked out of the Brownies for stealing money out of my cookie account.
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.
Relations as in intercourse.
I decided to wait, and I don't know if that was a mistake.
I mean, what if he's too big or if I'm too small or...
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you to test drive a car before you buy it?
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Well...
I love Vegas, and I am certain that Vegas loves me... because I lost a bundle on the slots last night.
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know.
I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.
For my next number, I'd like to give a warm welcome to my surprise guest... the delightful and charming Miss Charlie Kelsey.
Yeah!
- You didn't.
- Did.
- You didn't!
- Did.
- Why?
- Ooh!
Come on, honey.
How are you feeling this evening, Charlie?
Like I could throw up at any minute.
Well, that doesn't sound too pleasant.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean because of you.
I...
Can I just sit down, please?
Not too fast.
Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble... to hear you sing a number with me tonight.
#Twelve # There, I sang a number.
I'm going home.
Come on, girlfriend.
I think we can do this.
We can do this.
We can do this.
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whoo!
I can't believe I lost that much money.
Don't tell Sam.
- He liked you too.
- Why did that...
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.
Ah.
My wedding shoes.
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.
- Can't.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
I'll help you.
- Mmm!
Sleeping.
Oh.
Here.
Here's a shirt.
Do you think the woman was mad... when I asked to see her husband's tattoo on his tush?
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.
I still don't know if it was a ship or a... a bunny.
Did I tell you how happy I am you're gonna be my sister-in-law?
- About 17 times.
- Well, I mean it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that just happened.
How can this be happening?
You're marrying my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.
Oh, this can't be happening.
This is just a mistake.
A meaningless, too-much-tequila mistake.
Oh, my God!
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.
You're already dressed?
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?
Don't you think we should talk?
Okay.
Can we talk while I get ready?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I guess.
- Great.
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.
- Are you really upset?
- Yeah.
I would be too if it were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.
I know it was one of those crazy, spontaneous moments... but don't you feel weird at all?
Not really.
I mean, I know it may seem strange...
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural.
I feel subnatural.
In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.
But if I phone home, Sam would answer, and that wouldn't be good.
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?
Gray, come on.
Sit down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Anyone would tell you the exact same thing.
It is 100% normal to be feeling upset, sad, freaked out.
In fact, considering everything...
I think you're handling the whole thing really well.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Your brother is getting married... and deep down inside you feel like you're losing him.
That's why you think I'm freaking out?
You think I'm having separation anxiety?
There's only one thing that can keep a marriage together... and that is love.
Oh.
As the lucky messenger of our Lord and Savior above...
I look to the two of you with your bright smiles of devotion... and promise of commitment here in the very house of the Lord above!
- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask... if there's anybody here who has any objection whatsoever... to the union of these two lovebirds.
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Go ahead.
As I was saying... if there's anybody here who has an objection to the union... of these two love angels, speak their piece now.
Oh, my God!
Look out!
Your hiccups gone?
- Actually, yes.
- Good.
Great.
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.
- Right?
- Right.
Then by the power vested in me by the glorious state of Nevada...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.
Hi.
I'd like a hot dog with kraut on one side and relish on the other... with ketchup on the kraut and mustard on the relish, but don't let the two touch.
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency.
Call me.
Now reach to your right.
Station your left leg on the rock in the middle.
All right, Gray, what's really going on?
I canceled a session with someone today because you said it was an emergency.
- It is.
- Well, then?
Take a deep breath...
And tell me what's going on.
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine.
Then do that.
- I think I'm gay.
- What was that?
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?
It's like this.
For years, I thought I was content being single... and I wasn't really interested in a relationship.
I thought that when Mr. Right came into my life, he just would.
He...
He wouldn't need some fancy invitation.
He would just arrive.
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right I'm waiting for.
It's Mrs. Right.
- Oh.
- And I think I found her.
And I kissed her... and I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
But I know that I liked it.
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.
Why do you think you feel nauseous?
Do you think you committed some terrible sin just because you kissed a girl?
Why?
If you're two consenting adults, what's so terrible about that?
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.
Oh, so you believe you forced her to kiss you?
No.
No, not at all.
She kissed me.
- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.
Y-You don't know what it's like.
One day you think you're one thing... and the next day you realize you're something else.
I feel like I'm Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
I'm in this new land and I want to get home... but something is telling me maybe this is my home.
Maybe I shouldn't click my heels three times.
Maybe I should just stay here and be nauseous with the Munchkins.
What scares you most about this whole thing?
That I'll lose Sam and he'll never talk to me again.
Well, why would Sam even care?
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset I kissed his wife.
Whoa!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God.
Y-You're looking pale.
Maybe you should take some deep breaths.
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a wreck.
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque, begging for forgiveness.
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.
I think we need to talk about this on level ground.
You're not thinking straight.
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?
No.
What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.
You were so jealous of Charlie... that you subconsciously tried to sabotage Sam's marriage.
Read my lips.
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...
- and my heart's telling me...
- Actually, our time is up for today.
Now, forget about Sam and get out there and date.
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?
Now, I will see you next week at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
Nice climb.
My hotel is open.
I have suites, junior suites, deluxe accommodations available.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
You know, actually, my grandfather once told me it's much nicer to say...
"That outfit looks very becoming on you."
Well, thanks to you and your pops.
Whoa.
That coffee smells great.
I'm on this no-caffeine kick right now... but I still find myself hanging around Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.
Actually, it's not all coffee.
It's one-third coffee, one-third cocoa, one-third chai... with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.
Wow.
That's a new one.
- What was that?
- Mmm...
Nothing.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Wow.
That...
That took guts.
Would you?
Sure.
What time?
- Um, Raoul's at 10:00.
- All right.
Well, I'll see you then.
Great.
Are you going up?
- Down.
- Okay.
See you tonight.
- Oh!
- Are-Are you okay?
- Is anything sprained?
Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, you know, I'm a pretty busy guy.
I'm usually booked up every night.
I'd have to...
I'd have to check my schedule.
- Yeah!
Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.
Cool.
Hey, Gray.
Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?
Oh, you did some serious...
Oh!
Damage.
Holy smokes.
Look at you.
What's the occasion?
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?
Yeah.
I got a 8:00 dinner with one, and I got a 10:00 dinner with the other.
That's great.
Did you get that rash you always get before you go out?
- No.
Why did you remind me?
- Just trying to help.
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?
I wanted to check in, see when you thought you might get your own place.
I know we get along great, and Charlie loves you... but we are newlyweds so I thought you might...
Do you know how hard it is to find a rent-controlled place in the city?
Why do I have to be the one to move?
One, the lease is in my name, and, two, I found the apartment.
'Cause a 90-year-old woman died on your shift at the hospital.
Her body wasn't even cold before you were calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.
I didn't hear you complaining.
As a matter of fact, you went to her funeral.
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean like you.
You can't kick me out.
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.
I'm just saying maybe you should start looking, that's all.
- I hate you!
I really do.
- Hey, hey!
Hey!
I can hear you guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?
- I wasn't yelling.
She was yelling.
- I was.
I hate him!
- Why?
What did he do now?
- Me?
- That's a little presumptuous, don't you think?
- He's kicking me out.
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.
We'll get our own place once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.
- Until then, it's fine.
I actually kind oflike it.
- You do?
Yeah.
It's fun.
I love living with the both of you.
- What's wrong?
- Shit.
She has a couple of dates tonight...
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.
Hey.
I think...
I don't know if you remember me...
- but I think you drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida... and when you refer to Ginger's companion... you're not talking about sushi or wasabi.
Not bad.
- Where's that funny accent of yours from?
- Oh... a funny place called Scotland.
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.
- Hmm.
How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.
I've had two auditions so far.
The first one was for the lead in a tampon spot... the role of the tampon, of course... and then, uh, the second one was a voice-over... for a pest-control infomercial.
And I didn't get that part.
They, uh...
They said that they thought roaches didn't have accents.
I begged to differ, but I didn't want to seem argumentative.
Hmm.
Don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say?
I am a mess.
You don't look like a mess.
You look as cute as a button.
And buttons aren't messy.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
You know, back home in Scotland, I was captain of the local football team.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
And all my mates used to come to me with their problems.
They said I was pretty good.
So...
I'm all ears if you want to talk to someone from the outside, you know?
Hmm.
That's sweet, but it would take all night to tackle my laundry list.
Thanks.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.
And I'm counting the minutes until I see you again.
- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.
We get paid to steal other people's lines.
See ya.
Uh, seriously, though...
Could I give you a lift home tonight?
I could come and fetch you about, say, just before midnight.
No charge.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.
With three olives and a tiny splash of vermouth.
- Okay.
- And just a hint... a hint... of salt on the rim.
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Tonight we have a braised lamb shank... marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.
That's served with a creamed pumpkin squash.
We also have a grilled halibut steak... in a soy-tamari lemon-zest glaze.
And that comes with grilled seaweed and an orange and almond salad.
Do we know what we'd like?
Yes.
I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin squash and the rosemary-lime sauce... and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.
Excellent.
Coming right up.
Conrad, I'm impressed.
You duked the guy.
I didn't know you had it in you.
There's a lot in me that you don't know about.
I'm a burnin'sex machine just waitin'to be used and abused by you.
The harder, the better.
Check, please.
...as much as I can, but it's not good.
- How?
- I don't know.
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.
So you love Capra... you run in the park, you tango... you live for Italy, and you hate asparagus.
Are you sure we weren't separated at birth?
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies... every Thursday since I was 15.
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.
Closed hand, deuces wild.
I love it when you talk dirty.
This is actually fun.
I have to admit.
I usually dread the whole first-date thing.
You know, the awkward lulls in the conversation.
Then the anxious pain in the pit of my stomach when I can't wait... for the night to end, but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.
Yeah, I'm feeling rather painless and "lull-less" myself.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
But, uh, I do want to be honest with you about something.
Oh, no.
Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.
See, I was so flattered with the way you asked me out in the elevator.
- I know.
Don't tell me.
You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married... but Stewart and I have been living together for years.
- Yeah.
- Stewart...
- Am I a moron or what?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- I can't help it.
I'm hopeless.
- You're not.
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.
All you need is some space... some fresh air and some perspective.
Fresh air, space and perspective in New York City.
Stick with me.
This is unbelievable.
Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah, it's one of the perks of the job.
I give Jimmy the doorman free rides... and he lets me come up here whenever I fancy.
I love this city.
Oh, me too.
You know, it's funny, 'cause sometimes, up here... everything is so tall and grand.
Even my biggest problems, you know... suddenly seem very wee.
Within seconds they just melt away like tiny dewdrops.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.
Ah, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist.
I've been wanting to do that... from the moment I saw your face in my rearview mirror.
What's wrong?
Oh, Christ.
Was it awful?
I-I'm a wee bit out of practice.
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.
Well, thank you.
Your lips seem... nice and supple too.
But I'm sensing that, uh... your heart's not doing the Riverdance thing that mine is.
Gordy, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- For what?
For being me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.
I happen to think you're pretty dandy.
So you're gay.
Big deal.
- How did you know?
- Just a feeling, I suppose.
That and the fact that you haven't shut up about Charlie all night.
And every time you mentioned her name you got that little... sparkle thing in your eyes.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.
That's easy.
You're gonna move on with your life... start being the person that you're supposed to be... instead of wasting your time pretending to be someone that you're not.
I mean, crikey.
Are you not exhausted?
I am, but it's so much easier to keep pretending.
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!
Isn't it?
As your newfound friend...
I am prescribing a remedy for you.
That's part of the remedy.
This is the remedy.
"I am woman.
Hear me roar."
Helen Reddy.
She'll sort you out.
There are a few things I'd like to know about you too.
All right.
What would you like to know?
Oh, just about anything.
Things you like.
Things you don't like.
Where you went to school.
Who was your first beau.
What you want out oflife.
- Mmm.
That's a tall order.
Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.
- Till the Clouds Roll By.
- I guess I like what everyone likes.
That's one of my favorite all-time movies.
I know every line and every step.
Me too.
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thank you.
No.
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.
Will you dance with me?
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.
- Do you know this dance?
- Yeah.
What's goin' on?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.
Sorry.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?
She must be ovulating.
I heard that.
Huh?
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?
Mmm.
She's the best.
Strong, independent, feisty.
- Who are you talking about?
- Who else?
Queen Oprah.
Oprah.
Oprah the Great.
Oprah...
I love her.
Do you understand that I'm obsessed with her?
Like, I think she is so great that she should start her own religion.
I love her so much that if she and Steadman... couldn't have children and needed a little bit of help...
I would surrogate a child for them.
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.
Wow.
That's a lot of love.
Last night I was so inspired after watching her show about loving your body that...
- Do you know what I did today?
- What?
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!
Yeah!
Can you believe it?
I quit.
Fergie, "smergie."
I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.
And if Dereck isn't going to love me for the tiny amount... of cellulite I have on the back of my thighs...
- then fuck him...
Screw that guy.
- Yeah.
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Hot!
- Thank you.
I mean, why does our society push us... to be perpetually uncomfortable with who we are?
It's so messed up.
You wanna know why?
Here.
This is why.
"Boost your buttocks in five days."
"Luscious liposuction." "The flawless face-lift."
That's why.
Enough is enough.
We need to stop letting society and-and media... and our religious leaders delegate who we are.
You're amazing, and I'm even more amazing... and anybody who doesn't get it can go screw themselves!
That felt fantastic.
Spewing is a wonderful thing.
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.
That's what they should have.
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.
What are you doing here?
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.
This better be good.
I'm about to get prepped for surgery.
What is it?
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.
Maybe you should just get prepped for surgery...
Maybe you should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.
Gray.
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.
It's really major, and I don't know how to say it.
- Why don't you take three short breaths and one...
- One long.
- I'm gay.
- What?
- As in Marvin.
- What?
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray," and...
Bingo!
Oh.
- That's great.
- What about it is great?
- It's great that you're coming out.
- Don't tell me you knew.
Gray, of course I knew.
How can you know when I didn't even know?
I'm smarter than you.
I've known since second grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?
Tell you, I'm proud of you, Gray.
- This is a big moment.
This is huge.
- It's big, all right... but there's one other thing I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.
Bigger.
Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.
- Well, I guess it depends on how you see it.
- What is it?
- I'm in love with her.
- Who?
- Her.
- Who her?
- Your wife.
- Whose wife?
Yours.
I'm in love with Charlie.
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would never joke about it.
I love the way she talked and walked and looked and felt... but it really kicked in after we kissed.
Kissed?
What do you mean, kissed?
Are you saying you kissed my wife?
Only once, and technically she wasn't your wife.
It was the night before your wedding.
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.
Just tell me off.
Just yell at me.
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
Gray, I want you to pack up your shit and get it out of the apartment... by the time I get home tonight, because we're done.
All right?
We're done.
There has to be a reason.
Why would she move out without talking to us about it... or even telling us where she was going?
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?
It's not supposed to mean anything.
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.
Aren't you happy we'll have the place to ourselves?
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?
Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- What aren't you telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird.
You love your sister.
Yes, I love my sister.
How about you?
Do you love my sister?
Of course I love your sister.
I think she's great.
"Great." How great?
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You know what?
I'm late.
I gotta go, okay?
I'll see you later.
Sam?
So as you can see, the consumers love to think of nothing but C-Pro.
- B-Pro.
- What?
- B-Pro.
You said "C-Pro."
- I did?
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass of water.
Take your time.
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.
Gray, hang in there.
You're doing just fine.
- No, I'm not doing fine.
I'm the Titanic.
- No!
- Yes.
- You just gotta...
You gotta get focused.
You gotta center yourself, and you gotta march back in there... and you show them who's the boss.
Who's the Boss?
I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light had really weird hair, but...
Gray!
You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?
You gotta get out of your head and get into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Center yourself.
- And go.
- Go.
Go.
Gimme a "P. "Gimme an "R. "
Gimme an "O."
What's that spell?
B-Pro!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Lana, what the hell are you doing?
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative executive on the Bartlett account... because I thought it would be best to show Julia two perspectives.
- You mean the one of her tits and the one of her ass?
- Gray!
I'm sure that Lana has 36 double-D ideas... for the account, and I'll just give you your privacy to fondle through them.
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.
I'm sure it cost me my job.
Well, with copy like that, they should be begging you to stay.
Here.
Drink that while it's still hot.
That, young lady, is my granny's secret recipe.
Mmm!
This is so good.
What's in this?
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey and a wee bit of nutmeg.
Gordy,you are amazing.
You barely know me and you're such a great friend.
You're gonna make some lucky girl very happy one day.
So are you.
God, everything is so complicated.
If it was 30 years ago, I could just move away and join a convent.
Those outfits are so hideous.
You know, if you want my advice... and I don't suppose you do, but I'm going to give it to you anyway.
- I think you have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?
You have to tell her the truth.
- I can't do that.
- Yes,you can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I mean, for all you know, she might feel the same way about you.
Come on.
Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.
But you won't know that until you talk to her.
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?
What if you go through your entire life saying, "What if?"
What happens if she does feel the same way?
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.
- He doesn't talk to you now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.
And do you foresee that ever changing?
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm.
Just drink your tea.
This is so good.
Are you sure this is just tea, nutmeg and honey?
Wee bit of whiskey.
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!
What kind of shortbread is this?
Mmm, short.
God, they're so beautiful and magical and peaceful.
Will they have babies here?
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality among mammals.
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales... but did you know that over 50% of elephants are gay?
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People... over loudspeakers and watch their feet.
I'm kidding.
So where've you been hiding?
I've left three messages and no answer, and Sam won't say a word.
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.
Anything you want to talk about?
Do you remember that night we spent together in Las Vegas before you got married to Sam?
Barely.
I mean, I remember having a great time... but I think you got me too drunk to remember anything else.
Why?
Did I say something really stupid?
- It's not what you said.
- God.
What did I do?
I don't know if you did anything.
It might have just been me.
- Oh, my God.
I remember.
- You do?
- Yes.
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.
How could you let your brother marry me?
I didn't know if you were conscious of what was going on.
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?
I sounded like a cat in heat, didn't I?
Is that what you think we're talking about?
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?
- No.
That was it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.
Did you try to convince Sam not to marry me?
There was no convincing him.
Trust me.
If I could have, I would have.
You know, every morning I wake up before Sam does... and I just watch him.
I just lie there and stare.
And I love the way his nose wrinkles when he's dreaming... and the little purring sound that he makes when he's about to wake up.
And the way that he keeps his hand on my thigh the whole night... just to let me know that he's there.
And I know it may seem crazy... but love is crazy, isn't it?
It sure is.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?
You're so lucky.
I never had a brother or sister.
Oh!
I don't know what's going on between the two of you... but you have to work it out, Sam.
Just talk to her.
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah.
Gray.
Seems Julia wasn't thrilled with the way our last presentation went.
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated or patronized anymore.
- Actually, I was gonna give you a promotion, but...
- What?
I asked Jordan to make you the executive creative director on my account... and to give you free rein to do whatever you want.
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea was yours.
I think you have great ideas.
You just haven't been given the freedom to explore them fully.
I like your energy, your spunk, your candidness... and I think with the right support... you're gonna give me exactly what I'm looking for.
Wow!
- I don't know what to say.
- Sorry to interrupt, Gray... but your 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics is in the small conference room.
Oh, I don't have a 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics.
They said they confirmed it with your office.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.
Isn't she adorable?
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't have you in my book.
Hey.
See,you forgot your toothbrush... and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard, part soft bristles... must be hard to come by.
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?
And to say I'm sorry.
I overreacted...
Little bit.
Not a lot.
Little bit.
After all, you have to admit... it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...
I'm not quite sure why I got so surprised... 'cause if you think about it... it's almost inevitable that you and I would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?
You're acting...
You're acting very rational.
It's too rational.
You used to do this when we were kids.
Then I'd turn around and you'd tackle me.
I should be getting my knees in the lock-down position.
You know, Gray...
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.
You know that, right?
Being without you I feel like one half of me is missing.
Lately I've been feeling very lopsided.
- Oh, Sam.
- Just 'cause you're totally gay... and in love with my wife doesn't mean we can't work things out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.
Now, this is good.
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!
- Oh, my...
- Gray!
Gray!
Gray!
How ya doin'?
How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.
Put your eyes back in your heads.
Hey, what...
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.
- I never wanna see another human being ever again.
- No.
Look.
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad...
Who cares what those people think?
I care.
They're probably calling Jerry Springer right now as we speak.
No.
No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For having to be related to me.
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel...
Gray, look.
You're just...
You're just coming out, okay?
- I am never coming out of this elevator.
- This is probably... the biggest revelation of your entire life.
It's normal to be going nuts.
- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.
I don't feel any of those things.
Well, how do you feel?
- Lonely.
- Why?
Because I'm never gonna be able to walk down the street... holding hands with my partner... without the rest of the world giving us a look.
I may never have the wedding that I once dreamed of... and I may never have children... and one day, when I die... people will never give as much respect to my grieving lover... as if she were my husband.
Gray... it's not as if you made a choice.
That's what terrifies me.
It's so much easier to be someone else.
Do you remember when we were kids... you would have been about six... and Dad came home to tell Mom he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.
Yeah.
Remember we stayed in the closet all night... just cuddled up like two little mice and... listened to their whole fight.
I was... so angry.
I was... hurt.
I was just...
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there and kick his ass...
- and you remember what you said to me?
- Hmm.
You were just six... but you said it was gonna be okay... that Dad was not gonna live a lie... that he was gonna try and be happy... and that everyone deserved to be happy.
I said that?
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.
Why are you being so nice to me?
- You should hate me.
- For what?
For having good taste?
You never have to worry about it.
I mean, she's completely, madly, passionately... like cow-jump-over-the-moon in love with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great... for me.
Not so great for you.
But you're not gonna make me feel guilty for this are you?
Mm-mmm.
Gray, you know what?
You can't expect the first girl that you fall in love with... to love you back.
That's...
That's not how it works.
That would be the equivalent of settling down when you were age 12.
You haven't gone through gay puberty yet.
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?
- No.
Of the elevator.
- Of the elevator.
I should have broken up with Dereck ages ago.
I am having the best time.
- So what about you?
Have you met anyone yet?
- Not yet.
Really?
Girls should be lining up around the block for you.
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?
It depends, I guess.
- Funny.
You need funny.
- Funny would be good.
- And stylish.
No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.
And for the love of God, don't wind up... with one of those ladies who doesn't believe in waxing.
- You're killing me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
- Have you ever been attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
- Not even a little?
- No.
- Huh.
Oh.
Not even last year, when I was in shape after taking those Pilates classes?
Or last week when I wore that pink Marc Jacobs dress to work... and you told me how cute I looked?
You looked so cute.
You are cute, but, you know, not cute that way, cute.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's so depressing.
It's not like I'm into girls, but if I was a girl who was into girls...
I'd definitely be into me, 'cause I think I'm a catch.
You are a catch, but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.
Hmm.
But you said you don't have a type.
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.
Wait.
Don't you usually have therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?
Oh, my God.
I'm so late.
Shoot.
Okay.
You know, I don't really want to go, so watch this.
Sydney, it's Gray.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't wanna go to the batting cages... and I don't wanna go rock climbing or bowling or anywhere with you... 'cause I'm feeling really good about myself... and I don't think you're a very good therapist for me, so you're fired.
Thank you, and have a nice day.
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?
That was amazing.
Do you want to get a mani-pedi before we go back to work?
- Sure.
I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.
What if I dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?
- Yes.
- Really?
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!
I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?
Because you're gay, and you have to start behaving' like it.
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?
No, but you haven't had sex with a woman yet... and, you know, that's like being black... and never having listened to the Jackson Five... or being Jewish and never having a knish... or being Indian and never having had a curry or being...
Or being Scottish and not keeping your mouth shut?
- I suppose so.
Come on.
- Hi.
Sorry.
No men allowed.
Wh...
Isn't that against the law?
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.
- No exceptions.
No men.
- Forget it.
Well, just go in by yourself.
I can't go in by myself.
Are you kidding?
I have an idea.
I would like an Apricot Sour, please.
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.
And a touch of lemon and a squeeze of lime.
And a little bit of sugar on the rim.
Comin' up.
Apricot Sour?
I thought that was what you women drank, for Christ's sakes.
- One of your eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.
Hi.
Can I buy you a drink?
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.
See, but thanks.
You don't?
Shut up.
This is quite tasty, actually.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.
Hey, give it a minute.
Oh, my God.
It's Julia Bartlett.
- Quick, quick.
I gotta get out of here.
- Why?
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello.
Is there anybody in?
No.
Her?
You think?
Gray, did your mom ever tell you... what your I.Q. scores were?
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.
I'm just taking a break from working on your account.
Gray, I didn't come over here to check up on you.
Um, hello.
Uh, my name's Georgette.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
And, uh, lovely.
And I'm just gonna leave you two to, uh... to, uh... to catch up on everything.
- Mmm.
Lovely.
- Don't go.
Yeah, it was lovely to see you too.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Dutch way...
Three kisses.
So, uh...
Fine.
It's fine.
I'm fine.
You're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, and I've got to go now.
Bye.
You really surprised me the other day.
I had no idea you were gay.
That makes two of us.
You're not just coming out, are you?
Put it this way.
My hotel's been closed for a long time... but tonight's the grand opening.
There have been a few fake openings... but tonight's the real deal.
I...
No, I don't understand.
Yes, I'm just coming out.
I don't think anyone in here will mind.
You really are adorable.
I always thought so.
Really?
From day one, in that little cream, pin-striped suit you were wearing.
I like that suit too.
I think I got it at, uh, Banana Republic.
Or maybe it was, uh, Emporio Armani.
Actually, it could have been Barneys, but the shirt was from Bloomies.
Listen.
I have this beautiful bottle of cognac... that I just brought back from France, and I would...
- I'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?
No.
My place.
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.
Uh, okay, well...
I like cognac.
I like cognac.
I like brandy too.
Usually I have a little cognac with a splash of brandy on the side.
I have brandy too.
- Give it up.
You're toast.
- You're gonna eat those words.
Come on, Gray!
Come on!

- [Man] Hey.
- Help!
- Okay.
- Help.
Ohh.
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?
- Yeah.
Mmm.
- What do you got?
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.
- And chicken.
- Good.
- And fish.
- And fish.
- And tofu.
- Good.
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great.
We got tempeh.
Then I got the regular essentials, like asparagus and lettuce.
- [Phone Rings]
- I got it.
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay?
Let's...
Hello?
Hey, Carrie.
Who?
Yeah, she's right here.
Hey, honey.
- Dinner?
No.
We just rented a DVD.
- Raging Bull.
- We go out.
I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.
Do you want something fruity or full-bodied and do...
Okay.
Okay.
What...
Californian, French, Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span...
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have to yell.
[Chattering]
- [Man] Ohh!
- Oh, my God.
That is amazing.
Oh, my God.
Carrie.
Do you believe this?
Ta-da!
[Chattering]
I would like to say something.
To Carrie and Dereck and their lovely friends.
[Speaking Italian]
[Woman] Oh, my goodness.
I don't know what it means, but it sounded beautiful.
- It's a fake accent.
He's from Poughkeepsie.
- God, he is adorable.
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?
- I don't think he plays on your team.
- But he's overweight.
And poofs are rarely beefy.
I wrote a piece about that in a magazine once.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Carrie, do you have the new Liza Minnelli CD?
- Mmm.
Okay, and scratch my last comment.
Cheers.
- Cheers.
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.
- Oh, uh, more for you,yeah?
- Yes.
- Red or white?
- I'll have red.
Actually, I'll have white.
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.
- All right.
- Um, well, Julia Bartlett is not an easygoing client.
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account, I'd pull my hair out.
Oh, honey.
- Doesn't mean you're getting a promotion before me.
- [Chuckles]
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what do you do?
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency at Mount Sinai Hospital... with a specialty in, uh...
[Imitates Heartbeat] heart transplants.
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.
And how long have you two been together?
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thirty years.
- [Laughing]
- I'm sorry.
Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?
- No.
- Gray's my sister.
Oh, my God!
No!
Ick!
No, I'm...
I just...
I thought that you two were an item.
Well, I just...
- What?
These-These two?
- Well, yeah.
You seem so...
So?
I don't know.
So together, I guess.
Hey, what'd I miss?
- Um, she thinks we're together.
- [Gray] Like "together" together?
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!
You're not the first one to think that, Elaine.
- Let me tell you.
- What?
- They're very codependent.
- [Together] We are not!
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart.
But if that's...
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.
How about that...
Remember?
You want to know something?
I've even seen them share the same toothbrush.
- [Together] One time.
- Oh, ick.
- One time is... it's creepy.
- I...
Listen.
I think that your relationship is charming.
- Thank you.
- Have you ever French-kissed?
[Laughing] That's beautiful.
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?
You know, the sisters that were 103 and 105, and they never got married... and they just did yoga and headstands together every day.
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.
- I'm serious.
We need to venture out.
- To where?
When?
I'm too busy to date, and I'm not goin' to bars.
The girls there, all they do is they talk about how fat they are.
They're not fat.
They're not fat girls.
They're thin girls that think they're fat.
You know what I want?
I want a girl who's not afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay... and have no guilt attached, that's what I want.
Can't you meet a cute intern at the hospital?
[Imitates Buzzer] Wrong.
Can't do it.
Too dangerous.
You can't have sexual tension and cut an artery.
It's awkward.
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl for you, and you look for a guy for me...
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers is one of the Spice Girls.
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider going to Florida traveling.
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.
[Groans]
Somebody who doesn't think Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.
Someone who would call me an hour after our first date and say...
"I am crazy about you, and I'm counting the minutes until I could see you again."
[Sighs]
[With Scots Accent] That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.
Eatin' with your fingers, things.
It's quite festive.
[Laughing]
Hey, Jimmy.
Happy birthday!
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.
Oh, sorry about that.
Hey, Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
My Weight Watchers meeting went over, and it was too good to leave.
Why do you still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.
He has nerve.
He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?
- Did you tell him to go to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know.
Right?
But trust me.
The entertainment factor alone is worth it.
Today, it was so crazy.
There was this woman who was all mad at her husband for not letting her have dessert.
So she breaks into the Soho Chocolate Factory... and tried to drown herself in a vat of chocolate.
- No.
- Yes.
- Like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka?
- Exactly.
It's like the cuckoo show.
Ooh, let's see who's in Page Six today.
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes... with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds like a crossing guard wrote it.
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.
- It's so cool and kitsch.
Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana?
Don't listen to Lana.
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?
I do think she does a lot more than just type for him.
- Give it up.
- Okay.
You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.
- Yeah.
- Lana...
Wait, I feel like somebody's listening...
Lana goes to Kemiko, my pedicurist... and told her, who then told Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...
- she and Mr. Phillips have been seeing each other for months.
- No!
I know it's accurate gossip 'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!
Hey!
What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me to do some research for him, so...
Oh, really?
Oh, that's too bad.
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
- Bye.
[Whispering] Research my ass.
You mean her ass.

# [Synthesized]

[Woman's Voice] B-Pro.
- # [Ends]
- The campaign...
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.
- [Beeps]
- It's on, sir.
Carry on, Gray.
The campaign exudes nostalgia, comedy... thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion all under one banner.
It'll appeal to a wide demographic and leads the consumer... with an emotional end benefit of feeling charged up.
To challenge themselves and seize the day and be the best they can be.
Whoo!
- [Mouthing Words]
- Well, Julia?
And I must say you look fantastic.
What do you think?
Great, no?
No.
- N-N-No?
- No.
Well, it's, uh... it's just an initial proposal.
I mean, it still needs to be tweaked and tuned.
You only tweak or tune if something has potential.
Uh, we'll, uh... we'll go back to the drawing board then, that's all.
Why don't you call me when you have something original to present?
Julia, I'm sure we have a bunch of...
Shut that thing off.
I'm sure we have a bunch of things.
This is just one of them.
What's wrong with you?
That was crap.
J...
Julia, just a second.
I don't know, Sydney.
I don't know if this kind of therapy is working for me.
How come every road I take turns out to be a dead end?
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.
At least with a fork there's a choice...
right or left or east or west...
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.
Why do you think you always reach these dead ends?
Ooh!
You see, gutter ball.
That's my life... a bunch of gutter balls.
Well, this is a perfect example... of why having therapy in different locations is so important.
Look at the deep symbolism in that gutter ball.
No, this is good.
This is very, very good.
Can you think of one word that best describes...
- the way your work situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?
- No, one.
- Um...
Ohh!
Frustrated.
- You're up.
- Right.
Okay, another word... for how you really feel when your brother wins all your races.
- Frustrated.
- Okay.
Another word for how you feel when you think about going on a date.
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.
I know.
But I can't help it.
It's a weird thing, but I see myself as this charming hotel... that's beautifully romantic and... wonderful on the outside... but on the inside, it just needs a ton of renovations.
Hence, closed for repairs.
Nice analogy.
What kinds of renovations?
Getting a promotion at work, perfecting the tango... disowning my mother, getting liposuction under my chin.
There's nothing worse than chin fat.
Uh, I think you need to... let the idea of sharing your life with someone other than your brother... enter your consciousness.
But how can I be conscious of something that I'm unconscious of?
It's not like I don't date.
I've had plenty of boyfriends.
Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.
Let's try something.
How about keeping the hotel closed... but keeping the veranda open for cocktails?
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front...
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out of time today... but we will resume this conversation next week at the rock climbing wall.
Nice game.
And what happened to going to a movie?
How are you going to meet anyone in a dark movie theater?
How are you going to meet anyone at a dog park?
Hello?
The dog park is a vortex for singles.
Hello?
When did we become dog owners?
- [Barking]
- No.
[Panting]
I wash my hand of this whole fiasco.
You're on your own.
Ow!
Grabbing.
- Check out center field.
- What about cen...
Ahh!
Ohh!
Yes!
Holy... smokes.
I'll do the preinterview.
If she's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"
- and you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball."
- What?
- There's no way she's single.
- Do what I say.
- You know what?
Don't get bossy.
- Ow!
Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt.
Spazzy men are not attractive.
Some spazzy men are attractive.
- Gosh.
You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.
- Or should I say 21 ?
- She's legal.
Yeah.
I suppose I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?
Maybe a liver martini with a beef jerky twist?
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.
Originally Charlotte, but it always seemed too long and never quite suited me, so...
I'm Gray.
You can't really shorten that or it'd be "Gra."
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.
- Dancing?
Are you athletic?
- Uh...
- Do you watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well...
Do you have a boyfriend?
What is your favorite dessert?
[Chuckles] Okay.
Um, uh...
Let's see.
I'm a 1940s movie buff.
I love to swing dance.
I've never been very good at sports... um, love the Discovery Channel, "nix-ay" on the boyfriend... and, well, it's kind of a toss-up.
I-I like cheesecake, but I kind of love... those big, gooey hot fudge sundaes, so...
[Laughing] Get the ball.
[Gray Chuckling]
[Chuckles]
Who's that?
Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute.
What's his name?
- Fluffy.
- Suki.
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.
Oh, well, you are so adorable.
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.
He's one...
He's one-five.
He's 15.
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.
Sam.
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people... that illegally keeps endangered animals in their apartment, like that guy... that got caught with a leopard in his kitchen?
No.
I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at New York Aquarium.
- Ha!
That's a relief.
- Free Willy is my favorite movie.
Well, Free Willy 1, 2 and 3.
It's hard to pick a favorite.
And Jaws.
Finding Nemo.
Orca.
Orca not so much.
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.
I'm staying on a friend's sofa for right now.
I just moved here from San Francisco about three weeks ago.
- I love San Francisco.
- Really?
Have you spent much time there?
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.
I know I've never been to San Francisco, but I know I would love it.
Tony Bennett loves it.
He left his heart there.
I love Tony Bennett.
There you go.
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?
Yeah.
You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons, 'cause we love that dog.
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny.
Gypsy's not mine either.
I dog walk on the side for extra cash.
I should probably get her back, so...
Oh.
It was really nice to meet you both.
- Nice meeting you both...
You.
- Nice meeting you.
- What are you waiting for?
- What?
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.
All right.
Uh, excuse me!
Since you're new in town, if you're not doing anything tonight, maybe you'd join us?
We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine, if you'd like to join us.
I just said that.
Would you like to join us?
Three times.
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Okay.

Carlos!
Cover me!
I'm goin' in.
Okay, best food movie.
- Like Water For Chocolate.
- Babette's Feast.
How about Babette's Feast?
- Okay.
- Okay, Fatso starring Dom DeLuise.
- Yes.
- Oh, good one.
Okay, is it me?
Let's see.
Uh, women you need to get away from.
Bette Davis in What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?
Ah, good one.
I got Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction for the rabbit.
- Kathy Bates in Misery.
- Okay.
Okay.
How 'bout, um, best screen kiss?
- Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind.
- That's overrated, I think.
I'll go with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in Notorious.
Okay.
I'll see your Notorious... and I'll raise you Omar Sharif and Julie Christie in Doctor Zhivago.
- Very good.
- Oh, wait.
I'll see your Doctor Zhivago... and I will raise you Lady and the Tramp in Lady and the Tramp.
Winner.
Winner.
The spaghetti pooch smooch.
Nothing better.
Thank God we're home.
My toes are even starting to swell.
I'm exhausted.
Dogs are barking?
No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.
I'm wide awake.
I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.
- Oh, yeah?
Me too.
You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.
Let's go to Soho House or Sway or like a diner or something.
- [Foot Stomps]
- Ow.
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?
Big meeting in the morning you have to get to?
Oh, that big meeting.
Actually, I'm pretty tired.
I should go to bed.
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay.
Good night.
I hope we can do this again.
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.
Night.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You got in late last night.
I didn't even hear you come in.
- I'm just getting in now.
- Sounds like you had a good time.
- It was more than good.
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.
Don't blow it.
You're off to a strong start, but a girl can sense a "glommer."
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes.
Glommer.
- I know.
I...
Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy...
- I know she doesn't...
- She could think you're a glommer and you don't know.
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.
What?
And she said yes.
[Chuckles] Can you believe it?
We got our blood work done this morning, and we're going to Vegas this weekend...
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?
I know.
It's amazing.
It's like...
It's...
It's...
It's...
It's incredible.
You know what she is?
She's...
She's the sun, she's the stars, she's the moon.
She's the jackpot.
She's it.
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.
You know what she isn't?
An ax murderer.
You know what she is?
Perfect.
She's perfect.
Gray, remember what Mom always used to say?
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me.
It's right.
Mom is divorced for the third time, and she lives in a commune.
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."
I'm not jealous of you when you're totally psychologically unstable.
I'm psychologically unstable?
I'm psyc...
You're the one that said "Get the ball."
I said "Get the ball," not "Get the ring."
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend, and we are gonna get married.
You can come with us.
I booked you a room.
I booked you a flight.
If you come, great.
And if you don't, that's your deal.
- But you know what?
I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?
One minute you know someone, the next minute they're so desperate...
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.
I told Charlie that you'd meet her at Bloomingdale's tomorrow to try on wedding dresses.
She doesn't have a lot of friends in the city, and I thought it'd be fun for you two.
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.
If you want sexy, I got sexy.
I mean, I know you kids aren't Little Bo Peep underneath those dresses.
- [Slurping]
- But... if you ask me... a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.
A beautiful bride, yes.
A glowing bride, of course.
But sexy is...
I...
I just don't know.
Personally, it makes me a little uncomfortable.
Really?
Do you have anything in red with a slit up to the hip?
- Red!
- She's kidding.
Just something with a little less piff and poof and no lace.
Oh, no lace?
No problem.
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin... that is to die for.
Great.
Are you sure you want to go through with this?
Did you know that Sam cheats at Monopoly and he snores?
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I work with animals.
Hairy is a turn-on.
Honestly?
I was a goner the moment I saw him at the dog park.
There's just something about his impish smile and that twinkle in his eye.
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out of this thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.
Set them free.
Please tell me you don't wear stuff like that every day.
What?
Lingerie?
I love it.
I've spent more on lingerie than I have on rent.
I haven't bought a new pair of underwear in over four years.
- [Slurping] - [Chuckles]
- Eww.
That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don't you try a dress on?
- No.
- Come on.
This one's only 10,000.
No way, no way.
Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.
Come on.
It will be fun.
Try it on.
Forget about it.
No way.
Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.
No!
What if I damage it?
Shh.
Stay still while I get this zipper up.
[Gasps]
Ohh!
Did you cover me?
I was at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?
Yep.
But I told him you were at the gynecologist getting a pap smear.
It shut him up.
- Good one.
- So what were you doing at the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.
- No!
- Sorry.
I've been reading too many trashy magazines.
What?
He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.
- No.
- Yes!
The wedding is this weekend.
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.
The worst thing is, I can't think of a reason why he shouldn't marry her.
She's smart.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
She's amazing.
Oh, please!
She's a gold-digging wench trying to hook her little claws into a resident surgeon... before he makes the big bucks that she can later get her hands on... in an ugly, ugly, ugly divorce settlement... that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping on the side, will handle.
You're not still taping All My Children every day?
I TiVo it.
But seriously, you must be flipping out that Sam is getting married... leaving you all alone, completely single... with no real prospects in the future?
That's horrible.
I feel so bad for you.
Promise me if I ever call you when I'm suicidal, you'll refer the call.
Sure.
Here you go.
Can I get some change?
Kidding.
Don't spend it all on the slots.
Red 21.
This place is...
This is awesome.
[Chuckles]
Check this out.
This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?
It's a satin-cotton blend.
Possibly Egyptian cotton if this is the high-roller room.
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.
'Cause you're not doin' any high rollin' in this bed till tomorrow.
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.
You're not supposed to see the bride until tomorrow morning.
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall that you booked for me.
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.
Besides, we haven't been apart in six whole days.
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.
What are you guys...
What are you guys gonna do without me?
- None of your business.
See you at the chapel.
- Ow!
Violent.
You're gonna get socked.
Ow!
Ow!
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.
- Ninja claw!
Ohh!
- Hey!
[Laughs]
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane.
We have to take a bath.
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.
- Exactly.
- Right.
I'll order two bottles.
Ta-da!
[Laughs] I hope you didn't greet the room service guy like that.
Hmm.
Is that why he said he didn't need a tip?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Please tell me you work out three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.
- Never been to a gym, and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hate you.
If I told you I had acne until I was 21, would that make you feel better?
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.
My nickname was "Connect the Dots."
[Both Laughing]
I have a toast.
To my soon-to-be sister-in-law and my newfound friend...
That's a bathing suit you're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, are you?
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good since I was 17.
I'm not taking off a thing.
- I have a secret I want to share, but I don't know if I should.
- You should.
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.
Though I did get kicked out of the Brownies for stealing money out of my cookie account.
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.
Relations as in intercourse.
I decided to wait, and I don't know if that was a mistake.
I mean, what if he's too big or if I'm too small or...
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you to test drive a car before you buy it?
[Laughs]
[Cheering, Applause]
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Well...
I love Vegas, and I am certain that Vegas loves me... because I lost a bundle on the slots last night.
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know.
I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.
For my next number, I'd like to give a warm welcome to my surprise guest... the delightful and charming Miss Charlie Kelsey.
Yeah!
- You didn't.
- Did.
- You didn't!
- Did.
- Why?
- Ooh!
Come on, honey.
How are you feeling this evening, Charlie?
Like I could throw up at any minute.
Well, that doesn't sound too pleasant.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean because of you.
I...
Can I just sit down, please?
Not too fast.
Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble... to hear you sing a number with me tonight.
#Twelve # There, I sang a number.
I'm going home.
- Come on, girlfriend.
I think we can do this.

[Gray] I can't believe I lost that much money.
Don't tell Sam.
- He liked you too.
- Why did that...
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.
Ah.
My wedding shoes.
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.
- Can't.
- Oh, God.
- All right.
I'll help you.
- Mmm!
Sleeping.
[Sighs]
Oh.
Here.
Here's a shirt.
Do you think the woman was mad... when I asked to see her husband's tattoo on his tush?
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.
I still don't know if it was a ship or a... a bunny.
Did I tell you how happy I am you're gonna be my sister-in-law?
- About 17 times.
- Well, I mean it.
[Moaning]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
[Spitting]
I can't believe that just happened.
How can this be happening?
You're marrying my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.
[Exhales] Oh, this can't be happening.
This is just a mistake.
A meaningless, too-much-tequila mistake.
Oh, my God!
[Buzzing]
- [Stops] - [Groans]
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.
You're already dressed?
[Groans]
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?
Don't you think we should talk?
Okay.
Can we talk while I get ready?
- Yeah.
Sure.
I guess.
- Great.
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.
- Are you really upset?
- Yeah.
I would be too if it were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.
I know it was one of those crazy, spontaneous moments... but don't you feel weird at all?
Not really.
I mean, I know it may seem strange...
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural.
I feel subnatural.
- [Gargling]
- In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.
But if I phone home, Sam would answer, and that wouldn't be good.
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?
Gray, come on.
Sit down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Anyone would tell you the exact same thing.
It is 100% normal to be feeling upset, sad, freaked out.
In fact, considering everything...
I think you're handling the whole thing really well.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
Your brother is getting married... and deep down inside you feel like you're losing him.
That's why you think I'm freaking out?
You think I'm having separation anxiety?
# [Organ]
# [Singing Gospel]
There's only one thing that can keep a marriage together... and that is love.

I look to the two of you with your bright smiles of devotion... and promise of commitment here in the very house of the Lord above!
# [Resumes]
- This place is nuts.
- But before I continue, I must ask... if there's anybody here who has any objection whatsoever... to the union of these two lovebirds.
[Hiccups]
I'm sorry.
Carry on.
Go ahead.
As I was saying... if there's anybody here who has an objection to the union... of these two love angels, speak their piece now.
[Hiccups]
Oh, my God!
Look out!
[Screams]
Your hiccups gone?
- Actually, yes.
- Good.
Great.
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.
- Right?
- Right.
Then by the power vested in me by the glorious state of Nevada...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.

Hi.

# [Continues]
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency.
Call me.
# [Continues]
-# [Fades] - [Sydney] Now reach to your right.
Station your left leg on the rock in the middle.
All right, Gray, what's really going on?
I canceled a session with someone today because you said it was an emergency.
- It is.
- Well, then?
Take a deep breath...
[Inhales]
- [Exhales]
- And tell me what's going on.
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...
- and there was something that was difficult to talk about.
- Fine.
Then do that.
- [Whispering] I think I'm gay.
- What was that?
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?
It's like this.
For years, I thought I was content being single... and I wasn't really interested in a relationship.
I thought that when Mr. Right came into my life, he just would.
He...
He wouldn't need some fancy invitation.
He would just arrive.
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right I'm waiting for.
It's Mrs. Right.
- Oh.
- And I think I found her.
And I kissed her...
[Sighs] and I think she kissed me back, but I'm not sure... 'cause I never kissed a girl before, and I'm not sure what the rules are.
But I know that I liked it.
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.
Why do you think you feel nauseous?
Do you think you committed some terrible sin just because you kissed a girl?
Why?
If you're two consenting adults, what's so terrible about that?
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.
Oh, so you believe you forced her to kiss you?
No.
No, not at all.
She kissed me.
- Okay, I'm confused now.
- So am I.
Y-You don't know what it's like.
One day you think you're one thing... and the next day you realize you're something else.
I feel like I'm Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
I'm in this new land and I want to get home... but something is telling me maybe this is my home.
Maybe I shouldn't click my heels three times.
Maybe I should just stay here and be nauseous with the Munchkins.
What scares you most about this whole thing?
That I'll lose Sam and he'll never talk to me again.
Well, why would Sam even care?
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset I kissed his wife.
- Whoa!
- [Gasps]
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God.
Y-You're looking pale.
Maybe you should take some deep breaths.
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not.
I'm a wreck.
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque, begging for forgiveness.
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.
I think we need to talk about this on level ground.
You're not thinking straight.
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?
No.
What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.
You were so jealous of Charlie... that you subconsciously tried to sabotage Sam's marriage.
Read my lips.
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling with feelings and emotions...
- and my heart's telling me...
- Actually, our time is up for today.
Now, forget about Sam and get out there and date.
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?
Now, I will see you next week at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.
Nice climb.
[Exhales]
My hotel is open.
I have suites, junior suites, deluxe accommodations available.
- Hey. [Chuckles]
- Hey.
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.
You know, actually, my grandfather once told me it's much nicer to say...
"That outfit looks very becoming on you."
- Well, thanks to you and your pops.
- [Laughs]
Whoa.
That coffee smells great.
I'm on this no-caffeine kick right now... but I still find myself hanging around Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.
[Chuckles] Actually, it's not all coffee.
It's one-third coffee, one-third cocoa, one-third chai... with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.
- Wow.
That's a new one. [Chuckles] - [Chuckles]
[Inaudible]
- What was that?
- Mmm...
Nothing.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
- Wow.
That...
That took guts.
- [Laughs]
Would you?
Sure.
What time?
- Um, Raoul's at 10:00.
- All right.
Well, I'll see you then.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Great.
Are you going up?
- Down.
- Okay.
See you tonight.
- Oh!
- Are-Are you okay?
- [Chuckles] - [Indistinct]
- Is anything sprained?
Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thank you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
[Sighs]
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, you know, I'm a pretty busy guy.
I'm usually booked up every night.
I'd have to...
I'd have to check my schedule.
- Yeah!
Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.
- [Sighs]
- Cool.
[Bell Dings]
[Sam] Hey, Gray.
Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?
Oh, you did some serious...
Oh!
Damage.
Holy smokes.
Look at you.
What's the occasion?
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?
Yeah.
I got a 8:00 dinner with one, and I got a 10:00 dinner with the other.
That's great.
Did you get that rash you always get before you go out?
- No.
Why did you remind me?
- Just trying to help.
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?
I wanted to check in, see when you thought you might get your own place.
I know we get along great, and Charlie loves you... but we are newlyweds so I thought you might...
[Clucks Tongue]
Do you know how hard it is to find a rent-controlled place in the city?
Why do I have to be the one to move?
One, the lease is in my name, and, two, I found the apartment.
'Cause a 90-year-old woman died on your shift at the hospital.
Her body wasn't even cold before you were calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.
I didn't hear you complaining.
As a matter of fact, you went to her funeral.
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean like you.
You can't kick me out.
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.
I'm just saying maybe you should start looking, that's all.
- I hate you!
I really do.
- Hey, hey!
Hey!
I can hear you guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?
- I wasn't yelling.
She was yelling.
- I was.
I hate him!
- Why?
What did he do now?
- Me?
- That's a little presumptuous, don't you think?
- He's kicking me out.
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.
We'll get our own place once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.
- Until then, it's fine.
I actually kind oflike it.
- You do?
Yeah.
It's fun.
I love living with the both of you.
- What's wrong?
- Shit.
[Chuckles]
She has a couple of dates tonight...
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.
Hey.
I think...
I don't know if you remember me...
- but I think you drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida... and when you refer to Ginger's companion... you're not talking about sushi or wasabi.
- Not bad.
- [Chuckles]
- Where's that funny accent of yours from?
- Oh... a funny place called Scotland.
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.
- Hmm.
How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.
I've had two auditions so far.
The first one was for the lead in a tampon spot... the role of the tampon, of course... and then, uh, the second one was a voice-over... for a pest-control infomercial.
And I didn't get that part.
They, uh...
They said that they thought roaches didn't have accents.
I begged to differ, but I didn't want to seem argumentative.
Hmm.
- [Sniffing]
- Don't worry.
I'm not contagious.
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say?
I am a mess.
You don't look like a mess.
You look as cute as a button.
And buttons aren't messy.
Well, looks can be deceiving.
You know, back home in Scotland, I was captain of the local football team.
- Oh?
- Yeah.
And all my mates used to come to me with their problems.
They said I was pretty good.
So...
I'm all ears if you want to talk to someone from the outside, you know?
Hmm.
That's sweet, but it would take all night to tackle my laundry list.
Thanks.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.
And I'm counting the minutes until I see you again.
- Hey, that's my line.
- I'm an actor.
We get paid to steal other people's lines.
See ya.
Uh, seriously, though...
Could I give you a lift home tonight?
I could come and fetch you about, say, just before midnight.
No charge.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.
With three olives and a tiny splash of vermouth.
- Okay.
- And just a hint... a hint... of salt on the rim.
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Tonight we have a braised lamb shank... marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.
That's served with a creamed pumpkin squash.
We also have a grilled halibut steak... in a soy-tamari lemon-zest glaze.
And that comes with grilled seaweed and an orange and almond salad.
Do we know what we'd like?
Yes.
I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin squash and the rosemary-lime sauce... and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.
Excellent.
Coming right up.
Conrad, I'm impressed.
You duked the guy.
I didn't know you had it in you.
There's a lot in me that you don't know about.
I'm a burnin'sex machine just waitin'to be used and abused by you.
The harder, the better.
- [Barks]
- Check, please.
...as much as I can, but it's not good.
- [Gray] How?
- I don't know.
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.
So you love Capra... you run in the park, you tango... you live for Italy, and you hate asparagus.
Are you sure we weren't separated at birth?
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies... every Thursday since I was 15.
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.
Closed hand, deuces wild.
I love it when you talk dirty.
This is actually fun.
I have to admit.
I usually dread the whole first-date thing.
You know, the awkward lulls in the conversation.
Then the anxious pain in the pit of my stomach when I can't wait... for the night to end, but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.
Yeah, I'm feeling rather painless and "lull-less" myself.
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.
But, uh, I do want to be honest with you about something.
Oh, no.
Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.
[Chuckles]
See, I was so flattered with the way you asked me out in the elevator.
- I know.
Don't tell me.
You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married... but Stewart and I have been living together for years.
- Yeah.
- Stewart...
- Am I a moron or what?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.
- I can't help it.
I'm hopeless.
- You're not.
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.
All you need is some space... some fresh air and some perspective.
Fresh air, space and perspective in New York City.
Stick with me.
[Gray] This is unbelievable.
[Cabdriver] Isn't this fantastic?
Yeah, it's one of the perks of the job.
I give Jimmy the doorman free rides... and he lets me come up here whenever I fancy.
[Inhales] I love this city.
- Oh, me too.
-[Laughs]
You know, it's funny, 'cause sometimes, up here... everything is so tall and grand.
Even my biggest problems, you know... suddenly seem very wee.
Within seconds they just melt away like tiny dewdrops.
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.
Ah, it's my pleasure.
Sorry.
I couldn't resist.
[Exhales] I've been wanting to do that... from the moment I saw your face in my rearview mirror.
What's wrong?
Oh, Christ.
Was it awful?
I-I'm a wee bit out of practice.
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.
- Well, thank you.
- [Laughs]
Your lips seem... nice and supple too.
But I'm sensing that, uh...
[Exhales] your heart's not doing the Riverdance thing that mine is.
Gordy, I'm sorry.
- Oh.
- For what?
For being me.
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.
I happen to think you're pretty dandy.
So you're gay.
Big deal.
- How did you know?
- Just a feeling, I suppose.
That and the fact that you haven't shut up about Charlie all night.
And every time you mentioned her name you got that little... sparkle thing in your eyes.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.
That's easy.
You're gonna move on with your life... start being the person that you're supposed to be... instead of wasting your time pretending to be someone that you're not.
I mean, crikey.
Are you not exhausted?
I am, but it's so much easier to keep pretending.
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!
Isn't it?
[Laughs]
As your newfound friend...
I am prescribing a remedy for you.
That's part of the remedy.
This is the remedy.
"I am woman.
Hear me roar."
Helen Reddy.
She'll sort you out.
[Laughs]
[Laughs]
[Man On TV] There are a few things I'd like to know about you too.
[Woman On TV] All right.
What would you like to know?
[Man] Oh, just about anything.
Things you like.
Things you don't like.
Where you went to school.
Who was your first beau.
What you want out oflife.
- Mmm.
That's a tall order.
Where shall I start?
- Oh, my God.
- Till the Clouds Roll By.
- I guess I like what everyone likes.
That's one of my favorite all-time movies.
I know every line and every step.
Me too.
# [Big Band]
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thank you.
No.
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.
Will you dance with me?
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.
- Do you know this dance?
- Yeah.
# [Big Band]

- [Door Opens]
- What's goin' on?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.
Sorry.
You okay?
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?
Nothing.
I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?
-# [Continues]
- She must be ovulating.
I heard that.
Huh?
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?
[Both Chuckling]
Mmm.
She's the best.
Strong, independent, feisty.
- Who are you talking about?
- Who else?
Queen Oprah.
Oprah.
Oprah the Great.
Oprah...
I love her.
Do you understand that I'm obsessed with her?
Like, I think she is so great that she should start her own religion.
I love her so much that if she and Steadman... couldn't have children and needed a little bit of help...
I would surrogate a child for them.
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.
Wow.
That's a lot of love.
Last night I was so inspired after watching her show about loving your body that...
- Do you know what I did today?
- What?
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!
Yeah!
Can you believe it?
I quit.
Fergie, "smergie."
I hate fiber.
I like Mallomars.
And if Dereck isn't going to love me for the tiny amount... of cellulite I have on the back of my thighs...
- then fuck him...
Screw that guy.
- Yeah.
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.
- Yes.
- Right?
- Hot!
- Thank you.
I mean, why does our society push us... to be perpetually uncomfortable with who we are?
It's so messed up.
You wanna know why?
Here.
This is why.
"Boost your buttocks in five days."
"Luscious liposuction." "The flawless face-lift."
That's why.
Enough is enough.
We need to stop letting society and-and media... and our religious leaders delegate who we are.
You're amazing, and I'm even more amazing... and anybody who doesn't get it can go screw themselves!
[Moans]
[Sighs] That felt fantastic.
Spewing is a wonderful thing.
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.
That's what they should have.
[Moans]
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.
What are you doing here?
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.
This better be good.
I'm about to get prepped for surgery.
What is it?
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.
Maybe you should just get prepped for surgery...
Maybe you should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.
Gray.
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.
It's really major, and I don't know how to say it.
- Why don't you take three short breaths and one...
- One long.
[Puffing]
- I'm gay.
- What?
- As in Marvin.
- What?
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray," and...
Bingo!
Oh.
- [Exhales] - [Exhales]
- That's great.
- What about it is great?
- It's great that you're coming out.
- Don't tell me you knew.
[Chuckling] Gray, of course I knew.
How can you know when I didn't even know?
I'm smarter than you.
I've known since second grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?
Tell you, I'm proud of you, Gray.
- This is a big moment.
This is huge.
- It's big, all right... but there's one other thing I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.
Bigger.
Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.
- Well, I guess it depends on how you see it.
- What is it?
- I'm in love with her.
- Who?
- Her.
- Who her?
- Your wife.
- Whose wife?
Yours.
I'm in love with Charlie.
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would never joke about it.
I love the way she talked and walked and looked and felt... but it really kicked in after we kissed.
Kissed?
What do you mean, kissed?
Are you saying you kissed my wife?
Only once, and technically she wasn't your wife.
It was the night before your wedding.
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.
Just tell me off.
Just yell at me.
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.
Gray, I want you to pack up your shit and get it out of the apartment... by the time I get home tonight, because we're done.
All right?
We're done.
[Charlie] There has to be a reason.
Why would she move out without talking to us about it... or even telling us where she was going?
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?
It's not supposed to mean anything.
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.
Aren't you happy we'll have the place to ourselves?
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?
Did you guys get in a fight or something?
- What aren't you telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird.
You love your sister.
Yes, I love my sister.
How about you?
Do you love my sister?
Of course I love your sister.
I think she's great.
"Great." How great?
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
You know what?
I'm late.
I gotta go, okay?
I'll see you later.
Sam?

So as you can see, the consumers love to think of nothing but C-Pro.
- B-Pro.
- What?
- B-Pro.
You said "C-Pro."
- I did?
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass of water.
Take your time.
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.
- [Groans]
- Gray, hang in there.
You're doing just fine.
- No, I'm not doing fine.
I'm the Titanic.
- No!
- Yes.
- You just gotta...
You gotta get focused.
You gotta center yourself, and you gotta march back in there... and you show them who's the boss.
Who's the Boss?
I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light had really weird hair, but...
Gray!
You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?
You gotta get out of your head and get into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head and into your body.
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.
Center yourself.
[Exhales]
- And go.
- Go.
Go.
[Lana] Gimme a "P. "Gimme an "R. "
Gimme an "O."
What's that spell?
B-Pro!
Yeah!
Whoo!
[Giggling]
Lana, what the hell are you doing?
I promoted Miss Valentine to creative executive on the Bartlett account... because I thought it would be best to show Julia two perspectives.
- You mean the one of her tits and the one of her ass?
- Gray!
I'm sure that Lana has 36 double-D ideas... for the account, and I'll just give you your privacy to fondle through them.
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.
I'm sure it cost me my job.
Well, with copy like that, they should be begging you to stay.
Here.
Drink that while it's still hot.
That, young lady, is my granny's secret recipe.
Mmm!
This is so good.
What's in this?
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey and a wee bit of nutmeg.
Gordy,you are amazing.
You barely know me and you're such a great friend.
You're gonna make some lucky girl very happy one day.
So are you.
God, everything is so complicated.
If it was 30 years ago, I could just move away and join a convent.
- Those outfits are so hideous.
- [Chuckles]
You know, if you want my advice... and I don't suppose you do, but I'm going to give it to you anyway.
- I think you have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?
You have to tell her the truth.
- I can't do that.
- Yes,you can.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I mean, for all you know, she might feel the same way about you.
Come on.
Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.
But you won't know that until you talk to her.
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?
What if you go through your entire life saying, "What if?"
What happens if she does feel the same way?
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.
- He doesn't talk to you now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.
And do you foresee that ever changing?
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm.
Just drink your tea.
This is so good.
Are you sure this is just tea, nutmeg and honey?
Wee bit of whiskey.
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!
What kind of shortbread is this?
- Mmm, short.
- [Chuckles]
[Gray] God, they're so beautiful and magical and peaceful.
Will they have babies here?
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality among mammals.
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales... but did you know that over 50% of elephants are gay?
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People... over loudspeakers and watch their feet.
- I'm kidding.
- [Laughs]
So where've you been hiding?
I've left three messages and no answer, and Sam won't say a word.
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.
Anything you want to talk about?
Do you remember that night we spent together in Las Vegas before you got married to Sam?
Barely.
I mean, I remember having a great time... but I think you got me too drunk to remember anything else.
Why?
Did I say something really stupid?
- It's not what you said.
- God.
What did I do?
I don't know if you did anything.
It might have just been me.
- Oh, my God.
I remember.
- You do?
- Yes.
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.
How could you let your brother marry me?
I didn't know if you were conscious of what was going on.
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?
I sounded like a cat in heat, didn't I?
Is that what you think we're talking about?
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?
- No.
That was it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Tell the truth.
Did you try to convince Sam not to marry me?
There was no convincing him.
Trust me.
If I could have, I would have.
You know, every morning I wake up before Sam does... and I just watch him.
I just lie there and stare.
And I love the way his nose wrinkles when he's dreaming... and the little purring sound that he makes when he's about to wake up.
And the way that he keeps his hand on my thigh the whole night... just to let me know that he's there.
And I know it may seem crazy... but love is crazy, isn't it?
[Laughing] It sure is.

- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah.
Gray.
Seems Julia wasn't thrilled with the way our last presentation went.
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated or patronized anymore.
- Actually, I was gonna give you a promotion, but...
- What?
I asked Jordan to make you the executive creative director on my account... and to give you free rein to do whatever you want.
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea was yours.
I think you have great ideas.
You just haven't been given the freedom to explore them fully.
I like your energy, your spunk, your candidness... and I think with the right support... you're gonna give me exactly what I'm looking for.
Wow!
- I don't know what to say.
- [Woman On Intercom] Sorry to interrupt, Gray... but your 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics is in the small conference room.
Oh, I don't have a 12:00 meeting with Brother Electronics.
They said they confirmed it with your office.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.
Isn't she adorable?
[Chuckles]
Hi!
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't have you in my book.
Hey.
See,you forgot your toothbrush... and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard, part soft bristles... must be hard to come by.
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?
And to say I'm sorry.
I overreacted...
Little bit.
Not a lot.
Little bit.
After all, you have to admit... it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...
I'm not quite sure why I got so surprised... 'cause if you think about it... it's almost inevitable that you and I would end up liking the same girl, isn't it?
You're acting...
You're acting very rational.
It's too rational.
You used to do this when we were kids.
Then I'd turn around and you'd tackle me.
I should be getting my knees in the lock-down position.
You know, Gray...
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.
You know that, right?
Being without you I feel like one half of me is missing.
Lately I've been feeling very lopsided.
- Oh, Sam.
- Just 'cause you're totally gay... and in love with my wife doesn't mean we can't work things out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.
Now, this is good.
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!
[Gray Squeals]
- [Gray Whimpering] Oh, my...
- [Sam] Gray!
Gray!
Gray!
How ya doin'?
How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.
Put your eyes back in your heads.

[Bell Dings]
- Hey, what...
- [Alarm Bell Ringing]
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.
- I never wanna see another human being ever again.
- No.
Look.
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad...
Who cares what those people think?
I care.
They're probably calling Jerry Springer right now as we speak.
No.
No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?
For having to be related to me.
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel... [Groans]
Gray, look.
You're just...
You're just coming out, okay?
- I am never coming out of this elevator.
- This is probably... the biggest revelation of your entire life.
It's normal to be going nuts.
- It's normal.
- I don't feel normal.
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.
I don't feel any of those things.
Well, how do you feel?
- Lonely.
- Why?
Because I'm never gonna be able to walk down the street... holding hands with my partner... without the rest of the world giving us a look.
I may never have the wedding that I once dreamed of... and I may never have children... and one day, when I die... people will never give as much respect to my grieving lover... as if she were my husband.
Gray...
- it's not as if you made a choice.
- [Sobs]
That's what terrifies me.
It's so much easier to be someone else.
Do you remember when we were kids... you would have been about six... and Dad came home to tell Mom he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.
Yeah.
Remember we stayed in the closet all night... just cuddled up like two little mice and... listened to their whole fight.
I was... so angry.
I was... hurt.
I was just...
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there and kick his ass...
- and you remember what you said to me?
- Hmm.
You were just six... but you said it was gonna be okay... that Dad was not gonna live a lie... that he was gonna try and be happy... and that everyone deserved to be happy.
I said that?
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.
Why are you being so nice to me?
- You should hate me.
- For what?
For having good taste?
You never have to worry about it.
I mean, she's completely, madly, passionately... like cow-jump-over-the-moon in love with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great... for me.
Not so great for you.
But you're not gonna make me feel guilty for this are you?
Mm-mmm.
Gray, you know what?
You can't expect the first girl that you fall in love with... to love you back.
That's...
That's not how it works.
That would be the equivalent of settling down when you were age 12.
You haven't gone through gay puberty yet.
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?
- No.
Of the elevator.
- Of the elevator.
[Carrie] I should have broken up with Dereck ages ago.
I am having the best time.
- So what about you?
Have you met anyone yet?
- Not yet.
Really?
Girls should be lining up around the block for you.
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?
It depends, I guess.
- Funny.
You need funny.
- Funny would be good.
- And stylish.
No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.
And for the love of God, don't wind up... with one of those ladies who doesn't believe in waxing.
- You're killing me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
- Have you ever been attracted to me?
- No.
- Really?
- No.
- Not even a little?
- No.
- Huh.
Oh.
Not even last year, when I was in shape after taking those Pilates classes?
Or last week when I wore that pink Marc Jacobs dress to work... and you told me how cute I looked?
You looked so cute.
You are cute, but, you know, not cute that way, cute.
Hmm.
Wow.
That's so depressing.
It's not like I'm into girls, but if I was a girl who was into girls...
I'd definitely be into me, 'cause I think I'm a catch.
You are a catch, but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.
Hmm.
But you said you don't have a type.
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.
Wait.
Don't you usually have therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?
Oh, my God.
I'm so late.
Shoot.
Okay.
You know, I don't really want to go, so watch this.
[Beeping]
Sydney, it's Gray.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I don't wanna go to the batting cages... and I don't wanna go rock climbing or bowling or anywhere with you... 'cause I'm feeling really good about myself... and I don't think you're a very good therapist for me, so you're fired.
- Thank you, and have a nice day.
- [Laughs]
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?
That was amazing.
[Exhales] Do you want to get a mani-pedi before we go back to work?
- Sure.
I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.
What if I dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?
- Yes.
- Really?
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!

I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?
Because you're gay, and you have to start behaving' like it.
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?
No, but you haven't had sex with a woman yet... and, you know, that's like being black... and never having listened to the Jackson Five... or being Jewish and never having a knish... or being Indian and never having had a curry or being...
Or being Scottish and not keeping your mouth shut?
- I suppose so.
Come on.
- Hi.
Sorry.
No men allowed.
Wh...
Isn't that against the law?
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.
- No exceptions.
No men.
- Forget it.
Well, just go in by yourself.
I can't go in by myself.
Are you kidding?
I have an idea.
[In Falsetto] I would like an Apricot Sour, please.
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.
And a touch of lemon and a squeeze of lime.
And a little bit of sugar on the rim.
Comin' up.
Apricot Sour?
I thought that was what you women drank, for Christ's sakes.
- One of your eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.
Hi.
Can I buy you a drink?
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.
See, but thanks.
You don't?
- Shut up.
- [Giggling]
This is quite tasty, actually.
Let's get out of here.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.
Hey, give it a minute.
Oh, my God.
It's Julia Bartlett.
- Quick, quick.
I gotta get out of here.
- Why?
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello.
Is there anybody in?
No.
Her?
You think?
Gray, did your mom ever tell you... what your I.Q. scores were?
[Chuckles]
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.
I'm just taking a break from working on your account.
Gray, I didn't come over here to check up on you.
[Both Laughing]
Um, hello.
Uh, my name's Georgette.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.
And, uh, lovely.
And I'm just gonna leave you two to, uh... to, uh... to catch up on everything.
- Mmm.
Lovely.
- Don't go.
Yeah, it was lovely to see you too.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Dutch way...
Three kisses.
So, uh...
Fine.
It's fine.
I'm fine.
You're fine.
Everything's gonna be fine, and I've got to go now.
Bye.
You really surprised me the other day.
I had no idea you were gay.
[Exhales] That makes two of us.
You're not just coming out, are you?
Put it this way.
My hotel's been closed for a long time... but tonight's the grand opening.
There have been a few fake openings... but tonight's the real deal.
[Laughs] I...
No, I don't understand.
[Whispering] Yes, I'm just coming out.
[Whispering] I don't think anyone in here will mind.
[Both Laughing]
You really are adorable.
I always thought so.
Really?
From day one, in that little cream, pin-striped suit you were wearing.
I like that suit too.
I think I got it at, uh, Banana Republic.
Or maybe it was, uh, Emporio Armani.
Actually, it could have been Barneys, but the shirt was from Bloomies.
Listen.
I have this beautiful bottle of cognac... that I just brought back from France, and I would...
- I'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?
No.
My place.
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.
Uh, okay, well...
[Exhales] I like cognac.

Finally I saw the status of Yokogawa and Tokyo in bomb
I stared the view of both side of the road.
And the expression of the men and lady on the road.
my impression is... the factories in Yokogawa and Tokyo are disappeared in the bomb.
This time I felt the truth meaning.

We affirm that, as members of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East,
we will duly administer justice according to law, without fear, favor or affection,
according to our conscience, and the best of our understanding,
and that we will not disclose or discover the vote or opinion of any particular member of the Tribunal
upon finding or sentence, but will preserve the inviolate secrecy of the counsel of every member.
We swear to God.
Please sit down.
Before we start, there are a few things I would like to clarify
First of all, we don't need to be overly polite among ourselves.
Please just call me William.
We should treat each other as equals and consider ourselves one big family.
I hope this would be a pleasant experience for all of us.
As this trial will be conducted on the basis of the Common Law System, the seating of the judges will be as follows:
The United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, Canada
France, Australia, the Netherlands,
India, New Zealand, and the Philippines.
I will not accept that arrangement.
Pardon me.
What do you mean?
I believe the seating order of the judges in this trial should follow the order of signatures on the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.
China was second on the list.
Therefore, the judge from China should be seated right after the United States.
My dear Mei, this is a courtroom, not a reenactment of surrender.
Then perhaps,
Sir William could explain his reasons for this arrangement?
Dr. Mei, this is has been the common practice.
What common practice?
Whose practice?
Isn't following the order of signatures in the Instrument of Surrender a common practice?
Dr. Mei, we are here to judge war criminals.
Why are you making fuss over such a trivial matter?
This is no trivial matter.
Besides, Our concern here is what's right and what's wrong.
There's nothing trivial about it.
Dr. Mei, then please suggest a fair method.
If we are not going to follow the order on the Instrument of Surrender...
Maybe... it might even be the fairest... we'll put our judges on the scale, and the seating arrangement will be determined by weight
Dr. Mei, the method you suggest is eminently fair, but would only be appropriate for boxing matches.
This is a courtroom, not a boxing ring.
If the seating arrangement is not to be determined by weight, then the only fair method is to follow the order on the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.
I have no wish at all to allow this international tribunal to become a boxing ring.
Stop!
Chinese pig!
Get out of Japan!
We were beaten to American,
Not China!
Get out!
Cooperate with US.
Gendarme, finished the enquiry.
driver was kept back temporarily.
For the further enquiry
Xiao Nan and I was both ashamed to the driver.
Also sigh with emotion.
Come in.
Dr. Mei, there will be a rehearsal for tomorrow's opening ceremony at 4:00 this afternoon.
Please be there on time and wear your judicial robe;
photographers will be present.
Thank you
Good afternoon, sit down.
Since the International Military Tribunal for the Far East formally begins hearing its cases tomorrow,
I will announce the seating order of the judges for final dress rehearsal today...
The seating order of the judges is as follows:
United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, Canada,
France, Australia, the Netherlands, India,
New Zealand and the Philippines...
Dr. Mei, please let me explain.
Please calm down and listen
I'm listening
The main reason I placed the American and British judges on my left and right is because they have a better understanding of the Common Law, which would make this trial fun more smoothly.
This decision absolutely does not reflect any prejudice against China...
Forgive me for being frank.
We all know that this is an international tribunal, not British or American.
I don't see any need to seat the American and British judges in the center.
Dr. Mei, please look at this problem from a different angle.
With this arrangement, you will be seated between the American and French judges, instead of next to the Russian general.
I would imagine that would please you.
Sir William, that's insulting.
As a Chinese, it is my solemn duty to remind you that I didn't come to Tokyo to be pleased.
My homeland China has been invaded and plundered by the Japanese for over fifty years.
To the Chinese people, trying Japanese war criminals is a heavy responsibility, a grave responsibility.
We are not here for pleasure.
Doctor Mei, I would like to solemnly remind you as well that.
this seating arrangement originated from an order given by the Supreme Commander, General MacArthur himself
It would be extremely unfortunate if your refusal to accept this seating arrangement were to cause friction in Chinese-American relations.
Your government might not agree with your decisions.
I refuse to accept this arrangement that has ground at all in any law or reason.
In this war against Japanese aggression
China has suffered the most and fought the longest, the hardest.
The Britain, on the other hand, has been retreating and surrendering time and time again.
It's unthinkable that China's place in this trial should be relegated to a spot below Britain.
I do not believe the government of China will agree to this arrangement...
In addition,
I don't believe that this seating arrangement came from the Supreme Commander himself
Hold on.
Let me discuss this with the other judges first.
I'll have an answer for you in ten minutes.
Dr. Mei, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my colleagues unanimously see today just as a dress rehearsal and nothing more.
Why don't we just take a few pictures at the rehearsal now, and then tonight we'll open a full discussion regarding the actual seating order of tomorrow's court?
Sir William, I have to disappoint you as well.
I definitely will not participate in the rehearsal for this seating arrangement.
The whole world's photographers and reporters in rehearsal are now out there in the courtroom.
They are going to take photos and write reports on this seating arrangement.
When these reports and photos reach China, do you know what's going to happen?
The entire Chinese people will all reproach me for my weakness and my incompetence.
If I agree to this arrangement,
I'll be insulting my country.
I'd be insulting all my countrymen's suffering, sacrifice, and perseverance in resisting the Japanese aggression.
Everything.
Sir William, can you understand?
It is for this reason that I will not take part in this rehearsal.
As for myself, I will report the matter back to my government to see if they support me.
If they don't, I shall resign immediately and ask them to replace me.
Please do not leave.
How about this?
I'll get our colleagues' opinion on this again
I absolutely don't want you to go.
I'll be back in no more than ten minutes.
Alright, I'll wait another ten minutes.
Dr. Mei, you win.
Your country should be proud to have a fighter like you.
I'm not a fighter.
I'm a judge, a Chinese judge.
My dear Mei, can you do me a little favor?
Of course.
Call me William.
William.
Good evening, please give me some wine.
Yousuko, come here and join us
What's a pity, maybe next time will be OK.
For Japan's failure, cheers!
Mr. Shino, we have promised that we don't talk about the War any more!
Don't talk about the War
For our friendship, cheers
But Japan failed in the war
Japan really failed?

With the proud of a winner, to display your strength to us?
Or to talk about the past with Yousuko?

Did they have any fault?
But do you know how many people died in Shanghai and Nanjing?

This whole situation just makes me a little uncomfortable.
What's that?
I feel like I'm putting on a show here.
Court.
Please sit down.
The International Military Tribunal for the Far East is now in session.
All the defendants of this case were once leaders of Japan for the past several decades when Japanese power was at its peak.
They include prime ministers, foreign ministers, treasury ministers, chiefs of staff and military high commanders.
No matter how high they once stood, their treatment now is no different from that of the lowest of ordinary soldiers.
We will assure the defendants that a careful examination will be made before this court regarding the number and nature of the prosecution charges filed against them in the indictment, along with the declaration of all the applicable laws.
Honorable presiding judge and members of the court,
I am Joseph Keenan, the chief prosecutor for this International Military Tribunal for the Far East and for the United States of America,
The charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East clearly stipulates five separate charges with which the defendants have been indicted, as listed:
premeditation, organization, initiation, and or execution of a war in violation of international law, treaties, agreements or assurances.
In addition to these charges, participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing is also an offense against humanity...
Toujyou, I'll kill you
I'll kill you
Bring this people out of the court.
I'll kill you
Next, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East will hear the defendants' pleas to the charges brought by the prosecution.
I ask Mr. Web to blench this judgment.
Anyone with any objections on how this courtroom is ran should put them in writing.
The defense's oral argument is completely out of line.
This is an despicable ambush comparable to the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.
I insisted on my request.
and I challenge the qualification of all judges.
Control yourself.
He's provoking you on purpose.
This trial totally base on the haughty and bias of the Kultur.
base on the nongovernmental spirit that winner is king and the loser is thief.
judging the civilian life who exert their utmost effort for Asia peace and co-prosperity.
I doubt the court's equity.
also feel sorrow for the dignity of the law.
Silence!
Mr. Defense attorney, the courtroom is not preaching grounds for your theories or for your to set conditions.
Your first point concerns me personally.
Therefore, I withhold myself from the decision the other judges will make in a conference later.
I also don't think the other ten judges have the qualification of the International Military Tribunal.
So I think the conference of judges will not be fair, too.
I object!
Then in your opinion, what do you think would be fair?
Super court in United States of America.
That's completely out of question!
Court is adjourned.
How could an international court compose of eleven judges appointed by their respective democratic governments and organized by the best minds of international law lack the decorum of one federal court?
This is absolute provocation.
Since I've been the target,
I'm willing to abide by the ruling of a conference of judges.

fancy of great empire filled with his brain.
After our discussion, the ten judges unanimously agreed with the second article of the Tribunal, specifying the Allies' Supreme Commander's ability to appoint judges to this court on the basis of recommendations from their respective national governments.
Therefore, we do not possess the power to decide appointment, dismissal, or withdrawal of any judge.
That means the guilt or innocence of the 28 defendants must be based on the final verdict of this military tribunal.
Next, we will hear the defendants' plea to the charges.
The 28 accused shall now state whether they plead guilty or not guilty to the charges the prosecution brought against them in the indictment of the International Military Tribunal.
Defendant Sadao Araki, how do you plea, guilty or not guilty?
I petition the court to let my lawyer answer the question.
Petition denied.
The court requires you to speak for yourself.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.

Japanese criminal defend team's vice leader,
Who was also Hideki Tojyo's attorney,
Named Hirose Itiro,
Built a defend team composed of over one hundred people.
They used Long-term stratagem,
Never stop to make incident,
In order to throw the court into confusion,
Which made the trial get along.
It was not so bad as you thought,
I think we must win in first section,

They must receive applause.

Landlady,
Your Chinese was so perfect!
Mr. Kitano,

Hello
Gunni died.
Gunni died.
Gunni died.
It was your Chinese who killed Gunni.
Go away.
I'll kill you
It is you who killed my brother.
Kitano's brother Gunni
Was sent to China together with Hideo,
Hideo came back Japan now,
But Gunni was died.
Kitano's animosity to Chinese,
Was increased by Gunni's death,
Which made us anxious.
In that time,
Tokyo was involved into the animosity,
Which was derived from the war to Chinese.
When was the beginning of the Japan-China war,
That was the most important point we concerned
On China in the Tokyo trial
After the Guangdong Army entered the Northeast China,
Their frequently defiance action,
Made China-Japan relationship in this area tense up.
In the end, the China-Japan war began with
Guanggutun Incident, which was premeditated by Japan Army.
Mr. District attorney arbitrarily accused that the Huanggutun accident were the beginning of the Japanese aggression towards China, it against the truth,
obviously, it also confused the partly conflict and formal war.
At the time, the Beijing government was the only Chinese government recognized by the international community and as such it had diplomatic relations with other countries.
And, Zhang Zuolin was the head of that government.
I would like to ask the defense, when one country plots and succeeds in the assassination of the head of another government, if that is not an act of war between the two countries, then what is it
Dose Mr. District attorney have any evidence to proof that
The Huanghutun accident was done by Japanese army?
This is a deposition given by the former
Japanese Navy Minister Keisuke Okada.
Mr. District attorney
How could we believe the words a navy officer said?
Then who could give evidence that these events took place?
Of course the lieutenant officer.

I'm a farmer.
Please tell me what you saw on December 13, 1937, after the Japanese Army entered Nanjing.
Nanjing became hell on earth!
the Japanese army went into a killing frenzy burning everything in sight.
Endless looting and rape.
Honorable court,
This was came from witness Jon Maggie,
Which was shut on 22nd Dec, 1937.
I ask for the court to let me show it here.
Witness, what's your name
I'm Wang Defu.
Your profession?
I don't have any profession.
Then how do you make a living
I'm living in Banruo Temper in Nanjing now.
Before that, what did you do
A Thief.
Please say that clearly.
They always call me thief.
Where were you on December 13, 1397 when the Japanese Army entered Nanjing?
Did you leave the temple at any time?
We leaved.
How many monks went out with you?
Four monks.
Three real monks and I.
We meet some Japanese solider, and then they caught us.
How many of them were there and what were they doing?
They had over ten persons, they were raping a Chinese girl.
What did they want you to do
They asked us to rape the Chinese girl too.
Did you rape her?
No
What happened next?
They used bayonet,
And ask us to put off our clothes
They ask us to rape that Chinese girl.
Otherwise, they will kill us.
And then...
Mr. Mingxin didn't answer their request,
What did they do to Mingxin?
They cut off Mingxin's sexual organ.
Did Mingxin die?
He was rolling on the ground
The blood was all around his body
What about the Japanese soldiers?
What did they do?
Laughing, they were all laughing.
Then what happened to the rest of you?
Mr. Mingkong and Mingfa also didn't answer their request,
Did the Japanese soldiers also cut off their sexual organs?
Yes
Did they live?
No
You just said that,
The Japanese soldiers ask you and three teal monks
To rape that Chinese girl
Yes
They all didn't agree, so at last they died, is that right?
Yes
And you?
Why were you survive?
Were you agree?
Answer me.
Did you rape the girl?
Yes, I raped her.
Were you really forced to do
Or yourself also want to do this?
How can you proof yourself were forced to do?
How can you proof you were not willing to?
Damn it!
Asshole!
Damn it!
The war between Japan and China,
Just as the bust up between the brothers of the Asia Big Family.
Japan have no choice but to use some strong measure.
This is just as after the brother keep his temper for a long time he'll drive his little brother away.
This is in order to make China change his view.
Maybe our attitude was a little wildness,
But the original purpose was to do some good things,
The elder brother was loving the little brother.
And might I ask how the younger brother responded to his older brother's solicitude?
The little brother didn't understand our purpose.
He still didn't enjoy this love.
Don't talk about the Brothers any more!
Totally bullshit!
Bullshit!
In the last verdict of the international tribunal,
To the Nanjing Butcher in China,
This cognizance was made,
In the first six weeks of the Japanese aggression,
The number of innocent people who were butchered
Was over two hundred thousand.
This was the most discreet estimation
Of the international military tribunal.
The number Chinese government announced later
Made it clearly that
In Nanjing
There were three hundred thousand people were killed by Japanese Army.
Sakurako,
Sakura was Fang Zi's sister, she came back from China,
She joined battle service group for the enthusiasm of dedication to Japanese Army, but finally become sex tool for them.
Welcome!
Hideo, is this Mr. Hideo?
That's very fine!
You are still living.
Please sit down, You'll be free drinking today.
It's so good to see you alive.
Mr. Xiao Nan,
Do you familiar with that person?
He's the brother of one of my friends.
That's fine!
An old friend come here, free drinking today.
Mr. Hideo, don't you really remember me?
Do you know each other
Hideo,
Please forgive me.
Don't believe Chinese people.
I believe my own judge only.
Yousuko, don't forget that you're Japanese.
Yousuko Yousuko
Mr. Hideo.
What happened to my brother?
Your brother is in the pothouse now
Brother, what's wrong with you
You Chinese people are still so savage in our country.
I'll kill you
Hideo,
Kill these Chinese.
It's them who make Japan become a humiliator.
It's them who make Japan become a humiliator.
It's them who make us become orphan.
Japanese devil!
No.
Brother!
Brother!
It had been one year when I came to Tokyo,
Not only the Chinese government
But also I, the party judge,
Was never thought that
A legality trial
Which the winner country to the defeat country
Became so difficult and complex.
Here also has joy,
But not to me
It belong to other people
I'm just a visitor.
The criminals' individual defense started
What made the pressure of Mr. Xiang
Was the trial to
Doihara Kenji and Itagaki Siro.
These two criminals was the leader of
The Japanese-Chinese aggression.
Which made the Chinese people into pain and suffer.
If we were beaten by them in the court.
The result will not image.
The situation was that
Doihara Kenji kept silence until the end.
He tried to get rid of the trial with the loophole of Common Law System
Itagaki Siro was crankiness.
He wrote a 48-pages long apologia,
Said that he would fight with
The Chinese prosecution team.
Mr. Ni Zhengao was the leader of this team,
He came Tokyo to help Mr. Mei.
For all of accusations.
My party-
Mr. Doihara denied all.
furthermore he also think that facing all accusation,
He absolutely think it scorn to argue with accuser.
therefore for a Japanese army's reverence
He gave up justification for themselves.
I denied all accusations.
Can Japanese government seeing the Northeast people live in tribulation and scuffle?
We help them out of pity and friendship.
Is it the guilt?
Since I was charged as landtied officer.
I always persist in withdraw, peace, armistice.
Whatever accusation will be made by the prosecution,
I will always be one of the Japanese who love peace!
I'm not guilty.
You just said that the September 18 Incident, also known as the battle on September 18, 1931, was never premeditated, nor a conspiracy.
Is that correct?
Yes
However, you admitted earlier that the Kuandong Army did formulate a battle plan before the Huanggutun Incident.
Did you not agree to do it?
I have to explain this battle plan to you.
I don't want to hear your explanations!
My question is,
Did you report the battle plan to the central command, and did they approve it?
Yes
Then, how can you perpetuate your statement of no premeditation and conspiracy for the September 18 Incident?
Because comparing our Guangdong army with Chinese Northeast army, for military strength, we are in inferior position by 1:20
Therefore we must prevent their attack.
we just self-defense.
How did you know the Northeast Army was going to attack you
We received some information,
After that we start making this plan.
The information on hand?
What information
Mr. Itagaki, don't forget you're in a courtroom.
Only the evidence matters.
So, if you are going to testify that the Northeast Army was about to launch an attack on the Japanese Army, then you have to provide proof.
In your defense brief, you stated that during the negotiations for the Three Power Accord between Japan, Germany and Italy you didn't advocate expanding the war.
In addition, when the Changgufeng Incident occurred on the border between China and the Soviet Union, you tirelessly sought a peaceful solution.
Is that right?
Yes
As a result, your emperor punished you for your actions.
Is that correct
Isn't that right?
How did you know this?
I'm the one asking questions here, not you.
Answer me, Isn't that right?
That's not true.
This document was found by the Chinese prosecution team in the archives of the Japanese Army Internal Affairs Office.
It is a journal kept by Saionji and Harada.
It records in detail how the emperor severely reprimanded Itagaki for both these incidents.
And you have the nerve to deny this ever happened?
Your Honors, I now submit this evidence to the court.
please examine it and have it recorded.
Near the end of your term as minister of the army, you sent an emissary to China to meet with two individuals... the first premier of the Republic of China,
Tang Shaoyi, and the former head of the Northern Warlords, Wu Peifu
Is that correct?
Yes
Your emissary's purpose was to entice them to participate in a puppet organization you were trying to set up.
Is that right?
I don't know.
Well, do you at least remember whom you sent?
Was that person none other than the one who usurped the position of mayor of Shenyang, installed the puppet emperor Pu Yi, fraternized with the Japanese Kuandong Army, plotted to bring self-rule to North China, instigated the independence movement in Inner Mongolia,
incited traitors everywhere to set up puppet governments and traitorous organizations never hesitated to do evil, and now sits in the defendants' table, namely Kenji Dohihara?
Is that him?
Answer me.
This is the most brilliant victory of china's prosecution team
During the 10 days heckle with Itagaki
Ni Zheng'ao rebutted and required those things
He mentioned in the refutation.
Finally, by the method that approaching the topic indirectly,
He beat the Doihara who not say a word.
The war which was launched and enlarged by Hidekitogyo
Brought the Asia a very severe disaster,
Also, brought Japan a far-reaching secret anguish.
This secret anguish,
Pervaded several decades after the war finished,
Makes the young of that age full of
Being at sea, despair and even crazy,
The pain of lose destroy many people's spirit
At the very beginning, the holy war to the Asia Pacific,
And the worship to Hidekitogyo
To where should Japan go?
During the time that the young of Japan thinking of the question, also worry about their own destiny and future.
War is just like a beast, who licked up life, honor and country,
As well as blood and ideal.
Thank you.
Japanese people are all good people,
But why they all had blind faith to the emperor?
So why the Chinese people had blind faith to the Huangdi?
But why the emperor had to start a war?
So why Chengjisihan had to crusade towards to the west?
Why your Tang Empery start war in Chinese western areas,
And fight broad to Korea?
Emperors all want to start wars.
So we must send revolutions.
Revolution?
Miss Chiba
What happened?
What happened?
Miss Chiba
Help!
Hurry!
Help!
This became a unsettled case in the end,
The killer was not found.
From that day,
Xiao Nan and I had never went there.
any more.
The trial to Hideki Tojyo
Would be another fierce fight.
At that time, different public voices came up all over the world.
There was request of judging the emperor again.
It was a controversial issue in judges' meetings.
But after the secret discussion between MacArthur and the emperor,
The issue was left unsettled.
Later on, Sir William showed his standpoint of not charging the emperor and the imperial family.
Brother, I wanna go to eat noodle.
Welcome.
This way please.
Ying Zi, go and serve the customers.
Welcome.
Give me a bowl of noodle and a bunch of fish.
Sakurako, go to help your father,
Little child, never mind please.
What happiness.
Dong Tiao government called 100 million citizens to go into battle.
The temporary council passed 3800 million Yen according to the request of Prime Minister Dong Tiao.
Don't change the channel.
Temporary budget for supplement of military expense
firstly I announce here, delegating my party
Hideki Tojyo
My party
- Hideki Tojyo he except be evidence by himself,
He will not require any other attestor on the court.
In addition, he will not submit any evidence.
over
Next, my party will readout his affidavit.
finally, maybe this is the last opportunity on the court permit.
I would like to repeat here.
Japanese empire's national policy
The policy was pursued by the officer who occupy the position legally at that year.
Not aggression and not exploitation
We just pursued according to constitution and law regulation.
But still met the rigorous reality.
We took the national fate to be ante, but we lost
I insisted on that this was a war of self-defense.
Not a war of disobeying the International Law.
About the responsibility of the war's failure
This is my fault.
It means that I'll take on all of the responsibility.
Hideki Toujyou.
19th, Dec, Syouwa 22 year, Tokyo.
Now, according to your reasoning, on the one hand you carried out peaceful negotiations between Japan and China, but on the other you occupied China with a powerful military force.
Aren't those two contradictory?
They didn't contradictory any more.
Did you ever contemplate that the invasion of Manchuria might turn the Chinese public against Japan?
Chinese public antipathy against Japan was existing long before.
But Japan have never aggressed China.
Silence!
How many people did the Japanese Army kill?
I don't know.
This document was published by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters
It reports that between the period July 1937 and June 1941, the Japanese Army killed two million and fifteen thousand Chinese people...
Isn't it logical that must slaughtering two million Chinese lives could rouse the fury of the Chinese people?
Please answer the question.
I also think it was a misfortune.
Many of those you butchered were innocent civilians.
Why was the treatment to these non-involved innocent civilians so atrocious?
What is called there is no relation between people and war
China is same as we Japan.
As the captain of China regime, direct people to oppugn Japan and insult Japan.
so draw on killing.
this is the wrong of China regime.
no relation to us.
So I insist do not withdraw from China.
Furthermore keep extending the war.
Is it right?
I don't like answer yes or no.
This is a courtroom.
Your wants are irrelevant and an answer is mandatory.
So, yes or no
Object
The procurator didn't have right to ask like that.
Objection overruled!
The witness must answer the prosecutor's question with yes or no.
Answer me!
Yes or no?
No
No?
Did Japan evacuate troops from China after you received instructions to form a cabinet in October 1941?
No, but that was
You already answered my question.
I don't need an explanation.
In your statement, you said that Japan's decision to go to war with the United States,
Britain and Holland which was the direct result for those countries freezing Japan assets on July 26, 1941, correct?
Yes
You already told the court that the emperor loves peace, didn't you
Yes
Furthermore, no Japanese official or commoner would dare to disobey the emperor's orders, is that correct?
What I said was a national sensibility,
That was different from the Emperor's responsibility.
But as a matter of fact, did you not initiate hostilities against the United States, Britain and the Netherland?
That was decision of our council.
If the emperor opposed the war, would it still have happened?
I have already said lots of times that the Emperor didn't have any responsibility,
Japan had no choice but initiate the war.
Do you think initiating hostilities is morally and legally acceptable?
I think it is acceptable, whenever past now and future,
I still think it is acceptable.
So if you and your colleagues were acquitted,
You would go out and do it all over again?
You would continue to allow Japan to launch invasions and start wars?
Yes
Dear honors, the prosecution'd like to announce that we've completed our cross examination of Hideki Tojyo
Ying Zi
All be seated.
The 817th session of International Military Tribunal for the Far East is now in session.
Next, the prosecution will make its closing argument.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Honorable judges, and members of the court... all of the accused, joined in a formulation and execution of a plan a conspiracy whose publish was to establish Japan's military, political, and economic domination over the countries
within the Pacific and Indian Oceans!
In order to achieve this goal,
Japan alone or working with liked minds,
embarked on a war of aggression to subjugate all who stood in its way.
My prosecution team and I have produced more than enough evidence to prove the participation of the accused in the above summarized criminal actions.
Throughout the history of civilization, no one has ever seen such a peak of cruelty and barbarity.
Countless people died horrendous, unthinkable deaths to feed Japan's insatiable appetite for domination.
By their actions, they have challenged human civilization, challenged peace, and challenged the whole world!
Their mutual delict intent.
in order to be sure the reign position of Japanese king.
No worth guilt than start the aggression battle.
the safe of all world people be threatened by this intrigue.
be wrecked by the war only result of the intrigue.
is taking world people to undergo dead and pain
Therefore, I, Joseph Keenan, on behalf of my colleagues on the Allied prosecution team, solemnly request the honorable judges of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to severely punish those responsible for this horrible war of aggression,
in the honor of justice in the spirit of compassion, and in the honor of humanity.
The presentation of the cases before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is now concluded.
The verdict will be announced after the judges' final deliberations.
Until that time, the court is in recess.
Yuiqi, what are you doing
Revenge, for my brother
For all persons who died in the war
It was me who killed your brother
Why?

Have you seen a child kill persons?
Yuiqi, what a chastity boy
But he became a devil in the war
I had to killed him
Japanese devil!
Brother
Brother

I can accept you not to love me
But
I can't accept you
to love a Chinese!
I love you.
Yousuko!
Yousuko!
Are you alright?
Please say something to me
Please say something to me!
I won't go back China
I won't go back China, Please say something to me!
Yousuko, Please say something to me
Please say something to me
Far east international military tribunal entered the final stage.
judgers from 11 countries have huge difference for the judgment.
and appeared opposed emotions.
especially for the Hidekitojyo and other 24 criminals.
on the question if judge them gallows
Occurred feud.
is it the problem that how to condemn?
a reporter of English Times News, whose forecast is very surprise
on the problem whether use death penalty
He said, there are 2 splits among eleven countries.
furthermore it is the most number which disagree with dead penalty... do not ask me any more.
I can say nothing to you.
people cannot identify the devilishness of the war and crime, until suffer the harm
I have never regret, but today...
I regretted.
chose to come to Japan.
Thinking of Xiangyu's tragedy, I want to commit suicide.
Mei, you want to learn Xiang Yu?
And do you want to die?
if you died, then the judger could stand by you.
could punish the war criminal you could jump down from the window,
I do not hold you.
Do you think you can help by doing so?
Bullshit.
I think you are probably a coward.
do you think you can move god, depend upon your emotion?
do you think the judgers will stand by you, depend upon your temper and your complaint?
action, show me your action!
there is a logion in Hunan as long as you can not fight me died, I will stand up!
I will stand up.
If no one has anything new to add, we can begin voting...
Alright, since no one has anything left to contribute, let's get started.
Sir William, would I say a few more things before we start voting?
Of course
Thank you
Please give me a glass of water
We all agree that the criminals are guilty.
But we cannot agree if they should be hanged for what they did.
A lot of innocent people died for the war.
They can only rest in peace when these criminals are punished by the death penalty.
Mr. Bernard your objection to the death penalty is because you believe a civilized country should have abolished the death penalty.
Am I right?
absolutely right
In general, I agree with you but in this case, I have my doubts...
Mei, I'd be happy to discuss it
According to your logic, civilization should be respected but what about life?
Shouldn't life be respected?
I don't think I need to answer that question
You should already know the answer perfectly well
I'm sure you wouldn't deny the preciousness of life because everyone only lives once
Because everyone has one life.
Suppose this cup represents humanity and the water represents civilization
Please excuse my crudeness
Civilization is created by human being
If people were ruthlessly murdered, how can we talk about civilization
Mr. Bernard
Mei, pls.
Seat down.
Mei, you want to discuss Buddhism with me
I don't know a lot about Buddhism but I have a great deal of respect for it... when I was a child, I learned from my parents
I've known that Buddhism encourages people to do good and avoid doing evil.
Correct?
That's a fundamental idea
Besides the teachings to promoting goodness, isn't there also punishment of the evil
Yes.
But Buddhism says that punishment is carried out the next life.
You mean if someone does evil in this lifetime, he'll pay for it in the next.
Right?
That's right
But who will prevent the crime this lifetime?
Could Buddha prevent Japan not to start wars again?
Dose Hideki Tojyo believe Buddha?
Buddha will help him believe
Buddha will love him and forgive him for everything he's done.
In the end, Buddha will embrace everyone
That's how his power works we are side with Buddha hoping that in the future, there are no war anymore.
No crime or evil.
But expectation in spirit can affect what's happen in realism.
Those unbearable ugliness and trample on humanity
I don't have any doubts about the power of Buddha,
But I doubt that if the people can reach light under the direction of Buddha.
Buddha says believe makes the dream come true,
But what if these criminals do not believe in Buddha at all?
I agree to the ancient Greeks' proverb
What god has will belong to him at last.
Mr. Pal
Why we come to here, the judges from 11 countries, have come to Japan, for what?
so we must punish the criminals according to law.
Mei, don't try to persuade me anymore
I still think my viewpoint is correct.
Mr. Pal, I won't try to persuade you any further
The ancient Greeks had a proverb
Fate sees the world more properly than we do
I can see that I'm next.
Please...
Lao Wei, my dear judger
All of you here are legal experts from all over the world
I want to ask you what is law and what is the function of it
Throughout the 817th long tribunal between the two years,
We finally confirm that they are guilty
But now we were talking about the civilization and the religion
Gentlemen,
This is not classroom of collage,
This is not temper
This is court!
What we need to talk about is how to punish the criminals
I think the role of religion is to tell people what can be done, to tell people to do good and to forgive.
On the other hand,
Law prescribes what cannot be done.
Otherwise, you will be punished by law.
You will have to go to the guillotine and the scaffold.
This is law
This is why I insist on imposing the death penalty on the war criminals
Besides robbing the resource of other countries and expanding his territory
Japan also killed thousands of innocent people
Japanese army's plundering raping backfiring and killing,
They had killed numerous innocent people- the Chinese, the Koreans, the Filipinos, the Singaporeans, the Americans, the Englishmen...
These crimes are not enough to bring them to justice
If neither Japan nor the war criminals receive the severest punishment who can assure that they will never wage war again?
Who can assure that Japan will never invade other countries?
Who can assure that the Japanese militaristic spirit will never revive?
anyone of you here is able to make an assurance like this
What I wanted to say, what I should've said, it's done
We can vote now for all those who died in the war... for closing eyes in death pls.
Think it over.
They are watching us, watching the pens we hold in our hands...
No for the death penalty
No
Yes for the death penalty
No
No
Yes
No
Yes
Yes
Yes
Gentleman as you see this 5 to 5
This is the last ballot...
This one last ballot will decide everything
Yes
I will now read the verdict... the court believes that there is no need to consider whether or not the accused are guilty of the conspiracy to violate treaties and accords Japan had with other countries because charge of executing a plot along with other countries to wage an aggressive war
is already the gravest crime one can commit.
The court finds all the Japanese defendants guilty as charged!
international military tribunal concluded,
In the end, seven criminals were punished to death.
until now, I can't call to mind, on this morning, if the judges who agreed death sentence were not reach six, what will happen to me what will happen to all the Chinese people what will happen to the whole world
otherwise, all the judges had pledged in the beginning we would never disclose that who agree the death sentence and who not agree, what I what to say was that
I have tried my best...
Finally I saw the status of Yokogawa and Tokyo in bomb
I stared the view of both side of the road.
And the expression of the men and lady on the road.
my impression is... the factories in Yokogawa and Tokyo are disappeared in the bomb.
This time I felt the truth meaning.
whatever men or lady they and what I saw before 22 years in Japan.
already so much difference.
Who changed it?
it cannot do not let them take it...
Who we are going to judge.
they disturbed the world.
tormented China.
And ruined the future of their country.
a state had good future.
therefore result in the fate.
Do evil by themselves.
this is a tragedy in the history
Also an retribution
We affirm that, as members of the lnternational Military Tribunal for the Far East,
we will duly administer justice according to law, without fear, favor or affection,
according to our conscience, and the best of our understanding,
and that we will not disclose or discover the vote or opinion of any particular member of the Tribunal
upon finding or sentence, but will preserve the inviolate secrecy of the counsel of every member.
We swear to God.
Please sit down.
Before we start, there are a few things I would like to clarify
First of all, we don't need to be overly polite among ourselves.
Please just call me William.
We should treat each other as equals and consider ourselves one big family.
I hope this would be a pleasant experience for all of us.
As this trial will be conducted on the basis of the Common Law System, the seating of the judges will be as follows:
The United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, Canada
France, Australia, the Netherlands,
India, New Zealand, and the Philippines.
I will not accept that arrangement.
Pardon me.
What do you mean?
I believe the seating order of the judges in this trial should follow the order of signatures on the Japanese lnstrument of Surrender.
China was second on the list.
Therefore, the judge from China should be seated right after the United States.
My dear Mei, this is a courtroom, not a reenactment of surrender.
Then perhaps,
Sir William could explain his reasons for this arrangement?
Dr. Mei, this is has been the common practice.
What common practice?
Whose practice?
Isn't following the order of signatures in the instrument of Surrender a common practice?
Dr. Mei, we are here to judge war criminals.
Why are you making fuss over such a trivial matter?
This is no trivial matter.
Besides, Our concern here is what's right and what's wrong.
There's nothing trivial about it.
Dr. Mei, then please suggest a fair method.
If we are not going to follow the order on the instrument of Surrender...
Maybe... it might even be the fairest... we'll put our judges on the scale, and the seating arrangement will be determined by weight
Dr. Mei, the method you suggest is eminently fair, but would only be appropriate for boxing matches.
This is a courtroom, not a boxing ring.
If the seating arrangement is not to be determined by weight, then the only fair method is to follow the order on the Japanese lnstrument of Surrender.
I have no wish at all to allow this international tribunal to become a boxing ring.
Stop!
Chinese pig!
Get out of Japan!
We were beaten to American,
Not China!
Get out!
Cooperate with US.
Gendarme, finished the enquiry.
driver was kept back temporarily.
For the further enquiry
Xiao Nan and I was both ashamed to the driver.
Also sigh with emotion.
Come in.
Dr Mei, there will be a rehearsal for tomorrow's opening ceremony at 4:00 this afternoon.
Please be there on time and wear your judicial robe;
photographers will be present.
Thank you
Good afternoon, sit down.
Since the lnternational Military Tribunal for the Far East formally begins hearing its cases tomorrow,
I will announce the seating order of the judges for final dress rehearsal today...
The seating order of the judges is as follows:
United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, Canada,
France, Australia, the Netherlands, India,
New Zealand and the Philippines...
Dr. Mei, please let me explain.
Please calm down and listen
I'm listening
The main reason I placed the American and British judges on my left and right is because they have a better understanding of the Common Law, which would make this trial fun more smoothly.
This decision absolutely does not reflect any prejudice against China...
Forgive me for being frank.
We all know that this is an international tribunal, not British or American.
I don't see any need to seat the American and British judges in the center.
Dr. Mei, please look at this problem from a different angle.
With this arrangement, you will be seated between the American and French judges, instead of next to the Russian general.
I would imagine that would please you.
Sir William, that's insulting.
As a Chinese, it is my solemn duty to remind you that I didn't come to Tokyo to be pleased.
My homeland China has been invaded and plundered by the Japanese for over fifty years.
To the Chinese people, trying Japanese war criminals is a heavy responsibility, a grave responsibility.
We are not here for pleasure.
Doctor Mei, I would like to solemnly remind you as well that.
this seating arrangement originated from an order given by the Supreme Commander, General MacArthur himself
It would be extremely unfortunate if your refusal to accept this seating arrangement were to cause friction in Chinese-American relations.
Your government might not agree with your decisions.
I refuse to accept this arrangement that has ground at all in any law or reason.
In this war against Japanese aggression
China has suffered the most and fought the longest, the hardest.
The Britain, on the other hand, has been retreating and surrendering time and time again.
It's unthinkable that China's place in this trial should be relegated to a spot below Britain.
I do not believe the government of China will agree to this arrangement...
In addition,
I don't believe that this seating arrangement came from the Supreme Commander himself
Hold on.
Let me discuss this with the other judges first.
I'll have an answer for you in ten minutes.
Dr. Mei, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my colleagues unanimously see today just as a dress rehearsal and nothing more.
Why don't we just take a few pictures at the rehearsal now, and then tonight we'll open a full discussion regarding the actual seating order of tomorrow's court?
Sir William, I have to disappoint you as well.
I definitely will not participate in the rehearsal for this seating arrangement.
The whole world's photographers and reporters in rehearsal are now out there in the courtroom.
They are going to take photos and write reports on this seating arrangement.
When these reports and photos reach China, do you know what's going to happen?
The entire Chinese people will all reproach me for my weakness and my incompetence.
If I agree to this arrangement,
I'll be insulting my country.
I'd be insulting all my countrymen's suffering, sacrifice, and perseverance in resisting the Japanese aggression.
Everything.
Sir William, can you understand?
It is for this reason that I will not take take in this rehearsal.
As for myself, I will report the matter back to my government to see if they support me.
If they don't, I shall resign immediately and ask them to replace me.
Please do not leave.
How about this?
I'll get our colleagues' opinion on this again
I absolutely don't want you to go.
I'll be back in no more than ten minutes.
Alright, I'll wait another ten minutes.
Dr. Mei, you win.
Your country should be proud to have a fighter like you.
I'm not a fighter.
I'm a judge, a Chinese judge.
My dear Mei, can you do me a little favor?
Of course.
Call me William.
William.
Good evening, please give me some wine.

Don't forget this is a historic moment.
The whole world is watching us!
This whole situation just makes me a little uncomfortable.
What's that?
I feel like I'm putting on a show here.
Court.
Please sit down.
The International Military Tribunal for the Far East is now in session.
All the defendants of this case were once leaders of Japan for the past several decades when Japanese power was at its peak.
They include prime ministers, foreign ministers, treasury ministers, chiefs of staff and military high commanders.
No matter how high they once stood, their treatment now is no different from that of the lowest of ordinary soldiers.
We will assure the defendants that a careful examination will be made before this court regarding the number and nature of the prosecution charges filed against them in the indictment, along with the declaration of all the applicable laws.
Honorable presiding judge and members of the court,
I am Joseph Keenan, the chief prosecutor for this lnternational Military Tribunal for the Far East and for the United States of America,
The charter of the lnternational Military Tribunal for the Far East clearly stipulates five separate charges with which the defendants have been indicted, as listed:
premeditation, organization, initiation, and or execution of a war in violation of international law, treaties, agreements or assurances.
In addition to these charges, participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing is also an offense against humanity...
Toujyou, I'll kill you
I'll kill you
Bring this people out of the court.
I'll kill you
Next, the lnternational Military Tribunal for the Far East will hear the defendants' please to the charges brought by the prosecution.
I ask Mr Web for blench this justment.
Anyone with any objections on how this courtroom is ran should put them in writing.
The defense's oral argument is completely out of line.
This is an despicable ambush comparable to the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.
I insisted on my request.
and I challenge the qualification of all judges.
Control yourself.
He's provoking you on purpose.
This trial totally base on the haughty and bias of the Kultur.
base on the nongovernmental spirit that winner is king and the loser is thief.
judging the civilian life who exert their utmost effort for asia peace and co-prosperity.
I doubt the court's equity.
also feel sorrow for the dignity of the law.
Silence!
Mr. Defense attorney, the courtroom is not preaching grounds for your theories or for your to set conditions.
Your first point concerns me personally.
Therefore, I withhold myself from the decision the other judges will make in a conference later.
I also don't think the other ten judegs have the qualification of the lnternational Military Tribunal.
So I think the conference of judges will not be fair, too.
I object!
Then in your opinion, what do you think would be fair?
Super court in United States of America.
That's completely out of question!
Court is adjourned.
How could an international court compose of eleven judges appointed by their respective democratic governments and organized by the best minds of international law
lack the decorum of one federal court?
This is absolute provocation.
Since I've been the target,
I'm willing to abide by the ruling of a conference of judges.

And the September eighteen incident's direct organizer.

Only one escaped from war criminal depend on malinger.
a senior reporter say--
Ougawa is a craze adventurer, typical ruffian.
fancy of great empire filled with his brain.
After our discussion, the ten judges unanimously agreed with the second article of the Tribunal, specifying the Allies's Supreme Commander's ability to appoint judges to this court on the basis of recommendations from their respective national governments.
Therefore, we do not possess the power to decide appointment, dismissal, or withdrawal of any judge.
That means the guilt or innocence of the 28 defendants must be based on the final verdict of this military tribunal.
Next, we will hear the defendants' plea to the charges.
The 28 accused shall now state whether they plea guilty or not guilty to the charges the prosecution brought against them in the indictment of the lnternational Military Tribunal.
Defendant Sadao Araki, how do you plea, guilty or not guilty?
I petiton the court to let my lawyer answer the question.
Petition denied.
The court requires you to speak for yourself.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.
I'm not guilty.

I objected the indictment,

Japanese criminal defend team's vice leader,
Who was also Hideki Tojyo's attorney,
Named Hirose itiro,
Built a defend team composed of over one hundred people.
They used Long-term stratagem,
Never stop to make incident,
In order to throw the court into confusion,
Which made the trial get along.
It was no so bad as you thought,
I think we must win in first section,
Mr. Kinan and I have prepared two weapons,
They must recive applause.
The fish was finished,
Landlady,
Your Chinese was so perfect!

Hello
Gunni died.
Gunni died.
Gunni died.
It was your Chinese who killed Gunni.
Go away.

It is you who killed my brother.
Kitano's brother Gunni
Was sent to China together with Hideo,
Hideo came back Japan now,
But Gunni was died.
Kitano's animosity to Chinses,
Was increased by Gunni's death,
Which made us anxious.
In that time,
Tokyo was involved into the animosity,
Which was derived from the war to Chinese.
When was the beginning of the Japan-China war,
That was the most important point we concerned
On China in the Tokyo trial
After the Guandong Army entered the Northeast China,
Their frequently defiance action,
Made China-Japan relationship in this area tense up.
In the end, the China-Japan war began with
Guanggutun lncident, which was premeditated by Japan Army.
Mr. District attorney arbitrarily accused that the Huanggutun accident were the begining of the Japanese aggression towards China, it against the truth,
obviously, it also confused the partly conflict and formal war.
At the time, the Beijing government was the only Chinese government recognized by the international community and as such it had diplomatic relations with other countries.
And, Zhang Zuolin was the head of that government.
I would like to ask the defense, when one country plots and succeeds in the assassination of the head of another government, if that is not an act of war between the two countries, then what is it
Dose Mr. District attorney have any evidence to proof that
The Huanghutun accident was done by Japanese army?
This is a deposition given by the former
Japanese Navy Minister Keisuke Okada.
Mr. District attorney
How could we believe the words a navy officer said?
Then who could give evidence that these events took place?
Of course the lieutenant officer.

The war between Japan and China,
Just as the bust up between the brothers of the Asia Big Family.
Japan have no choice but to use some strong measure.
This is just as after the brother keep his temper for a long time he'll drive his little brother away.
This is in order to make China change his view.
Maybe our attitude was a little wildness,
But the original purpose was to do some good things,
The elder brother was loving the little brother.
And might I ask how the younger brother responded to his older brother's solicitude?
The little brother didn't understand our purpose.
He still didn't enjoy this love.
Don't talk about the Brothers any more!
Totally bullshit!
Bullshit!
In the last verdict of the international tribunal,
To the Nanjing Butcher in China,
This cognizance was made,
In the first six weeks of the Japanese aggression,
The number of innocent people who were butchered
Was over two hundred thousand.
This was the most discreet estimation
Of the international military tribunal.
The number Chinese government announced later
Made it clearly that
In Nanjing
There were three hundred thousand people were killed by Japanese Army.

Sakura was Fangzi's sister, she came back from China,
She joined battle service group for the enthusiasm of dedication to Japanese Army, but finally become sex tool for them.

Brother!
Brother!
It had been one year when I came to Tokyo,
Not only the Chinese government
But also l, the party judge,
Was never thought that
A legality trial
Which the winner country to the defeat country
Became so difficult and complex.
Here also has joy,
But not to me
It belong to other people
I'm just a visitor.
The criminals'individual defendance started,
What made the pressure of Mr.Xiang
Was the trial to
Doihara kenji and ltagaki siro.
These two criminals was the leader of
The Japanese-Chinese aggression.
Which made the Chinese people into pain and suffer.
If we were beaten by them in the court.
The result will not image.
The situation was that
Doihara kenji kept silence until the end.
He tried to get rid of the trial with the loophole of Common Law System
Itagaki siro was crankiness.
He wrote a 48-pages long apologia,
Said that he would fight with
The Chinese prosecution team.
Mr.Ni zhengao was the leader of this team,
He came Tokyo to help Mr.Mei.
For all of accusations.
My party-
Mr. Doihara denied all.
further more he also think that facing all accusation,
He absolutely think it scorn to argue with accuser.
therefore for a Japanese army's reverence
He gave up justification for themselves.
I denied all accusations.
Can Japanese government seeing the Northeast people
live in tribulation and scuffle?
We help them out of pity and friendship.
Is it the guilt?
Since I was charged of landtied officer.
I always persist in withdraw, peace, armistice.
whatever what accusal will be sentenced by prosecution team
I always be one of Japanese who love peace!
I'm not guilty.
You just said that the September 18 lncident, also known as the battle on September 18, 1931, was never premeditated, nor a conspiracy.
Is that correct?
Yes
However, you admitted earlier that the Kuandong Army did formulate a battle plan before the Huanggutun lncident.
Did you not agree to do it?
I have to explain this battle plan to you.
I don't want to hear your explanations!
My question is,
Did you report the battle plan to the central command, and did they approve it?
Yes
Then, how can you perpetuate your statement of no premeditation and conspiracy for the September 18 lncident?
Because comparing our Guangdong army with Chinese Northeast army, for military strength, we are in inferior position by 1 :20
Therefor we must prevent their attack.
we just self-defence.
How did you know the Northeast Army was going to attack you
We received some information,
After that we start making this plan.
The information on hand?
What information
Mr. Itagaki, don't forget you're in a courtroom.
Only the evidence matters.
So, if you are going to testify that the Northeast Army was about to launch an attack on the Japanese Army, then you have to provide proof.
In your defense brief, you stated that during the negotiations for the Three Power Accord between Japan, Germany and Italy you didn't advocate expanding the war.
In addition, when the Changgufeng lncident occurred on the border between China and the Soviet Union, you tirelessly sought a peaceful solution.
Is that right?
Yes
As a result, your emperor punished you for your actions.
Is that correct
Isn't that right?
How did you know this?
I'm the one asking questions here, not you.
Answer me, lsn't that right?
That's not true.
This document was found by the Chinese prosecution team in the archives of the Japanese Army lnternal Affairs Office.
It is a journal kept by Saionji and Harada.
It records in detail how the emperor severely reprimanded ltagaki for both these incidents.
And you have the nerve to deny this ever happened?
Your Honors, I now submit this evidence to the court.
please examine it and have it recorded.
Near the end of your term as minister of the army, you sent an emissary to China to meet with two individuals... the first premier of the Republic of China,
Tang Shaoyi, and the former head of the Northern Warlords, Wu Peifu
Is that correct?
Yes
Your emissary's purpose was to entice them to participate in a puppet organization you were trying to set up.
Is that right?
I don't know.
Well, do you at least remember whom you sent?
Was that person none other than the one who usurped the position of mayor of Shenyang, installed the puppet emperor Pu Yi, fraternized with the Japanese Kuandong Army, plotted to bring self-rule to North China, instigated the independence movement in lnner Mongolia,
incited traitors everywhere to set up puppet governments and traitorous organizations never hesitated to do evil, and now sits in the defendants' table, namely Kenji Dohihara?
Is that him?
Answer me.
This is the most brilliant victory of china's prosecution team
During the 10 days heckle with itagaki
Nizheng'ao rebuted and required those things
He mentioned in the refution.
Finally, by the method that approaching the topic indirectly,
He beat the Doihara who not say a word.
The war which was launched and enlarged by Hidekitogyo
Brought the Asia a very severe disaster,
Also, brought Japan a far-reaching secret anguish.
This secret anguish,
Pervaded several decades after the war finished,
Makes the young of that age full of
Being at sea, despair and even crazy,
The pain of lose destroy many people's spirit
At the very beginning, the holy war to the Asia Paciffic,
And the worship to Hidekitogyo
To where should Japan go?
During the time that the young of Japan thinking of the question,
Also worry about their own's destiny and future.
War is just like a beast, who licked up
life, honor and country,
As well as blood and ideal.
Thank you.
Japanese people are all good people,
But why they all had blind faith to the emperor?
So why the Chinese people had blind faith to the Huangdi?
But why the emperor had to start a war?
So why Chengjisihan had to crusage towards to the west?
Why your Tang Empery start war in Chinese western areas,
And fight broad to Korea?
Emperors all want to start wars.
So we must send revolutions.
Revolution?
Miss Chiba
What happened?
What happened?
Miss Chiba
Help!
Hurry!
Help!
This became a unsettled case in the end,
The killer was not found.
From that day,
Xiaonan and I had never went there.
any more.
The trial to Hideki Tojyo
Would be another fierce fight.
At that time, different public voices came up all over the world.
There was request of judging the emperor again.
It was a controversial issue in judges's meetings.
But after the secret discussion between MacArthur and the emperor,
The issue was left unsettled.
Later on, Sir William showed his standpoint of not charging the emperor and the imperial family.
Brother, I wanner go to eat noodle.
Welcome.
This way please.
YingZi, go and serve the customers.
Welcome.
Give me a bowl of noodle and a bunch of fish.

What happiness.
Dong Tiao government called 100 million citizens to go into battle.
The temporary council passed 3800 million Yen according to the request of Prime Misinter Dong Tiao.

Next, my party will readout his affidavit.
finally, maybe this is the last opportunity on the court permit.
I would like to repeat here.
Japanese empire's national policy
The policy was pursued by the officer who occupy the position legally at that year.
Not aggression and not exploitation
We just pursued according to constitution and law regulation.
But still met the rigorous reality.
We took the national fate to be ante, but we lost
I insisted on that this was a war of self-defence.
Not a war of disobeying the lnternational Law.
About the responsibility of the war's failure
This is my fault.
It means that I'll take on all of the responsibility.
Hideki toujyou.
19th, Dec, Syouwa 22 year, Tokyo.
Now, according to your reasoning, on the one hand you carried out peaceful negotiations between Japan and China, but on the other you occupied China with a powerful military force.
Aren't those two contradictory?
They didn't contradictory any more.
Did you ever contemplate that the invasion of Manchuria might turn the Chinese public against Japan?
Chinese public antipathy against Japan was existing long before.
But Japan have never aggressed China.
Silence!
How many people did the Japanese Army kill?
I don't know.
This document was published by the Japanese lmperial General Headquarters
It reports that between the period July 1937 and June 1941, the Japanese Army killed two million and fifteen thousand Chinese people...
Isn't it logical that must slaughtering two million Chinese lives could rouse the fury of the Chinese people?
Please answer the question.
I also think it was a misfortune.
Many of those you butchered were innocent civilians.
Why was the treatment to these non-involved innocent civilians so atrocious?
What is called there is no relation between people and war
China is same as we Japan.
As the captain of China regime, direct people to oppugn Japan and insult Japan.
so draw on killing.
this is the wrong of China regime.
no relation to us.
So I insist donot withdraw from China.
Further more keep extending the war.
Is it right?
I don't like answer yes or no.
This is a courtroom.
Your wants are irrelevant and an answer is mandatory.
So, yes or no
Object
The procurator didn't have right to ask like that.
Objection overruled!
The witness must answer the prosecutor's question with yes or no.
Answer me!
Yes or no?
No
No?
Did Japan evacuate troops from China after you received instructions to form a cabinet in October 1941?
No, but that was
You already answered my question.
I don't need an explanation.
In your statement, you said that Japan's decision to go to war with the United States,
Britain and Holland which was the direct result for those countries freezing Japan assets on July 26, 1941, correct?
Yes
You already told the court that the emperor loves peace, didn't you
Yes
Furthermore, no Japanese official or commoner would dare to disobey the emperor's orders, is that correct?
What I said was a national sensibility,
That was different from the Emperor's responsibility.
But as a matter of fact, did you not initiate hostilities against the United States, Britain and the Netherland?
That was decision of our council.
If the emperor opposed the war, would it still have happened?
I have already said lots of times that the Emperor didn't have any responsibility,
Japan had no choice but initiate the war.
Do you think initiating hostilities is morally and legally acceptable?
I think it is acceptable, whenever past now and future,
I still think it is acceptable.
So if you and your colleagues were acquitted,
You would go out and do it all over again?
You would continue to allow Japan to launch invasions and start wars?
Yes
Dear honours, the procecution'd like to announce that we've completed our cross examination of Hideki Tojyo
YingZi
All be sitted.
The 817th session of lnternational Military Tribunal for the Far East is now in session.
Next, the prosecution will make its closing argument.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Honorable judges, and members of the court... all of the accused, joined in a formulation and execution of a plan a conspiracy whose publish was to establish Japan's military, political, and economic domination over the countries
within the Pacific and Indian Oceans!
In order to achieve this goal,
Japan alone or working with liked minds,
embarked on a war of aggression to subjugate all who stood in its way.
My prosecution team and I have produced more than enough evidence to prove the participation of the accused in the above summarized criminal actions.
Throughout the history of civilization, no one has ever seen such a peak of cruelty and barbarity.
Countless people died horrendous, unthinkable deaths to feed Japan's insatiable appetite for domination.
By their actions, they have challenged human civilization, challenged peace, and challenged the whole world!
Their mutual delict intent.
in order to be sure the reign position of Japanese king.
No worth guilt than start the aggression battle.
the safe of all world people be threatened by this intrigue.
be wrecked by the war only result of the intrigue.
is taking world people to undergo dead and pain
Therefore, I, Joseph Keenan, on behalf of my colleagues on the Allied prosecution team, solemnly request the honorable judges of the lnternational Military Tribunal for the Far East to severely punish those responsible for this horrible war of aggression,
in the honor of justice in the spirit of compassion, and in the honor of humanity.
The presentation of the cases before the lnternational Military Tribunal for the Far East is now concluded.
The verdict will be announced after the judges' final deliberations.
Until that time, the court is in recess.

Far east international military tribunal entered the final stage.
judgers from 1 1 countries have huge difference for the judgement.
and appeared opposed emotions.
especially for the Hidekitojyo and other 24 criminals.
on the question if judge them gallows
Occurred feud.
is it the problem that how to condemn?
a reporter of English Times News, whose forecast is very surprise
on the problem whether use death penalty
He said, there are 2 splits among eleven countries.
further more it is the most number which disagree with dead penalty... do not ask me any more.
I can say nothing to you.
people cannot identify the devilishness of the war and crime, until suffer the harm
I have never regret, but today...
I regretted.
chose to come to Japan.
Thinking of Xiangyu's tragedy, I want to commit suicide.
Mei, you want to learn XiangYu?
And do you want to die?
if you died, then the judger could stand by you.
could punish the war criminal you could jump down from the window,
I do not hold you.
Do you think you can help by doing so?
Bullshit.
I think you are probably a coward.
do you think you can move god, depend upon your emotion?
do you think the judgers will stand by you, depend upon your temper and your complaint?
action, show me your action!
there is a logion in Hunan as long as you can not fight me died, I will stand up!
I will stand up.
If no one has anything new to add, we can begin voting...
Alright, since no one has anything left to contribute,
let's get started.
Sir William, would I say a few more things before we start voting?
Of course
Thank you
Please give me a glass of water
We all agree that the criminals are guilty.
But we cannot agree if they should be hanged for what they did.
A lot of innocent people died for the war.
They can only rest in peace when these criminals are punished by the death penalty.
Mr. Bernard your objection to the death penalty is because you believe a civilized country should have abolished the death penalty.
Am I right?
absolutely right
In general, I agree with you but in this case, I have my doubts...
Mei, I'd be happy to discuss it
According to your logic, civilization should be respected but what about life?
Shouldn't life be respected?
I don't think I need to answer that question
You should already know the answer perfectly well
I'm sure you wouldn't deny the preciousness of life because everyone only lives once
Because everyone has one life.
Suppose this cup represents humanity and the water representscivilization
Please excuse my crudeness
Civilization is created by human being
If people were ruthlessly murdered, how can we talk about civilization
Mr. Bernard
Mei, pls.
Seat down.
Mei, you want to discuss Buddhism with me
I don't know a lot about Buddhism but I have a great deal of respect for it... when I was a child, I learned from my parents
I've known that Buddhism encourages people to do good and avoid doing evil.
Correct?
That's a fundamental idea
Besides the teachings to promoting goodness, isn't there also punishment of the evil
Yes.
But Buddhism says that punishment is carried out the next life.
You mean if someone does evil in this lifetime, he'll pay for it in the next.
Right?
That's right
But who will prevent the crime this lifetime?
Could Buddha prevent Japan not to start wars again?
Dose Hideki Tojyo believe Buddha?
Buddha will help him believe
Buddha will love him and forgive him for everything he's done.
In the end, Buddha will embrace everyone
That's how his power works we are side with Buddha hoping that in the future, there are no war anymore.
No crime or evil.
But expectation in spirit can affect what's happen in realism.
Those unbearable ugliness and trample on humanity
I don't have any doubts about the power of Buddha,
But I doubt that if the people can reach light under the direction of Buddha.
Buddha says believe makes the dream come true,
But what if these criminals do not believe in Buddha at all?
I agree to the ancient Greeks' proverb
What god has will belong to him at last.
Mr. Pal
Why we come to here, the judges from 1 1 countries, have come to Japan, for what?
so we msut punish the criminals according to law.
Mei, don't try to persuade me anymore
I still think my viewpoint is correct.
Mr. Pal, I won't try to persuade you any further
The ancient Greeks had a proverb
Fate sees the world more properly than we do
I can see that I'm next.
Please...
Lao Wei, my dear judger
All of you here are legal experts from all over the world
I want to ask you what is law and what is the function of it
Throughout the 817th long tribunal between the two years,
We finally confirm that they are guilty
But now we were talking about the civilization and the religion
Gentlemen,
This is not classroom of collage,
This is not temper
This is court!
What we need to talk about is how to punish the criminals
I think the role of religion is to tell people what can be done, to tell people to do good and to forgive.
On the other hand,
Law prescribes what cannot be done.
Otherwise, you will be punished by law.
You will have to go to the guillotine and the scaffold.
This is law
This is why I insist on imposing the death penalty on the war criminals
Besides robbing the resource of other countries and expanding his territory
Japan also killed thousands of innocent people
Japanese army's plundering raping backfiring and killing,
They had killed numerous innocent people- the Chinese, the Koreans, the Filipinos, the Singaporeans, the Americans, the Englishmen...
These crimes are not enough to bring them to justice
If neither Japan nor the war criminals receive the severest punishment who can assure that they will never wage war again?
Who can assure that Japan will never invade other countries?
Who can assure that the Japanese militaristic spirit will never revive?
anyone of you here is able to make an assurance like this
What I wanted to say, what I should've said, it's done
We can vote now for all those who died in the war... for closing eyes in death pls.
Think it over.
They are watching us, watching the pens we hold in our hands...
No for the death penalty
No
Yes for the death penalty
No
No
Yes
No
Yes
Yes
Yes
Gentleman as you see this 5 to 5
This is the last ballot...
This one last ballot will decide everything
Yes
I will now read the verdict... the court believes that there is no need to consider whether or not the accused are guilty of the conspiracy to violate treaties and accords Japan had with other countries because charge of executing a plot along with other countries to wage an aggressive war
is already the gravest crime one can commit.
The court finds all the Japanese defendants guilty as charged!
international military tribunal concluded,
In the end, seven criminals were punished to death.
until now, I can't call to mind, on this morning, if the judges who agreed death sentence were not reach six, what will happen to me what will happen to all the Chinese people what will happen to the whole world
otherwise, all the judges had pledged in the beginning we would never disclose that who agree the death sentence and who not agree, what I what to say was that
I have tried my best...
