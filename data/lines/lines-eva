Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
-What's in this?
-Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
... buttheydid.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food...
... butthisElvishstuff,it's notbad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
... haven'tyou,Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears...
... toservethemaster of the precious.
We will swear on...
... ontheprecious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes...
... ontheprecious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
-Get down!
I said, down!
-Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
-Leave him alone!
-Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
-You're hurt.
-l'm fine.
-lt was just an act.
-An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world Is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...
... andMordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...
... andtheunionofthetwotowers?
Together, my Lord Sauron...
... weshallrulethis MIddle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
... andtheIronfistsofthe Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
-Burn it.
-Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord...
... Isreadyto fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
-Mordor will pay for this.
-These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...
... yourwarmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...
... andallitsdomains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further...
... untilwe 'vehadabreather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
... andcomealive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper...
... talktoeachother...
... evenmove.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful...
... abitof theflank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan...
... whatnewsfromthe Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...
... ifitstoodbut alittlehigher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...
... andclaimedlordshipovertheselands .
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say...
... asanoldman hoodedandcloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle...
... intoFangornForest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side...
... becausenobody'son my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
-Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
-No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are...
... andmaybeyouaren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it. I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place. lt's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us...
... itneverletsgo.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
... andlightlittlecandles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon Is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
-l thought they were dead.
-Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
... andanger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire...
... andwater.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
... I foughtwiththe Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy...
... andsmotehis ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me...
... andIstrayedoutofthought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead...
... andeveryday was aslong as a life age of the Earth.
But It was not the end.
I felt life In me again.
I've been sent back...
... untilmy taskisdone .
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now...
... attheturnofthetide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
-We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
-Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...
... inthishorrid,dark,dank tree-infested--?
I mean, charming...
... quitecharmingforest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones...
... thatstartsan avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
-... andfindthattheyarestrong.
-Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas...
... unlessmy eyesare cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses...
... andhasbeenmyfriend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
-ls it much further?
-Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest...
... neartherootsofthemountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where l'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind Is In the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land Is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge...
... forRohanis weakand readytofall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning...
... wehaveoneadvantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it...
... hasnotyet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor...
... inthehandsofa Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed...
... andthesecrecyofhisquest .
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
-l do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-l know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
-Now!
-No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path...
... andsomestairs.
And then...
... atunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then...
... youweresick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.
You're taller.
-Who?
-You!
-Than what?
-Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
-l want some!
-lt could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
-Are there Ent children?
-Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
-Why is that?
-We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
-How did they die?
-Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...
... whosemindIsoverthrown.
Saruman 's hold over king Théoden Is now very strong.
My lord, your son...
... heis dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king...
... tolosehisonlysonandheir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
... inthebitterwatchesofthenight...
... whenallyourlifeseemstoshrink .
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring...
... stillclingingto winter'schill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
... ThéodenKing.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
... GandalfStormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour...
... inwhichthisconjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
iii news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death...
... tobandycrookedwords with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden...
... sonofThengel...
... toolonghaveyou sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you...
... fromthespell.
You have no power here...
... GandalftheGrey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me...
... youwillnotkillhim.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
... iftheygraspedyoursword.
I've only...
... everservedyou,mylord .
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live...
... toseethelastdays ofmy house .
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me...
... butI willnotbringfurtherdeath to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
... Théoden,notAragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king...
... thecitymustempty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves...
... butI didnotlookforit in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell...
... fora time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
-... washefromGondor?
-No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found lsildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings...
... ashieldmaidenof Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep...
... thegreatfortressofRohan.
It Is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
-Why do you do that?
-What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him...
... whatit'sstilldoingtohim.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
-You have to fight it.
-l know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening. I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now...
... andnevercomeback.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will...
... behavinglikethat.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw...
... andwriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is...
... wherehecamefrom.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there...
... inpeace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance...
... thatthey'reoftenmistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...
... thattherearenoDwarfwomen ...
... andthatDwarvesjustspringout of holes in the ground...
... whichis,of course,ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
-lt's good.
-Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It Is mine to give to whom I will.
LIke my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen... .
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here Is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
-Háma?
-l'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
-What is it?
What do you see?
-Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here. I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
-l can fight.
-No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
-Forward. I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!
-That's it!
Go on!
-Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's...
... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
-Mama!
-Éothain!
Freda!
-Where is the rest?
-This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn...
... whereishe ?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall Is solid rock...
... butforasmallculvert at Its base...
... whichIs littlemorethan adrain .
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning...
... thousands,tostormthe Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night...
... thelandwillbestained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising...
... fromIsengardthesedays.
Isengard?
There was a time...
... whenSarumanwouldwalkinmy woods .
But now he has a mind of metal...
... andwheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...
... andallthatyou hopefor comes true...
... youwillstillhavetotaste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
... Aragornwilldie.
And there will be no comfort for you...
... nocomforttoease thepain of his passing.
He will come to death...
... anImageofthesplendor of the kings of Men...
... Ingloryundimmedbefore the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter...
... youwilllingeronIndarkness and In doubt...
... asnightfallInwinter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell...
... boundto yourgrief under the fading trees...
... untilallthe worldIschanged...
... andthelongyearsofyourlife are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here...
... onlydeath.
The power of the enemy Is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...
... todestroythe peopleofRohan .
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...
... thelastfreekingdomofMen .
his war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the ring Is close.
The strength of the RIng-bearer Is falling.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...
... thequestwillclaimhislife.
You know this.
You have foreseen It.
It Is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find Its way back Into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by Its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...
... taketheringforhisown, and the world will fall.
It Is close now.
So close to achieving Its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth...
... evenuntototheending of the world.
The time of the Elves...
... Isover.
Do we leave MIddle-earth to Its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
-How many?
-Some thousands.
More come every day.
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria...
... twoweremy kin...
... aDwarftherewas also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
-He loves you, Father.
-Do not trouble me with Faramir...
... I knowhisuses,andtheyarefew .
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
-lsildur's Bane.
-lt has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
-Gondor.
-lt's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
-Would you deny your own father?
-lf there is need to go to Rivendell...
-... sendmein hisstead.
-You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please...
... letmego downtohim.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but... .
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on...
... he'llfindme.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo... .
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you...
... twoHalflings...
... anda hostof menatmycall.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...
... toshowhisquality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please. it's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
-He's alive!
-Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest...
... andthemostrecklessman I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
-All lsengard is emptied.
-How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...
... tobereadyfor battlebynightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...
... orsetfootinsidetheHornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown...
... homesrebuilt.
Within these walls...
... wewilloutlastthem.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people...
... downtothelastchild.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end...
... astobe worthyofremembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon--?
No, my Lord Aragorn...
... wearealone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions-- There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled...
... aboutthewarsofMenandwizards...
... fora verylongtime.
But now, something is about to happen...
... thathasnothappened...
... foranage.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents...
... willgoto war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
-Let me stand at your side.
-lt is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I , Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord...
... willfollowyoutowhateverend.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
LIke wind In the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West...
... behindthehills...
... IntoShadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying...
... goodmorning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma...
... thereisalwayshope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
-What's happening out there?
-Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
-Fire!
-Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 1 7!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot...
... andwehaveagreed...
... youarenotOrcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit...
... ittakesalongtime ...
... tosayanythinginOldEntish...
... andweneversay anything...
... unlessit is worthtaking...
... alongtimetosay.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
is this it?
is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread...
... andthewoodsofTuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And... .
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
-What?
-l cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
-Fall back!
-Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
-Turn around.
Take us south.
-South?
But that will lead you past lsengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then...
... youareverysmall.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please...
... letmego .
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice...
... thatclimbup sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they... .
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
... Entishor thetonguesofMen...
... forthistreachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight...
... withrockandstone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely...
... thatwego to ourdoom.
Last march...
... oftheEnts.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn...
... lookto theeast.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...
... shallsoundin theDeep...
... onelasttime.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath...
... nowforruinanda red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...
... becausehowcouldthe end behappy?
How could the world go back to the way It was...
... whenso muchbad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But In the end, It's only a passing thing...
... thisshadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, It will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you...
... thatmeantsomething.
Even If you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories...
... hadlotsofchancesofturningback, only they didn't.
They kept going...
... becausetheywereholding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
-... 42.
-Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
-Forty-three.
-He was already dead.
-He was twitching.
-He was twitching...
... becausehe'sgotmyax embedded in his nervous system!
-He doesn't look too happy, does he?
-Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes. lt's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.
-The world's back to normal, that's all.
-No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
-lt is!
-Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir...
... youhaveshownyourquality,sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...
... wheregardenersareheldinhighhonor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path...
... nearMinasMorgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
-ls that its name?
-No.
No!
-Yes.
-Frodo...
... theysayadarkterrordwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
-You cannot go that way.
-lt is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
-Forgive and forget.
-No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
-Nice Hobbits.
-Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...
... somewhereIn thewilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?" "Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I .
"Samwise the Brave. "
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious...
... andwebe themaster!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky. lt's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
-Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
-Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war... grief... despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quicky, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
South Farthing
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
The world is changed.
I feel it in the water.
I feel it in the earth.
I smell it in the air.
Much that once was is lost.
For none now live who remember it.
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
Three were given to the Elves.
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
Seven to the Dwarf-lords.
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
And nine nine rings were gifted to the race of Men who, above all else, desire power.
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
But they were all of them deceived.
For another ring was made.
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring to control all others.
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.
One Ring to rule them all.
One by one the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring.
But there were some who resisted.
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.
Victory was near.
But the power of the Ring could not be undone.
It was in this moment when all hope had faded that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword.
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated.
The Ring passed to Isildur who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.
But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted.
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
It betrayed Isildur to his death.
And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.
History became legend legend became myth.
And for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of all knowledge.
Until, when chance came it ensnared a new bearer.
My precious.
The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.
And there it consumed him.
It came to me.
My own.
My love.
My own.
My precious.
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East whispers of a nameless fear.
And the Ring of Power perceived its time had now come.
It abandoned Gollum.
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.
What's this?
A Hobbit.
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
A ring.
Lost!
My precious is lost!
For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.
The 22nd day of September in the year 1400 by Shire-reckoning.
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West farthing the Shire Middle-earth.
The Third Age of this world.
There and Back Again:
A Hobbit's Tale.
By Bilbo Baggins.
Now where to begin?
Ah, yes...
"Concerning Hobbits."
Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk.
Middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count Hobbits must seem of little importance being neither renowned as great warriors nor counted among the very wise.
Frodo!
Someone at the door.
In fact, it has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.
A rather unfair observation as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales and the smoking of pipe-weed.
But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet and good, tilled earth.
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.
And, yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint.
But today of all days, it is brought home to me.:
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.
Frodo, the door!
Sticklebacks.
Where is that boy?
Frodo!
Down from the door where it began.
And I must follow if I can.
The road goes ever on and on.
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the road has gone.
And I must follow if I can You're late.
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
How is the old rascal?
I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence.
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.
Well, that should please him.
Half the Shire's been invited.
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
And so life in the Shire goes on very much as it has this past Age full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly.
If it comes at all.
For things are made to endure in the Shire passing from one generation to the next.
There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill in Bag End.
And there always will be.
To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.
I mean, more than usual.
He's taken to locking himself in his study.
He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.
Where's it gone?
He's up to something.
All right, then.
Keep your secrets.
What?
But I know you have something to do with it.
Good gracious me.
Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of.
Indeed.
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved.
All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
Oh, really?
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!
Gandalf?
I'm glad you're back.
So am I, dear boy.
So am I.
No, thank you!
We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!
And what about very old friends?
Gandalf?
Bilbo Baggins.
My dear Gandalf!
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?
You haven't aged a day.
Come on, come in!
Welcome, welcome.
Oh, here we are.
Tea?
Or maybe something a little stronger?
I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1296.
Very good year.
Almost as old as I am.
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?
Just tea, thank you.
I was expecting you sometime last week.
Not that it matters.
You come and go as you please.
Always have and always will.
You caught me a bit unprepared.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart...
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.
I've just found some sponge cake.
I could make you some eggs if you'd...
Just tea, thank you.
Oh, right.
You don't mind if I eat, do you?
No, not at all.
Bilbo!
Bilbo Baggins!
I'm not at home!
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.
I know you're in there!
They're after the house.
They've never forgiven me for living this long.
I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day never giving me a moment's peace.
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book.
Oh, tea.
So you mean to go through with your plan?
Yes, yes.
It's all in hand.
All the arrangements are made.
Oh, thank you.
Frodo suspects something.
Of course he does.
He's a Baggins not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
You will tell him, won't you?
Yes, yes.
He's very fond of you.
I know.
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.
I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire.
The woods, the fields.
Little rivers.
I am old, Gandalf.
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.
I feel thin.
Sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread.
I need a holiday.
A very long holiday.
And I don't expect I shall return.
In fact, I mean not to.
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the South farthing.
Gandalf, my old friend this will be a night to remember.
Hello, hello.
Fatty Bolger.
Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Go on, Sam.
Ask Rosie for a dance.
I think I'll just have another ale.
Oh, no, you don't.
Go on!
So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.
And they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us.
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly.
They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees and turned them all to stone!
Quickly.
Up they go!
No, the big one.
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Are all these children yours?
Good gracious, you have been productive.
Bilbo?
Sackville-Bagginses!
Quickly, hide!
Thank you, my boy.
You're a good lad, Frodo.
I'm very selfish, you know.
Yes, I am.
Very selfish.
I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died but it wasn't out of charity.
I think it was because of all my numerous relations you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?
No.
Well, yes, but that's not the point.
The point is, Frodo you'll be all right.
Done!
You're supposed to stick it in the ground.
It is in the ground.
Outside!
This was your idea.
Bilbo.
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!
Nonsense.
There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.
That was good.
Let's get another one.
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might've known.
Speech, Bilbo!
Speech!
Speech!
My dear Bagginses and Boffins Tooks and Brandybucks Grubbs, Chubbs Hornblowers Bolgers Bracegirdles and Proudfoots.
Proudfeet!
Today is my 111th birthday!
Happy birthday!
But alas, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits.
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
I have things to do.
I've put this off far too long.
I regret to announce this is the end!
I'm going now.
I bid you all a very fond farewell.
Goodbye.
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?
There are many magic rings in this world, and none of them should be used lightly.
It was just a bit of fun.
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
Two eyes.
As often as I can spare them.
I'm leaving everything to him.
What about this ring of yours?
Is that staying too?
Yes, yes.
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.
No.
Wait, it's here in my pocket.
Isn't that...?
Isn't that odd, now?
Yet, after all, why not?
Why shouldn't I keep it?
I think you should leave the ring behind.
Is that so hard?
Well, no.
And yes.
Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it.
It's mine.
I found it!
It came to me!
There's no need to get angry.
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!
It's mine.
My own.
My precious.
Precious?
It's been called that before, but not by you.
What business is it of yours what I do with my own things?
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
You want it for yourself!
Bilbo Baggins!
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.
I am not trying to rob you.
I'm trying to help you.
All your long years, we've been friends.
Trust me as you once did.
Let it go.
You're right, Gandalf.
The ring must go to Frodo.
It's late.
The road is long.
Yes, it is time.
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.
I've thought up an ending for my book:
"And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.
Goodbye, Gandalf.
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.
The road goes ever on and on.
Until our next meeting.
It's mine.
My own.
My precious.
Riddles in the dark.
Bilbo!
Bilbo!
My precious.
Precious.
He's gone, hasn't he?
He talked for so long about leaving I didn't think he'd really do it.
Gandalf?
Bilbo's ring.
He's gone to stay with the Elves.
He's left you Bag End.
Along with all his possessions.
The ring is yours now.
Put it somewhere out of sight.
Where are you going?
There are some things that I must see to.
What things?
Questions.
Questions that need answering.
You've only just arrived.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
Keep it secret.
Keep it safe.
Shire!
Baggins!
"The year 3434 of the Second Age."
"Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor..."
"...and the finding of the Ring of Power."
"It has come to me."
"The One Ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom."
"All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate..."
"...for I will risk no hurt to the Ring."
"It is precious to me..."
...though I buy it with great pain.
"The markings upon the band begin to fade."
"The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared."
"A secret now that only fire can tell."
Shire.
Baggins.
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.
That way.
To heal my heart and drown my woe.
Rain may fall and wind may blow.
But there still be.
Many miles to go.
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain.
And the stream that falls From hill to plain.
Better than rain or rippling brook.
Is a mug of beer inside this Took.
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.
War is brewing.
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.
Far-off tales and children's stories, that's all that is.
You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins.
Cracked, he was.
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.
And proud of it.
Cheers, Gaffer.
Cheers.
It's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders.
Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you.
Good night, lads.
Good night.
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.
Mind who you're sweet-talking.
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.
Does she?
Good night, Sam.
Good night, Mister Frodo.
Is it secret?
Is it safe?
What are you doing?
Hold out your hand, Frodo.
It's quite cool.
What can you see?
Can you see anything?
Nothing.
There's nothing.
Wait.
There are markings.
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.
There are few who can.
The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
Mordor!
In the common tongue, it says:
"One Ring to rule them all One Ring to find them One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."
This is the One Ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
Bilbo found it.
In Gollum's cave.
Yes.
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping prolonging his life, delaying old age.
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.
The Ring has awoken.
It's heard its master's call.
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.
No, Frodo.
The spirit of Sauron endured.
His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived.
Sauron has returned.
His Orcs have multiplied.
His fortress at Barad-dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.
He is seeking it.
Seeking it.
All his thought is bent on it.
For the Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master.
They are one the Ring and the Dark Lord.
Frodo he must never find it.
All right.
We put it away.
We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.
No one knows it's here, do they?
Do they, Gandalf?
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.
But the enemy found him first.
I don't know how long they tortured him.
But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words:
Shire!
Baggins!
Shire.
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!
Who goes there?
Take it, Gandalf!
Take it!
No, Frodo.
You must take it!
You cannot offer me this ring!
I'm giving it to you!
Don't tempt me, Frodo!
I dare not take it.
Not even to keep it safe.
Understand, Frodo I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.
But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
But it cannot stay in the Shire!
No.
No, it can't.
What must I do?
You must leave.
And leave quickly.
Where?
Where do I go?
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.
Bree.
What about you?
I'll be waiting for you at the inn of the Prancing Pony.
And the Ring will be safe there?
I don't know, Frodo.
I don't have any answers.
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful.
Trust me, Frodo.
He'll know what to do.
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is not safe outside the Shire.
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.
I can cut across country easily enough.
My dear Frodo.
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.
You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.
And yet, after a hundred years they can still surprise you.
Get down.
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?
I haven't been dropping no eaves.
Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?
I heard raised voices.
What did you hear?
Speak!
Nothing important.
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.
No?
Perhaps not.
I've thought of a better use for you.
Come along, Samwise.
Keep up.
Be careful, both of you.
The enemy has many spies in his service:
Birds, beasts.
Is it safe?
Never put it on for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.
Always remember, Frodo the Ring is trying to get back to its master.
It wants to be found.
This is it.
This is what?
If I take one more step it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
Come on, Sam.
Remember what Bilbo used to say:
"It's a dangerous business, Frodo." "Going out your door.
You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."
Sam.
Wood-elves.
They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers.
To the Grey Havens.
They're leaving Middle-earth.
Never to return.
I don't know why it makes me sad.
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back.
Just shut your eyes and imagine you're back in your own bed with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.
Me neither, Sam.
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.
The hour grows late.
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel.
For that is why you have come, is it not?
My old friend.
Saruman.
You are sure of this?
Beyond any doubt.
So the Ring of Power has been found.
All these long years, it was in the Shire.
Under my very nose.
Yet you did not have the wit to see it.
Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
Time?
What time do you think we have?
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.
He cannot yet take physical form but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
The Eye of Sauron.
He is gathering all evil to him.
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.
You know this?
How?
I have seen it.
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
Why?
Why should we fear to use it?
They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing-stones.
We do not know who else may be watching.
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron's forces are already moving.
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
The Nine?
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve disguised as riders in black.
They've reached the Shire?
They will find the Ring.
And kill the one who carries it.
Frodo!
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.
Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory.
We must join with him, Gandalf.
We must join with Sauron.
It would be wise, my friend.
Tell me friend when did Saruman and the Wise abandon reason for madness?
I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly but you have elected the way of pain!
Mr. Frodo?
Frodo?
Frodo!
I thought I'd lost you.
What are you talking about?
It's just something Gandalf said.
What did he say?
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee." And I don't mean to.
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?
Frodo.
Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
Hello, Frodo.
Get off him.
Come on, Frodo.
What's the meaning of this?
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
You get back here!
Get out of my field!
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.
And some cabbages.
And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.
And then the mushrooms the week before.
Yes, Pippin.
My point is he's clearly overreacting.
Run!
Oh, that was close.
I think I've broken something.
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!
What?
That was just a detour.
A short cut.
Short cut to what?
Mushrooms!
That's mine.
That's nice, Merry.
Here's a nice one, Sam.
I think we should get off the road.
Get off the road!
Quick!
Be quiet!
What was that?
Anything?
Nothing.
What is going on?
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.
Frodo?
Get down!
I have to leave the Shire.
Sam and I must get to Bree.
Right.
Bucklebury Ferry.
Follow me.
Run!
This way!
Follow me!
Run!
Get the rope, Sam!
Frodo!
Run, Frodo!
Go!
Hurry!
Frodo, come on!
Come on!
Faster!
Jump!
How far to the nearest crossing?
The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.
Come on.
What do you want?
We're heading for the Prancing Pony.
Hobbits.
Four Hobbits!
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.
It's my job to ask questions after night fall.
There's talk of strange folk abroad.
Can't be too careful.
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.
Excuse me.
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?
If you're seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.
Always proud to cater to the Little Folk, Mister...?
Underhill.
My name's Underhill.
UnderhiII, yes.
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.
Can you tell him we've arrived?
Gandalf?
Gandalf.
Oh, yes I remember.
Elderly chap.
Big grey beard, pointy hat.
Not seen him for six months.
What do we do now?
Sam he'll be here.
He'll come.
Get out of my way!
What's that?
This, my friend, is a pint.
It comes in pints?
I'm getting one.
You got a whole half already!
That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.
Excuse me.
That Man in the corner.
Who is he?
He's one of them Rangers.
They're dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.
What his right name is, I've never heard, but around here he's known as Strider.
Strider.
Baggins.
Baggins.
Baggins?
Sure, I know a Baggins.
He's over there.
Frodo Baggins.
He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side and my third cousin, twice removed...
Pippin!
Steady on, Frodo.
You cannot hide.
I see you.
There is no life in the void.
Only death.
You draw far too much attention to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."
What do you want?
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.
I carry nothing.
Indeed.
I can avoid being seen if I wish but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.
Who are you?
Are you frightened?
Yes.
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.
They're coming.
What are they?
They were once Men.
Great kings of Men.
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.
Blinded by their greed, they took them without question.
One by one, falling into darkness.
Now they are slaves to his will.
They are the Nazgul.
Ringwraiths.
Neither living nor dead.
At all times they feel the presence of the Ring drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.
Where are you taking us?
Into the Wild.
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer and feel fouler.
He's foul enough.
We have no choice but to trust him.
But where is he leading us?
To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.
To the house of Elrond.
Did you hear that?
Rivendell.
We're going to see the Elves.
Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
What about breakfast?
You've already had it.
We've had one, yes.
What about second breakfast?
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.
What about elevenses?
Luncheon?
Afternoon tea?
Dinner?
Supper?
He knows about them, doesn't he?
I wouldn't count on it.
Pippin!
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?
Who is she?
This woman you sing of.
'Tis the lady of Luthien.
The Elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal.
What happened to her?
She died.
Get some sleep, Frodo.
The power of Isengard is at your command Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?
We have work to do.
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.
Rip them all down.
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sul.
We shall rest here tonight.
These are for you.
Keep them close.
I'm going to have a look around.
Stay here.
My tomato's burst.
Could I have some bacon?
Want a tomato, Sam?
What are you doing?
!
Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.
We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
Put it out, you fools!
Put it out!
That's nice!
Ash on my tomatoes!
Go!
Back, you devils!
Frodo!
Oh, Sam.
Strider!
Help him, Strider.
He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.
Hurry!
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!
Hold on, Frodo.
Gandalf!
Look, Frodo.
It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.
Mr. Frodo?
He's going cold.
Is he going to die?
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.
They're close.
Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?
Athelas?
Kingsfoil.
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?
Frodo.
Who is she?
Frodo.
She's an Elf.
He's fading.
He's not going to last.
We must get him to my father.
I've been looking for you for two days.
Where are you taking him?
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.
Stay with the Hobbits
- I'll send horses for you.
I'm the faster rider
- I'll take him.
The Road is too dangerous.
What are they saying?
If I can get across the river the power of my people will protect him.
I do not fear them.
Arwen ride hard.
Don't look back.
What are you doing?
!
Those Wraiths are still out there!
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.
If you want him, come and claim him.
No.
No!
Frodo, no.
Frodo, don't give in.
Not now.
What grace is given me let it pass to him.
Let him be spared.
Save him.
Where am I?
You are in the house of Elrond.
And it is 10:00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know.
Gandalf!
Yes, I'm here.
And you're lucky to be here too.
A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.
But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
What happened, Gandalf?
Why didn't you meet us?
I am sorry, Frodo.
I was delayed.
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.
Embrace the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction!
There is only one Lord of the Ring.
Only one who can bend it to his will.
And he does not share power.
So you have chosen death.
Gandalf?
What is it?
Nothing, Frodo.
Frodo!
Sam.
Bless you, you're awake!
Sam has hardly left your side.
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
Bilbo!
Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Bilbo.
"There and Back Again:
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."
This is wonderful.
I meant to go back wonder at the powers of Mirkwood visit Lake-town see the Lonely Mountain again.
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
I miss the Shire.
I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else.
Off with you, on one of your adventures.
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.
I'm not like you, Bilbo.
My dear boy.
Now, what have I forgotten?
Packed already?
No harm in being prepared.
I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
I do.
More than anything.
I did.
It's just...
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?
We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon.
Off home.
You are right, Sam.
We did what we set out to do.
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.
I am ready to go home.
His strength returns.
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.
We can ask no more of Frodo.
Gandalf, the enemy is moving.
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.
Our list of allies grows thin.
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
Saruman is coming for the Ring.
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!
Gandalf the Ring cannot stay here.
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.
They must decide now how to end it.
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.
It is in Men that we must place our hope.
Men?
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.
The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.
It is because of Men the Ring survives.
I was there, Gandalf.
I was there 3000 years ago when Isildur took the Ring.
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
Isildur, hurry!
Follow me.
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.
Cast it into the fire!
Destroy it!
No.
Isildur!
It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.
There's no strength left in the world of Men.
They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
There is one who could unite them.
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.
You are no Elf.
Men of the South are welcome here.
Who are you?
I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.
Then we are here on common purpose friend.
The shards of Narsil.
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.
It's still sharp.
But no more than a broken heirloom.
Why do you fear the past?
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.
You are not bound to his fate.
The same blood flows in my veins.
The same weakness.
Your time will come.
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.
Not over you... not over me.
You said you'd bind yourself to me forsaking the immortal life of your people.
And to that I hold.
I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the Ages of this world alone.
I choose a mortal life.
You cannot give me this.
It is mine to give to whom I will like my heart.
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.
You will unite, or you will fall.
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
So it is true.
In a dream I saw the eastern sky grow dark but in the West a pale light lingered.
A voice was crying:
"Your doom is near at hand.
Isildur's Bane is found."
Isildur's Bane.
Boromir!
Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond for the Black Speech of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West!
The Ring is altogether evil.
It is a gift.
A gift to the foes of Mordor.
Why not use this Ring?
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe.
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?
This is no mere Ranger.
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
You owe him your allegiance.
Aragorn.
This is Isildur's heir?
And heir to the throne of Gondor.
Gondor has no king.
Gondor needs no king.
Aragorn is right.
We cannot use it.
You have only one choice.
The Ring must be destroyed.
What are we waiting for?
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin by any craft that we here possess.
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.
Only there can it be unmade.
It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
One of you must do this.
One does not simply walk into Mordor.
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.
There is evil there that does not sleep.
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.
It is a barren wasteland riddled with fire, and ash and dust.
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The Ring must be destroyed.
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!
And if we fail, what then?
What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!
Never trust an Elf!
Do you not understand?
While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!
I will take it.
I will take it.
I will take the Ring to Mordor.
Though I do not know the way.
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins as long as it is yours to bear.
If by my life or death I can protect you I will.
You have my sword.
And you have my bow.
And my ax.
You carry the fates of us all, little one.
If this is indeed the will of the Council then Gondor will see it done.
Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
It is hardly possible to separate you even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.
We're coming too!
You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.
Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission.
Quest.
Thing.
Well, that rules you out, Pip.
Nine companions.
So be it.
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.
Great!
Where are we going?
She wanted to protect her child she thought in Rivendell you would be safe.
In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life.
That you'd never escape your fate.
The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings but only you have the power to wield it.
I do not want that power.
I have never wanted it.
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.
My old sword!
Sting.
Here, take it.
Take it.
It's so light.
Yes.
Made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.
And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.
Here's a pretty thing.
Mithril.
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.
Let me see you put it on.
Come on.
My old ring.
I should very much like to hold it again, one last time.
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.
I'm sorry for everything.
The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom.
On you who travel with him, no oath nor bond is laid to go further than you will.
Farewell.
Hold to your purpose.
May the blessings of Elves and Men and all Free Folk go with you.
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?
Left.
We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.
Two, one, five.
Good!
Very good.
Move your feet.
You look good, Pippin.
Thanks.
Faster!
If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.
Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.
No, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
Sorry!
Get him!
For the Shire!
Hold him.
Hold him down, Merry!
Gentlemen, that's enough.
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!
What is that?
Nothing.
It's just a wisp of cloud.
It's moving fast.
Against the wind.
Crebain from Dunland!
Hide!
Hurry!
Take cover!
Spies of Saruman.
The passage south is being watched.
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.
Frodo!
Boromir.
It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing.
Such a little thing.
Boromir!
Give the Ring to Frodo.
As you wish.
I care not.
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.
And if that fails, where then will you go?
If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous road?
There is a fell voice on the air.
It's Saruman!
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!
No!
We must get off the mountain!
Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city!
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.
Moria.
You fear to go into those mines.
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dum:
Shadow and flame.
Let the Ring-bearer decide.
We cannot stay here!
This will be the death of the Hobbits.
Frodo?
We will go through the mines.
So be it.
Frodo, come and help an old man.
How is your shoulder?
Better than it was.
And the Ring?
You feel its power growing, don't you?
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.
Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship.
And, I fear, from within.
Who then do I trust?
You must trust yourself.
Trust your own strengths.
What do you mean?
There are many powers in this world for good or for evil.
Some are greater than I am.
And against some I have not yet been tested.
The walls of Moria.
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, let's see.
Ithiidin.
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
It reads, "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.
Speak, friend, and enter." What do you suppose that means?
It's simple.
If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.
Nothing's happening.
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves Men and Orcs.
What are you going to do, then?
Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took!
And if that does not shatter them and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions I will try to find the opening words.
Mines are no place for a pony.
Even one so brave as Bill.
Bye-bye, Bill.
Go on, Bill.
Go on.
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.
Do not disturb the water.
Oh, it's useless.
It's a riddle.
"Speak 'friend' and enter."
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?
Mellon.
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.
And they call it a mine.
A mine!
This is no mine.
It's a tomb.
No...
No!
Goblins.
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.
Now, get out of here.
Get out!
Frodo!
Help!
Strider!
Help!
Get off him!
Aragorn!
Frodo!
Into the mines!
Legolas!
Into the cave!
Run!
We now have but one choice.
We must face the long dark of Moria.
Be on your guard.
There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.
The wealth of Moria was not in gold or jewels but mithril.
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.
Oh, that was a kingly gift.
Yes.
I never told him but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.
Pippin.
I have no memory of this place.
Are we lost?
No.
I think we are.
Gandalf's thinking.
Merry?
What?
I'm hungry.
There's something down there.
It's Gollum.
Gollum?
He's been following us for three days.
He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?
Escaped or was set loose.
Now the Ring has brought him here.
He will never be rid of his need for it.
He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.
Smeagol's life is a sad story.
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.
Before it drove him mad.
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
Pity?
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.
Can you give it to them, Frodo?
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over.
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.
There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.
In which case, you also were meant to have it.
And that is an encouraging thought.
It's that way.
He's remembered.
No.
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.
Let me risk a little more light.
Behold the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.
Gimli!
No!
Oh, no.
No.
"Here lies Balin..."
"...son of Fundin..."
"...
Lord of Moria."
He is dead, then.
It's as I feared.
We must move on.
We cannot linger.
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.
We have barred the gates but cannot hold them for long.
The ground shakes.
Drums drums in the deep.
We cannot get out.
A Shadow moves in the dark.
We cannot get out.
They are coming."
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity.
Frodo!
Orcs.
Get back!
Stay close to Gandalf!
They have a cave-troll.
Let them come!
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
Frodo!
Aragorn!
Aragorn!
Frodo!
Frodo!
Oh, no.
He's alive.
I'm all right.
I'm not hurt.
You should be dead.
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.
I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.
Mithril.
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.
To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!
This way!
What is this new devilry?
A Balrog.
A demon of the ancient world.
This foe is beyond any of you.
Run!
Quickly!
Gandalf.
Lead them on, Aragorn.
The bridge is near.
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.
Gandalf!
Merry!
Pippin!
Sam!
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.
Not the beard!
Steady.
Hold on!
Hang on!
Lean forward!
Steady.
Come on!
Now!
Over the bridge!
Fly!
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
Go back to the Shadow.
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
No!
Aragorn!
Legolas, get them up.
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.
Come, Boromir.
Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.
On your feet, Sam.
Frodo?
Frodo!
Stay close, young Hobbits!
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.
An Elf-witch of terrible power.
All who look upon her fall under her spell.
Frodo!
And are never seen again.
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.
You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer.
Mr. Frodo?
Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.
The Dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.
So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves!
Speak words we can all understand!
We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.
And you know what this Dwarf says to that?
That was not so courteous.
You bring great evil with you.
You can go no further.
Gandalf's death was not in vain.
Nor would he have you give up hope.
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.
Don't carry the weight of the dead.
You will follow me.
Caras Galadhon.
The heart of Elvendom on earth.
Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.
The enemy knows you have entered here.
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.
Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.
Tell me, where is Gandalf?
For I much desire to speak with him.
I can no longer see him from af ar.
Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.
He has fallen into Shadow.
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.
A Balrog of Morgoth.
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.
We do not yet know his full purpose.
Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dum fill your heart Gimli, son of Gloin.
For the world has grown full of peril and in all lands love is now mingled with grief.
What now becomes of this Fellowship?
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.
Stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all.
Yet hope remains while the Company is true.
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.
Tonight, you will sleep...
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire the one who has seen the Eye!
A lament for Gandalf.
What do they say about him?
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.
There should be a verse about them.
The finest rockets ever seen.
They burst in stars of blue and green.
Or after thunder, silver showers.
Came falling like a rain of flowers.
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.
Take some rest.
These borders are well-protected.
I will find no rest here.
I heard her voice inside my head.
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.
She said to me, "Even now there is hope left."
But I cannot see it.
It is long since we had any hope.
My father is a noble man.
But his rule is failing and our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?
The White Tower of Ecthelion.
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.
Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?
I have seen the White City long ago.
One day, our paths will lead us there.
And the tower guard shall take up the call:
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."
Will you look into the mirror?
What will I see?
Even the wisest cannot tell.
For the mirror shows many things.
Things that were things that are and some things that have not yet come to pass.
I know what it is you saw.
For it is also in my mind.
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.
He will try to take the Ring.
You know of whom I speak.
One by one, it will destroy them all.
If you ask it of me I will give you the One Ring.
You offer it to me freely.
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!
Treacherous as the sea!
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!
All shall love me and despair.
I pass the test.
I will diminish and go into the West and remain Galadriel.
I cannot do this alone.
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power is to be alone.
This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.
And I am its keeper.
This task was appointed to you.
And if you do not find a way no one will.
Then I know what I must do.
It's just I'm afraid to do it.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?
They were Elves once.
Taken by the Dark Powers tortured and mutilated.
A ruined and terrible form of life.
And now perfected.
My fighting Uruk-hai whom do you serve?
Saruman!
Hunt them down.
Do not stop until they are found.
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.
You will taste Man-flesh!
One of the halflings carries something of great value.
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.
Kill the others.
Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.
May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.
Lembas.
Elvish waybread.
One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.
How many did you eat?
Four.
Every league you travel south, the danger will increase.
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.
Strange creatures bearing the mark The White Hand have been seen on our borders.
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.
You are being tracked.
By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Fallis of Rauros.
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.
They have already seen service in war.
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.
You will find your courage.
And for you, Samwise Gamgee Elven rope made of hithlain.
Thank you, my lady.
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?
Nothing.
Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.
Actually...
There was one thing.
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.
Stupid to ask.
I have nothing greater to give than the gift you already bear.
For her love I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.
I would have har leave these shores and be with her people.
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.
That choice is yet before her.
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.
To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.
Farewell.
There is much you have yet to do.
We shall not meet again Elessar.
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.
I give you the light of Eärendil our most beloved star.
May it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out.
I have taken my worst wound at this parting having looked my last upon that which is fairest.
Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.
What was her gift?
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.
She gave me three.
Gollum.
He has tracked us since Moria.
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.
But he's too clever a waterman.
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts it will make the crossing even more dangerous.
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.
No, Sam.
You haven't eaten anything all day.
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.
Mr. Frodo...
I'm all right.
But you're not.
I'm here to help you.
I promised Gandalf that I would.
You can't help me, Sam.
Not this time.
Get some sleep.
Minas Tirith is the safer road.
You know that.
From there we can regroup.
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.
You were quick enough to trust the Elves.
Have you so little faith in your own people?
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.
But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men.
But you will not see that.
You are afraid!
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.
Scared of who you are, of what you are.
I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.
Frodo.
The Argonath.
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.
My kin.
We cross the lake at nightfall.
Hide the boats and continue on foot.
We approach Mordor from the North.
Oh, yes?
Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.
And after that, it gets even better.
Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.
That is our road.
I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
Recover my...
We should leave now.
No.
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.
Something draws near.
I can feel it.
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.
Where's Frodo?
None of us should wander alone.
You, least of all.
So much depends on you.
Frodo?
I know why you seek solitude.
You suffer.
I see it day by day.
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?
There are other ways, Frodo.
Other paths that we might take.
I know what you would say.
It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.
Warning?
Against what?
We're all afraid, Frodo.
But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have don't you see that is madness?
There is no other way.
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!
If you would but lend me the Ring.
No.
Why do you recoil?
I am no thief.
You are not yourself.
What chance do you think you have?
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.
And you will beg for death before the end!
You fool!
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.
It should be mine!
Give it to me!
Give it to me!
No!
Give it to me!
No.
I see your mind.
You will take the Ring to Sauron!
You will betray us!
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!
Frodo?
Frodo.
What have I done?
Please, Frodo.
Frodo, I'm sorry!
Frodo?
It has taken Boromir.
Where is the Ring?
Stay away!
Frodo!
I swore to protect you.
Can you protect me from yourself?
Would you destroy it?
Aragorn.
Aragorn.
Elessar.
I would have gone with you to the end.
Into the very fires of Mordor.
I know.
Look after the others.
Especially Sam.
He will not understand.
Go, Frodo!
Run.
Run!
Mr. Frodo!
Find the halfling!
Find the halfling!
Elendil!
Aragorn, go!
Frodo!
Hide here.
Quick!
Come on!
What's he doing?
He's leaving.
No!
Pippin!
Run, Frodo.
Go on!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Over here!
Over here!
This way!
It's working!
I know it's working!
Run!
The horn of Gondor.
Boromir.
Run!
No.
They took the little ones.
Hold still.
Frodo.
Where is Frodo?
I let Frodo go.
Then you did what I could not.
I tried to take the Ring from him.
The Ring is beyond our reach now.
Forgive me.
I did not see it.
I have failed you all.
No, Boromir.
You fought bravely.
You have kept your honor.
Leave it.
It is over.
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness and my city to ruin.
I do not know what strength is in my blood but I swear to you, I will not let the White City fall nor our people fail.
Our people.
Our people.
I would have followed you, my brother.
My captain.
My king.
Be at peace son of Gondor.
They will look for his coming from the White Tower.
But he will not return.
Frodo!
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide.
All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.
Frodo, no!
Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
No, Sam.
Go back, Sam!
I'm going to Mordor alone.
Of course you are.
And I'm coming with you!
You can't swim!
Sam!
Sam!
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.
I don't mean to.
Sam.
Come on.
Hurry!
Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.
You mean not to follow them.
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.
Not if we hold true to each other.
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.
We travel light.
Let us hunt some Orc.
Yes!
Mordor.
I hope the others find a safer road.
Strider will look after them.
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.
We may.
Sam I'm glad you are with me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested-?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- ... and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- ... was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- ... send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Smeagol.
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon-?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions-
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- ... 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave. "
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
eothain!
eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred.
eOWYN:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THeODEN:
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, eomer, son of eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
Get back, scum!
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Hmm.
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Oh.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
SMeAGOL:
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
SMeAGOL:
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
[SMeAGOL WHIMPERS]
SMeAGOL:
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
SMeAGOL:
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Oh.
[IN ENGLISH] The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
SMeAGOL:
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
SMeAGOL:
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
eOWYN:
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
[THeODEN WHIMPERS]
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head-on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
THeODEN:
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
HÁMA:
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
SMeAGOL:
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
SMeAGOL:
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
SMeAGOL:
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
[SMeAGOL SHRIEKING]
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
Who are they?
SMeAGOL:
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Aye!
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
GIMLl:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen... eOWYN:
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
[IN ENGLISH] Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
eOWYN:
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLl:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLl:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
eOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLl:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
At last!
Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
Mama!
eothain!
Freda!
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLl:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
THeODEN:
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
[IN ENGLISH] I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
[WHISPERING] We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Smeagol.
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
SMeAGOL:
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
SMeAGOL:
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
SMeAGOL:
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
SMeAGOL:
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
[IN ENGLISH] You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
THeODEN:
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Keep moving.
Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
Aragorn.
[IN ENGLISH] Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
[INDISTINCT GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
ARAGORN [IN ELVISH]:
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
[URUK-HAI BATTLE CRIES]
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
Huh?
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two and 23!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
GIMLl:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
THeODEN:
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Oh, come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
THeODEN:
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
Fall back!
THeODEN:
Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
THeODEN:
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
[GROANING AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
THeODEN:
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
SMeAGOL:
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
GANDALF:
You cannot pass!
FRODO:
Gandalf!
GANDALF:
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!

Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
[RUMBLES]
[GASPING]
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
Those rain clouds might.
SAM:
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
SAM:
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
FRODO:
Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
[SNORING]
[GROWLING]
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

[FRODO GROANS]

This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
[CHOKING]
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
[SCREAMING]
[SCREAMING ECHOES]
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
[GASPING]
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
[RUMBLING]
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
[GIMLI GROANS]
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
ARAGORN:
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
ARAGORN:
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
LEGOLAS:
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
[HAMMERING]
SARUMAN:
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
[YELLING AND SQUEALING]
SARUMAN:
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
SARUMAN:
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
[YELLING]
SARUMAN:
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
[SCREAMING]
Quickly!
Go, child.
SARUMAN:
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
ÉOWYN:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THÉODEN:
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
[GROANS]
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
[YELLS]
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
ORC 1:
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[TREES GROANING]
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
[WHIMPERING]
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
LEADER:
Get back, scum!
ORC 2:
Carve them up!
ORC 3:
Just a mouthful.
LEADER:
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
[HORSES NEIGHING]
[HOOVES BEATING]
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
[WHISTLES]
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[YELLS]
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
[TREES GROANING]
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.

They ran over here.
They were followed.
MERRY:
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
PIPPIN:
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.

I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.

Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Hmm.
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
[MERRY AND PIPPIN GROANING]
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
GOLLUM:
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
SAM:
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
SAM:
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
GOLLUM:
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Oh.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!

- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
FRODO:
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
[THUNDER ROLLING]
GOLLUM:
So bright.
So beautiful.

What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
Sméagol.

Black Riders!
SMÉAGOL:
Hide!

Come on, Frodo.

SMÉAGOL:
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
[TREES GROANING] ...and anger.

The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN:

Lower your ax.
Oh.

[IN ENGLISH] The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
[YELLING]
WHITE WIZARD:
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
[GASPS]
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
[WHISTLING]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GANDALF:
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD:
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
SMÉAGOL:
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
SMÉAGOL:
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
[HORNS BLOWING]
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
[RUMBLING]
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
GANDALF:
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
ÉOWYN:
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
[RIPPING]
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
[LAUGHING]
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
[THÉODEN WHIMPERS]
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[GROANING]
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
[YELLING]

MAN:
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
GANDALF:
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
[SPEAKING IN ROHIRRIM]
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head-on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
THÉODEN:
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
[BURPS]
Then what is the king's decision?
HÁMA:
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI:
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
WORMTONGUE:
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
[GROWLING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM:
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
SMÉAGOL:
No.
Not master.
GOLLUM:
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
SMÉAGOL:
Master's my friend.
GOLLUM:
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
[GROWLS]
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
SMÉAGOL:
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
[CHUCKLING]
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
[SMÉAGOL SHRIEKING]
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
SAM:
Who are they?
SMÉAGOL:
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
[OLIPHAUNT GROANS]
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
Sméagol?
[SCREAMING]
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Aye!
[GROANING]
Bind their hands.
GIMLI:
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
[GIMLI YELLS]
GIMLl:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
ARWEN:
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
[IN ELVISH]
Arwen...
ÉOWYN:
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND:
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
ÉOWYN:
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
[YELLING AND ROARING]
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLl:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
[BARKING]
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLl:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
ÉOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
[YELLING]
GIMLl:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
[SNIFFS]
[GRUNTING]
[GROANS]
[YELLS]
[GROANS]
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
[LAUGHING]
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
[LAUGHING AND CHOKING]
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
WOMAN 1:
At last!
WOMAN 2:
Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 3:
There it is, Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 4:
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
FREDA:
Mama!
MORWEN:
Éothain!
Freda!
GAMLING:
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLl:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING:
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
THÉODEN:
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
WORMTONGUE:
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
SARUMAN:
Tens of thousands.
WORMTONGUE:
But, my lord, there is no such force.
[HORNS SOUNDING]
[ARMY CHEERING]
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
TREEBEARD:
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
ARWEN:
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
ELROND:
Arwen.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
[IN ELVISH]
[GALADRIEL SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
GALADRIEL:
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
[ROARING]
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
FARAMIR:
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
MAN:
Captain Faramir!
[WHISPERING] We found the third one.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
[YELLS]
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
[FOOTSTEP]
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
[MUFFLED CRIES]
No!
No!
[GRUNTING AND PANTING]
Where are you leading them?
[CRYING]
FARAMIR:
Answer me.
GOLLUM:
Sméagol.
[CRYING]
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
SMÉAGOL:
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
GOLLUM:
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
SMÉAGOL:
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
GOLLUM:
Master betrayed us.
SMÉAGOL:
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
GOLLUM:
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
SMÉAGOL:
No.
No.
What did they steal?
GOLLUM:
My precious!
[YELLS]
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
[VOICE OF THE RING WHISPERING]
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
SAM:
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
[DISTANT MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
WOMAN:
He's alive!
GIMLI:
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] You look terrible.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
[DOORS OPENING]
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
ARAGORN:
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN:
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
MAN 1:
We need more time to lay provisions...
THÉODEN:
There is no time.
War is upon us.
MAN 2:
Secure the gate.
[CAWING]
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
[RUMBLING]
TREEBEARD:
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
GUARD 1:
Move back!
Move to the caves!
GUARD 1:
Keep moving.
GUARD 2:
Quickly now.
[BABY CRYING]
[MUTED SPEECH]
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
[IN ELVISH]
Aragorn.
[IN ENGLISH] Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
GUARD:
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
[IN ELVISH]
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
[HORN BLOWING]
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
GUARD:
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[INDISTINCT GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
[THUNDER ROLLS]
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[BABY CRYING]
ARAGORN [IN ELVISH]:
[ROARS]
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
[URUK-HAI BATTLE CRIES]
[IN ELVISH]
[GROANS]
So it begins.
[IN ELVISH]
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
Send them to me!
Come on!
[IN ELVISH]
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
Huh?
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
[ENTS GROANING]
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two and 23!
Causeway!
[ARAGORN SHOUTS IN ELVISH]
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
[IN ELVISH]
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
[ENTS GRUMBLING]
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING:
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
[IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
GIMLl:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
[SHOUTING IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
THÉODEN:
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Oh, come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
[STAMMERS]
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
MAN 1:
Make way!
MAN 2:
Follow me to the barricade.
MAN 1:
Watch our backs!
MAN 3:
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
MAN 4:
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
GAMLING:
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
Retreat!
ARAGORN:
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
THÉODEN:
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
MAN:
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
FRODO:
Faramir!
You must let me go!
TREEBEARD:
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
[GASPS]
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
[ROARING]
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
[GROANING AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Yes.
TREEBEARD:
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
[MUTED SPEECH]
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
ITHILIEN RANGER:
Watch out!
[RUMBLING]
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
THÉODEN:
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
WOMAN 1:
They're breaking in!
WOMAN 2:
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
GANDALF:
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
[HORN BLOWS]
Forth Eorlingas!
[BATTLE CRIES]
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
[GRUNTS]
[ENTS ROARING]
TREEBEARD:
A hit.
A fine hit.
[TREEBEARD GRUNTS]
TREEBEARD:
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
[RUMBLING]
[ROARING]
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
[PANTING]
[SWORD CLANGS]
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
SAM:
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
[RUMBLING]
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
FRODO:
Sméagol?
SAM:
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.
SMÉAGOL:
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
SAM:
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
FRODO:
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
Get back, scum!
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of GIóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Hmm.
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Oh.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Oh.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head-on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
Who are they?
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Aye!
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
GIMLl:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLl:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLl:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLl:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
At last!
Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
Mama!
Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLl:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Keep moving.
Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
Aragorn.
Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
ARAGORN
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
Huh?
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two and 23!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
GIMLl:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Oh, come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
NazgûI!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave. "
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
I'm the servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the shadow!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
Nooooooooo!
Gandalf!
What is it Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle Earth we don't want to see any closer.
It's the one place we are trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it Mr. Frodo.
We're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam.
...but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Well, let me see.
Oh yes, lovely
Lembas bread!
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold to foreign food, but this elvish stuff is not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
Those rainclouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
That's because we've been here before!
We are going in circles!
Ah!
What's that 'orrid stink?
I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
Can you smell it?
Yes I can smell it.
We are not alone.
Those thieves!
Those filthy little thieves!
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us
My precious.
We hate them!
We hate them!
We want it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before!
haven't you, Gollum!
Release him or I'll cut your throat!
It burns!
It burns us!
Take it off!
-Quiet you!
It's hopeless!
Every Orc in Mordor will hear this racket!
-Let's tie him up and leave him!
-No!
That will kill us, kill us!
It's nothing more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
Now that I've seen him, I do pity him.
We be very nice to hobbits, you be nice to us.
We swear to do what you wants.
We swear!
There is no promise you make that I can trust.
We swear to serve the master of the precious.
We swear on on the precious.
Gollum, Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the preciouss.
I don't believe you!
Get down!
-Get down!
-Sam!
He was trying to trick us!
We let him go he'll throttle us into our sleep!
-Do you know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail!
Let's go!
Their pace quickens.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on Gimli!
Three day's and night's pursuit.
No food... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare Rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us, come!
Come Gimli!
We are gaining on them.
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous we are over short distances.
Rohan, home of the horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets it's will against us.
Legolas!
What does your elf eyes see?
The Orcs turn Northeast.
They are taking the hobbits to Isengard!
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard ...and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, Lord Sauron, ...we shall rule this Middle-Earth.
The old world will burn in the fires of industry.
Forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machinery of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the Orcs.
We now have only to remove those who oppose us.
The horsemen have taken your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of Rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in the Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
But Papa says Eothain must not ride.
He's too big for him!
Listen to me!
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm
-Do you understand me?
-Yes mum!
I don't wanna go!
I don't wanna go, mama!
Freda, listen to me.
I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child!
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred!
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie!
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked, unchallenged, killing at will.
Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is weary of your malcontent.
...your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long has it been since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing, that's the key!
Breathe!
Ho!
They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We ain't goin' no further till we've had a breather.
Get the fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think, we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest?
On the borders of Buckland?
Folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
What about them?
They're flesh!
They are not for eating!
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
Ooh!
They look tasty!
Get back!
Just a mouthful?
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu boys!
Pippin!
Let's go!
Go on, call for help.
Squeal!
No one's gonna save you now!
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan!
What news from the Mark?
What business does an elf, a man, and a dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell!
I'm Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas from the Woodland realm
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your King.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there they say as an old man.
Hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a band of Uruk-Hai westward across the plains.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Do you see two Hobbits with them?
They will be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
They're dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters.
Farewel.
Look for your friends, but do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their little belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here and the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here and were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into...
Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drew them there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm gonna rip off both your little heads!
Come here!
Trees!
Climb a tree!
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot-hole in your belly.
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs!
It's talking Merry.The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
Treeherder!
Shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it Merry.
Don't encourage it.
Treebeard some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody is on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore..
We're not Orcs.
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire they come with axes.
Biting, breaking, hacking, burning.
Destroyers and usurpers Curse them!
No!
You don't understand.
We are Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shirefolk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't
The White Wizard will know.
White Wizard?
Saruman!
See, see!
We have led you out!
Hurry, hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice hobbit.
It's a bog!
He's led us into a swamp!
Swamp, yes, yes!
Come master.
We will take you to safe paths, through the mist.
Come Hobbits, come.
We move quickly!
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it
They go round for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Swift and quick like shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water!
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcs.
A great battle long ago.
The Dead Marshes.
Yes, yes!
That is the name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights!
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you alright?
So bright, so beautiful.
Ah precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master need to keep up his strength.
Who are you?
Musn't ask us it's name not his business.
Gollum, Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
Call me heart and hand and bone.
And call every traveller far from home.
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead.
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once were you?
Sméagol?
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My...
My name
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on Frodo, Come on!
They will see us!
They will see us
- I thought they were dead!
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's alright.
I'm here.
Hurry, hobbits!
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood!
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memories and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your axe.
Aragorn, something is out there!
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will out a spell on us!
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be!
You fell!
Through fire.... ...and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought him, the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me.... ...and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf!
Gandalf?
Oh yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf!
I am Gandalf the White now.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of the journey is over, another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax
He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
My home.
I sleep in the forest here.
The roots of the mountains.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have gone wild and dangerous.
Anger is in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us that are left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw this.
Master says show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does what master says so.
I did.
We cannot get past them.
Look!
The gate, it's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam!
No!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there.
Now!
No!
No!
No master!
They catch you!
They catch you.
Don't take it to Him.
He wants the precious.
Always he's looking for it!
And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him.
But we musn't let him have it.
No!
There is another way.
More secret and dark way.
Why haven't you spoke of this before?
Because master did not ask!
He is up to something.
Are you saying is another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There is a path and some stairs .
And then a tunnel.
He has led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no!
He's been true to his word.
No!
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always help.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld
Here lives the King of Rohan ...whose mind is overthrown... and Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son is dead
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
He must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand his passing is hard to accept.
especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, you snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
The bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you
So fair.
So cold.
like a morning pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
This place is as cheerful as a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden-king so armed, Gandalf Grayhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
Oh.
No, you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
A herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden-King.
He is not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf, Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question my lord.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent!
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not pass trough dead to bandy a few words with a witless worm.
Your staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff!
Théoden Son of Thengel too long have you sat in the shadows.
I would stay still, if I were you!
Talk to me!
I will release you from the spell.
You have no powers here Gandalf the Grey
I shall draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine!
Be gone!
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn!
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever...
served you my lord.
Your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your side!
No my Lord!
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden, King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
At last, that these evil days shall be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirits will find his way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the wildmen are moving through westfold.
Burning as they go... every rick and cotton tree.
Where's momma?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from the women and children.
You must fight!
You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be three hundred leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what is that you want of me.
But I would not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep!
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He is only doing what he thinks is best for his people
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that of ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he is leading them to safety.
But what he'll get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong hold but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end there, Aragorn
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That is what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of men have walked this earth and now, I have no time.
Good luck.
My search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming.
At first light of the fifth day at dawn, look to the East.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You are a daughter of kings.
A shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that will be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It is vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
It will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your warg riders.
Hey Stinker!
Don't go getting too far ahead!
Why do you do that?
- What?
- Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him.
What is still doing to him.
I want to help him Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taking a hold of you Mr Frodo.
You have to fight it.
I know what I have to do Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me
It's my task!
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We need it.
Must have the Precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little hobbitses.
Wicked, tricky, filth!
No!
No!
Master.
Yes.
Precious first.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
Not listening.
You´re a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer!
Go away!
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum!
Gollum!
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No!
Leave now and never come back!
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away!
And away he goes, precious.
Gone, gone, gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look!
Look!
See what Sméagol finds!
They are young!
They are tender and nice.
Yes they are!
Eat them.
Eat them!
Make him sick you will behaving like that
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
Whats he doing!
Stupid fat hobbit!
You ruin it!
Whats to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need it a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Po-ta-toes!
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh yes we could.
Spoiling nice fish!
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips!
You're hopeless.
Mr Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
It will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make His war
The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
We've got to keep moving.
Come on Sam.
Mr. Frodo!
Look!
It's an Oliphant!
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here for too long.
Come on Sam!
Ah!
Bind their hands.
It's true you don't see many dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... ..they are often mistaken for dwarf men.
It's the beards.
And this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no dwarf women.
And the dwarves just, spring out of holes in the ground!
Which is of course ridiculous.
It's alright!
It's alright!
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen.
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel?
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the West.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands there to the ever green.
But never more than a memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
You have a chance for another life... away from war...grief...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I'm mortal.
You're an elfkind.
It was a dream Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Wargs!
We are under attack!
All riders to the head of the column!
Come on, get me up here.
I'm a rider!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep and make haste.
- I can fight!
- No!
You must do this.
For me.
Follow me!
- Forward, forward, march forward.
- Make for the lower ground.
Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my axe!
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature!
Aragorn!
Aragorn!
- Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing
- He's dead.
He took a little thumble off the cliff.
You lie!
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolfs of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
Finally!
Helmsdeep!
There it is, Helmsdeep!
We're saved, my lady!
Thank you!
Mama!
Make way for the king!
So few, so few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives
Mylady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate and set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight my lord?
- The women and children?
- Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has but one weakness.
It's outer wall is solid Rock for for except for a small culvert in space which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device can break down a wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
It's victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Man.
Look!
The smoke to the south!
There is always smoke rising up from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now, he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army!
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now before it is too late.
I've made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hoped for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality...
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time.... ...Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you.
No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death.
An image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory, undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...
As night falling winter has come without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to you grief, under the fading trees until all the world has changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ringbearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand.
The quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand to take the Ring for his own and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving it's goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even until the ending of the world.
The time of the elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-Earth to it's fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshalling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.
How many?
Some thousands.
More come every day.
Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled five hundred men out of Osgiliath.
But if the city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies!
Now wait just a minute!
Well if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak!
We are hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favoured look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria.
Two were my kin.
A dwarf there was also.
And an elf.
And two men Aragorn, son of Arathorn and Boromir of Gondor.
You were friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It would grieve you then to learn that he is dead?
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I had hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found it...
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall they shoot?
Rock and pool is nice and cool.
So juicy sweet.
I only wish to catch a fish!
So juicy sweet!
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol!
Master is here!
Come, Sméagol!
Trust master.
Come!
We must... go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me, come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol don't struggle!
Sméagol listen to me!
Master!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me!
Sméagol?
Why do you cry, Sméagol?
Cruel men hurt us.
Master tricked us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricky.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend... our friend.
Master betrayed us!
No, not it's business.
Leave us alone.
Filthy little hobbits!
They stole it from us!
No... no.
What did they steal?
My Precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me.
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on He'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So... this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the wild I have you.
Two haflings and a host of men at my call.
And the Ring of power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone!
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going.
Into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire.
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he?
Get out of my way!
I'm gonna kill him!
You are the the luckiest, the cunningest and most reckless man I ever knew!
Bless you, laddie!
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten-thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
to destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come.
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the deeping wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs!
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on Rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages!
They come to destroy its people down to the last child!
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance!
Send out riders, my lord
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
Where was Gon...?
No, my lord Aragorn we are alone.
- Get the women and children into the caves.
- We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord.
- There is no time.
War is upon us!
Secure the gate.
The ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time.
But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Ent moot.
What's that?
It is a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Muitos vieram.
Beech, Oak, Chestnut, Ash.
Good, good, good many have come.
Now we must decide if the ents will go to war.
Move to the cage!
Quickly now!
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be.
Three hundred against ten thousand.
They have a better chance defending themselves here than in Edoras.
They cannot win this fight!
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
You're men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the west behind the hills into shadow.
How did it come to this?
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Háleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword Háleth, son of Háma.
There is always hope.
We have trusted you this far and you have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
If we had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn!
Send for the king.
Open the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honour that allegiance.
You are most welcome!
We are proud to fight alongside men, once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well lad, the luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy!
For you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
Hold!
So it begins.
Preparem-se a disparar!
Their armour is weak at the neck and under the arms.
Fire!
Anybody hit anything?
Give them a volley.
Fire!
Come on!
Send them to them!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
- Legolas, two already!
- I'm on seventeen!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the ent moot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help!
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War, yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in old entish.
And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
Twenty.
Twenty one.
Twenty two.
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman.
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gates!
Hold them!
Stand fast!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Prepare to charge!
The ents cannot hold back this war.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
This is not our war.
But your part of this world!
Aren't you?
You must help.
Please!
You must do something.
You are young and brave, master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckburough and Buckland will burn.
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Pull back to the keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
To the gate!
Draw your swords!
We can't hold much longer.
Hold them!
How long do you need?
As long as you can give me!
Gimli!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them!
It's a long way,
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance.
Toss me!
Don't tell the elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back!
Pull them back!
Pull back!
They've broken through!
The castle is free!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside!
Get them inside!
Come, to the keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south!
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly
If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad, we'll be caught!
No we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns.
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and it tickles me awfully.
They're always trying to get somebody.
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in elvish entish or the tongues of men for this treachery!
My business is with Isengard tonight.
With a rock and stone.
Yes!
Come my friends!
The ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our dooml
The last march of the ents.
Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we'll be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be alright.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
You wanna know what happened to Boromir?
You wanna know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo!
After swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it They have died defending it!
They're breaking in!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far The Uruk-hai are too many.
Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory?
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the East.
Yes.
Yes!
The Horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and the red dawn!
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden-king stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin, hold on!
Hold on, little hobbits!
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened.
Victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing.... ...this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you.
That meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going.
Because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country.
The laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, 'let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.'
And they'll say, 'yes, that's one of my favorite stories.
Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, dad.'
'Yes, my boy... the most famousest of hobbits.
And that's saying alot.'
'You left out one of the chief characters.
Samwise the Brave.
I want to hear more about Sam
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.'
Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
'Samwise the Brave.'
Sméagol?
We're not gonna wait for you.
Come on!
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise!
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us!
Wicked, tricky, filth!
We ought to ring his filthy little neck!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
Then we take the Precious and we be the master!
But the fat hobbit.He knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out!
Put out his eyses.
And make him crawl.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Kill them both.
Yes!
No.
No!
It's too risky, it's too risky!
Where's he gone?
- Gollum, where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious she could!
And then we take it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Hush!
Come on, hobbits.
Long ways to go yet!
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
ÉOWYN:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THÉODEN:
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
Get back, scum!
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Hmm.
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Oh.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Oh.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
ÉOWYN:
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head-on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
THÉODEN:
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
HÁMA:
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
Who are they?
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Aye!
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
GIMLl:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
ÉOWYN:
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
ÉOWYN:
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLl:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLl:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
ÉOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLl:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
At last!
Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
Mama!
Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLl:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
THÉODEN:
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
THÉODEN:
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Keep moving.
Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
Aragorn.
Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
Huh?
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two and 23!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
GIMLl:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
THÉODEN:
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Oh, come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
THÉODEN:
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
THÉODEN:
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it? They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry! What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry! I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
Get back, scum!
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of GIoin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Hmm.
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Oh.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Oh.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head-on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
Who are they?
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Aye!
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
GIMLl:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen... Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLl:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLl:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLl:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
At last!
Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
Mama!
Eothain!
Freda!
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLl:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Smeagol.
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king? You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Keep moving.
Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
ARAGORN
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box? So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on! Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
Huh?
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two and 23!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman? Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli! The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there! Haldir! GIMLl:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Oh, come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back! They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave. "
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
The Lord of the Rings_The Two Towers (2002) 23.976 by Hiren
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war... grief... despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quicky, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
South Farthing
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
The Lord of the Rings_The Two Towers (2002) 23.976 by Hiren Thanks
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!
I'm the servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the shadow!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
Nooooooooo!
Gandalf!
What is it Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle Earth we don't want to see any closer.
It's the one place we are trying to get to.
It's just where we cant get.
Let's face it Mr. Frodo.
We're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam.
...but they did.
Mr.Frodo?
It's the Ring isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Well, let me see.
Oh yes, lovely
Lembas bread!
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold to foreign food, but this elvish stuff is not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
Those rainclouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
That's because we've been here before!
We are going in circles!
Ah!
What's that 'orrid stink?
I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
Can you smell it?
Yes I can smell it.
We are not alone.
Those thieves!
Those filthy little thieves!
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us
My precious.
We hate them!
We hate them!
We want it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before!
haven't you, Gollum!
Release him or I'll cut your throat!
It burns!
It burns us!
Take it off!
-Quiet you!
It's hopeless!
Every Orc in Mordor will hear this racket!
-Let's tie him up and leave him!
-No!
That will kill us, kill us!
It's nothing more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
Now that I've seen him, I do pity him.
We be very nice to hobbits, you be nice to us.
We swear to do what you wants.
We swear!
There is no promise you make that I can trust.
We swear to serve the master of the precious.
We swear on on the precious.
Gollum, Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the preciouss.
I don't believe you!
Get down!
-Get down!
-Sam!
He was trying to trick us!
We let him go he'll throttle us into our sleep!
-Do you know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail!
Let's go!
Their pace quickens.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on Gimli!
Three day's and night's pursuit.
No food... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare Rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us, come!
Come Gimli!
We are gaining on them.
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous we are over short distances.
Rohan, home of the horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets it's will against us.
Legolas!
What does your elf eyes see?
The Orcs turn Northeast.
They are taking the hobbits to Isengard!
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard ...and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, Lord Sauron, ...we shall rule this Middle-Earth.
The old world will burn in the fires of industry.
Forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machinery of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the Orcs.
We now have only to remove those who oppose us.
The horsemen have taken your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of Rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in the Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
But Papa says Eothain must not ride.
He's too big for him!
Listen to me!
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm
-Do you understand me?
-Yes mum!
I don't wanna go!
I don't wanna go, mama!
Freda, listen to me.
I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child!
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred!
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie!
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grimá.
Grimá.
Grimá.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked, unchallenged, killing at will.
Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is weary of your malcontent.
...your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long has it been since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grimá?
When all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Èomer son of Èomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing, that's the key!
Breathe!
Ho!
They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We ain't goin' no further till we've had a breather.
Get the fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think, we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest?
On the borders of Buckland?
Folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
What about them?
They're flesh!
They are not for eating!
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
Ooh!
They look tasty!
Get back!
Just a mouthful?
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu boys!
Pippin!
Let's go!
Go on, call for help.
Squeal!
No one's gonna save you now!
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan!
What news from the Mark?
What business does an elf, a man, and a dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell!
I'm Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas from the Woodland realm
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, its King.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this land.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there they say as an old man.
Hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
We are not spies.
We track a band of Uruk-Hai westward across the plains.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Do you see two Hobbits with them?
They will be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
They are dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters.
Farewel.
Look for your friends, but do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their little belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here and the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here and were followed.
The belt!
Run!
OTracks lead away from the battle into...
Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drew them there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm gonna rip off both your little heads!
Come here!
Trees!
Climb a tree!
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot-hole in your belly.
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs!
It's talking Merry.The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
Treeherder!
Shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it Merry.
Don't encourage it.
Treebeard some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody is on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore..
We are not Orcs.
We are Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire they come with axes.
Biting, breaking, hacking, burning.
Destroyers and usurpers
Curse them!
No!
You don't understand.
We are Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shirefolk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't/
The White Wizard will know.
White Wizard?
Saruman!
See, see!
We have led you out!
Hurry, hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice hobbit.
It's a bog!
He's led us into a swamp!
Swamp, yes, yes!
Come master.
We will take you to safe paths, through the mist.
Come Hobbits, come.
We move quickly!
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it
They go round for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Swift and quickly.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water!
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and men and Orcs.
A great battle long ago.
The Dead Marshes.
Yes, yes!
That is the name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights!
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you alright?
So bright, so beautiful.
Ah precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master need to keep up his strength.
Who are you?
Musn't ask us it's name not his business.
Gollum, Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
Cold be heart and Rock and bone.
And call every traveller far from home.
He said your life was was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead.
You were not so different from a Hobbit once were you...
Sméagol?
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My...
My name
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
C'mon Frodo, C'mon!
They will see us!
They will see us
- I thought they were dead!
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for the precious
Mr. Frodo!
It's alright.
I'm here.
Hurry, hobbits!
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood!
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memories and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your axe.
Aragorn, something is out there!
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will out a spell on us!
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be!
You fell!
Through fire.... ...and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought him, the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me.... ...and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and each day was as long as a life age of the earth.But it was not the end
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf!
Gandalf?
Oh yes.
That's what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf!
I am Gandalf the White now.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of the journey is over, another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax
He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
My home.
I sleep in the forest here.
The roots of the mountains.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have gone wild and dangerous.
Anger is in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us that are left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw this.
Master says show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does what master says so.
I did.
We cannot get past them.
Look!
The gate, it's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam!
No!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there.
Now!
No!
No!
No master!
They catch you!
They catch you.
Don't take it to Him.
He wants the precious.
Always he's looking for it!
And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him.
But we musn't let him have it.
No!
There is another way.
More secret, and dark way.
Why haven't you spoke of this before?
Because master did not ask!
He is up to something.
Are you saying that there is another way to Mordor?
Yes.
There is a path and some stairs .
And then a tunnel.
He has led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no!
He's been true to his word.
No!
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always help.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld
Here lives the King of Rohan ...whose mind is overthrown... and Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son is dead
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
He must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand his passing is hard to accept.
especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, you snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
The bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you
So fair.
So cold.
like a morning pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
This place is as cheerful as a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden-king so armed, Gandalf Grayhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
Oh.
No, you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
My Lord.
Gandalf the Grey is coming.
A herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden-King.
He is not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf, Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question my lord.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Silence!
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not come here to bandy words with a witless worm.
Your staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff!
Théoden Son of Thengel too long have you sat in shadows.
I would stay still if I were you!
I will release you from the spell.
You have no powers here Gandalf the Grey
I shall draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine!
Be gone!
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn!
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark my dreams have been of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you my lord.
Your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your side!
No my Lord!
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden, King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
At last, that these evil days shall be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirits will find his way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the wildmen are moving through westfold.
Burning as they go, every rick and cot.
Where's momma?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from the women and children.
You must fight!
You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak.
Èomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be three hundred leagues from here by now.
Èomer cannot help us.
I know what is that you want of me.
But I would not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep!
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He is only doing what he thinks is best for his people
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that of ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he is leading them to safety.
But what he'll get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong hold but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end there, Aragorn
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That is what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of men have walked this earth and now, I have no time.
Good luck.
My search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming.
At first light of the fifth day at dawn, look to the East.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You are a daughter of kings.
A shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that will be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It is vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
It will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your warg riders.
Hey Stinker!
Don't go getting too far ahead!
Why do you do that?
- What?
- Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
'Cause that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him.
What is still doing to him.
I want to help him Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he could come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taking a hold of you Mr Frodo.
You have to fight it.
I know what I have to do Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me
It's my task!
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We want it.
We need it.
Must have the Precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little hobbitses.
Wicked, tricky, filth!
No!
No!
Master.
Yes.
Precious first.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
Not listening.
You´re a liar, and a thief.
No.
Murderer!
Go away!
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum!
Gollum!
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No!
Leave now and never come back!
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away!
And away he goes, precious.
Gone, gone, gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look!
Look!
See what Sméagol finds!
They are young!
They are tender and nice.
Yes they are!
Eat them.
Eat them!
Make him sick you will behaving like that
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
Whats he doing!
Stupid fat hobbit!
You ruin it!
Whats to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need it a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Po-ta-toes!
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh yes we could.
Spoiling nice fish!
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips!
You're hopeless.
Mr Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
It will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make His war
The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
We've got to keep moving.
Come on Sam.
Mr. Frodo!
Look!
It's an Oliphant!
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here for too long.
Come on Sam!
Ah!
Bind their hands.
It's true you don't see many dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... ..they are often mistaken for dwarf men.
It's the beards.
And this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no dwarf women.
And the dwarves just, spring out of holes in the ground!
Which is of course ridiculous.
It's alright!
It's alright!
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am alseep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once this day would come.
This is not the end.
It is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen.
If you trust nothing else trust this trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel?
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the West.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands there to be ever green.
But never more than a memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
You have a chance for another life away from war, grief ...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I'm mortal.
You are elfkind.
It was a dream Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Wargs!
We are under attack!
All riders to the head of the column!
Come on, get me up here.
I'm a rider!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep and make haste.
- I can fight!
- No!
You must do this.
For me.
Follow me!
Forward.
I mean.
Can't forward
Stay together!
Bring your pussy face to my ass
That was mine!
Aragon!
Aragon!
Tell me what happen and I will ease your passing
Ease!
Dead
Take a little tumble from the cliff
You lie
Get the wound on the horses
The Wolf and the others will return
Leave the dead
Come
We saved!
Make way to the king!
So few?
.
So few have return
Our people are save
We have pay for it with lifes
My Lady
Lord Aragon?
Where is he?
Fell
Draw our forces behind the wall
By the gate
And set a watch for surround
One of those who cannot fight, My Lord
The women and children
Get them into the caves
Sarumon army thinks they can reach us here?
Humsdeed passed one weakness on a wall.
Solid Rock for a small comrade base
Which is little hole in the drain
How?
.
How can fire disturbed?
What kind of device can bring down the wall?
If the wall is breach, Humsdeed will fall
Even if it breached.
It would take a to storm the keep
-Ten of thousand
-But my Lord there is no such fools
The new power is arising
The victory is at hand!
This night, the land will be staying with the blood of the cold hearted
But to Humsdeed
Live and alive
To war!
There will be no dawn
For man
Look, the smoke to the shelf
It's only smoke arising from Isengard these day
Isengard?
That is the time where Sarumon will be walking in my woods
But now he has a mind of lethal
And the vision
He no longer cares for growing things
What is it?
It's Sarumon army
War started
Make a grace to the Valhalla to protect you
I have make my choice
He is not coming back
Why you linger here while there is no hope
There is still hope
If Aragon is survive in this war
You still be departed
If Sarumon is defeated and Aragon make king
All you hope for comes true
You still have to taste the bitterness of the mortality
By the sword nor the slow of the time
Aragon will died
And there will be no comfort for you
No comfort ease the pain of his passing
He will come to dead
And the image of the splender of the king of man
In glory undim before the breaking of the world
That you might, my daughter
You will linger on the darkness and a doubt
It's a night for a winter fall come without a star
Here you will well bound to your grieve
Under a faithing trees
Until all the world has change for your long year of live man
Arman
There is nothing for you here
Only death
The power of the enemy is growing
Sarumon will be using his puppet Sarumon to destroy the people of Rohan
Isengard has been unleashed
The eye of Sarumon now turns to Gondor
The last three kingdom of man
He's war in this country will come shifty
He senses the ring
It's close
The strength of the ring barrel is failling
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand
The quest will claim his life
You know this
You have fore seeing it
This is the risk we all took
In the gathering dark
The will of the ring go strong
It's work hard now to find his way back to the hands of man
Man, who are so easily seduce by his power
The young captain of the Gondor is about the ring to his own
And the world will fall
It is close now
So close to achieving his goal
For Sarumon will have the minion of all the ending of the world
The time of the elf is over
Do we live middle earth to it's faith?
Do we let them stand alone?
What use?
Our scout report Sarumon has attacked Rohan
Failed people has flee in Humsdeed
But we must look onto our own boarders
Orc are on the move
Sarumon is marching his army
Eastling is passing to the black gate
How many?
Some thousand comes everyday
Who covering the river to the North?
We put 500 man in the Osgilliatz
If it's attack we won't hold it
The Sarumon is attacking the Isengard
Sarumon from Mordor
The fight will come to man above front
Gondor is weak
Sarumon will strike us soon
And it will strike hard
He know he straight to the path
My men tells me that you are spy
Spy?
Wait just a minute
If you not a spy.
Then who are you?
Speak
We're Hobbins by the saier
Frodo Baggins is my name
And this is Sam Kenji
Your bodyguard?
He's gardener
Then where is your scouting friend?
The gang who with you?
Get new favor look

We set out from Rivendor with 7 companions
One.
We lost in memorial
Two of my kin
A dwarf that also and an elf
And two man.

You friend of Borodel?
Yes
From my part
To greet you then
To learn of his dead
Dead?
How?
.
When?
As one of his companion
I hope you will tell me
He was my brother
Captain Farameir
We found them
You must come with me
Now
No!
Stop it!
Leave it alone!
Don't you understand?
He's gonna destroy it!
That's where we're going?
Into Mordor
To the mountain of fire
Lord, we're under attack
We call for reinforcement
Please
It such a burden
Captain
Prepare to leave
The ring will go to Gondor
He's alive
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way
I got to kill him
You are the luckiest
The most reckless man I never knew
Bless you, buddy
Where is the King?
You look terrible
Great host you say
All indeed
How many?
10,000 strong at least
10,000?
It for break for a single purpose
To destroy the world of man
They be here by night fall
Let them come!
I want everyman in strong lab
Able their arm, to be ready for battle by night fall
We will be cover the courseway and the gate from above
No army have breach the deeping wall
Or step foot inside the Hornberg
This is all the mindless orc
These is orc kind.
Their armor is thick and their shield broad
I have fought many war, Master Wolf
I know how to defend my own keep
They will break upon the fortress like water and rock
Solomon herd will pillage and burn
We seen it before
Corpses can be resoul
House, rebuild
Between these wall
We will out last them
They not come to destroy the clan and the villages
They come to destroy people
And the last child
What you have me to do?
Look at my man
The courage has reach the red
And this will be our end
And I will make them such challenge
That will be the word of the remembrance
Sent out right, my Lord
You must cooperate
And who will come?
Elf?
Dwarf?
We not so lucky like our friend like you
The line is undead
-Gondor, Lord, sir
-Gondor!
Where was Gondor when the Westfull fell?
Where is Gondor when our enemy close and around us?
No.
My Lord have gone
We are alone
Get the women and the children to the cave
We have no time to the provision...
There is no time
War is upon us
Secure the gate
We ain't not trouble about the war of man and wizard
That's very long time
But now, something is to about happen
That's not happen for our live
That's the mortal
What's that?
It's a gathering
The gathering of what?
Many have come
Now, we must decide must we go to war
Move to the cave!
Farmer.
Fairies.
Stable boy
They ain't soldiers
Most of them never see winter
Or to feel
Look at them
Their fight
You can see in their eyes
Then I should die one of them
Let him go.
Let it be
Every villager able to will their sword
Has been sent to the armory
My Lord
How I would gambling?
You're our king, sir
And you trust your king
Your man, My Lord
Will follow you to what ever in
To what ever in
Where is the horse in a raider?
Where is the horn that is blowing?
They have pass grey and the mountains
My queen and the medal
The day have come and where it was
Behind the hills and the shadow
How did they come to this?
Give me a sword
What is your name?
Hallas
Son of Harmonmain
The man said, we're not give up a night
The villager is hopeless
This is a good sword
Hallas, son of the Harmonmain
There is always a hope
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elfron of River Death
And alliance once existed between Elf and Man
Long ago we fought and die together
We come to honor that a legion
Magowanin
You are most welcome
We were proud to fight alongside with mans once more
You gonna pick it up or what?
Your friends are with you, Aragon
That's hope will last a night
What happening out there?
As I describe to you
Would you like me to find you a box?
So it's begin
Is there a fight?
Give them a fire
Fire!
Fire!
I'm on seventeen
What?
You scoring me?
Nineteen
We have just agree to
Yes?
We have agree
You are not orc
Oh.
That a good news
What about Sarumon?
Have you come a decision about him?
Now don't be hasty about that
Hasty?
Our friends is out there
They need our help
They cannot fight this war on their own
War?
Yes
You must understand
Pick a long time to say anything
In all indeed
And we here not to say anything
And this is a worst thinking
A long time to say
Seventeen!
Nineteen!
Is this it?
This is all you can conquer, Sarumon?
Paste the gate
Hold them!
Stop them!
Aragon!
Hence, that cannot hold that with storm
We must weather such thing as we all have done
How can that be your decision?
This is not our war
But you a part of this world
Aren't you?
You must help, please
You must do some thing
You are young and brave, Master Merry
But you part in this state is over
Go back to your home
Maybe he is right
We don't belong here, Merry
It's too big for us
What we can do in the end?
We got the Saier
Maybe we should go home
Fire advise goggle
And the woods of Tugh Bro
Will burn
Once a good and green in this world will be gone
There won't be a Saier
Aragon!
Fall back to the keep!
To the gate
Draw your sword
We can't hold much longer
As long you can get me
Come on.
We can take them
Is a long way
Toast me
What?
I say you got to toast me!
Don't tell me else
Not a word
Shut the door!
Make way!
Make a barricade
Higher!
Aragon!
Get out of there!
Aragon!
Pull everybody back
Pull them back
They coming through
Retreat!
Retreat!
Hurry!
Get them inside
I will leave you at the Western board of this forest
You can make you way North to your homeland from there
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around
Yes.
Exactly
We can slip pass through Sarumon unnoticed
The close we out of danger
The further we from harm
The last thing he expect
That not make sense to me
But you are very strong
Perhaps, you right
Hold on, little child
I always like to doing so
Somehow, it feel like going down hill
Are you mad?
We will be caught
No.
We won't
Not.
This day
Look
Must given a burn
It has come
Ring will not save Gondor
It's only the tower to destroy
Please.
Let me go
Hurry!
Let me!
You must let me go!
You know little few mice will go
Some times climb up tickle it all from me
They always climb up to get somebody
All these tree is my friends
Creatures have no food
I'm sorry
Sarumon
How would you!
There is no close scenarios of the tone of man
I and eyes of god tonight with the rock and stone
Yes
Welcome, my friends
We are going to war
It like we going to our doom
Of the ends
Damian.
Taking the Eastern sore
Their number is too great
By night fall.
We will be over run
Frodo
It's coming to himself
His eye almost told me
Hold on Mr. Frodo
You be alright
Take him to my throne
Tell him, that is a mighty give
The weapon will change our fortune in this world
You don't know what happen in the bottom here
You want to know why your brother died?
He try to take the ring from Frodo
And he swearing to protect him
He try to kill him
The ring throw you brother mad
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo
They here
They come
Let's go!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight
Take cover
The fortress is taken
It is over
You say this fortress will not fall if we defend it
They sealed it
They have died for defending it
They breaking in
Is there anyway to get the women and the children out of the cave?
Is the other way?
There is one passage
It lead us to the mountains
But we will not get to far
They too many
Send word to the women and the children to the mountain path
And barricade the entrance
So much death
What can man do to a such reckless hates
Right out of me
Right out of me
Forget the glory
For Rohand
For your people
The sun is rising
The first light is coming of this day
Have all look to this
Yes
Yes
The horn of the Haman Hand
Shall sound in the deep
One last time
Yes!
This be the hour
Where we draw soul together
Feel deeds awake
Now for Rat
Now for ruin
And the red throne
Gandalf
Stand a King.
Stand a live
Not alone
Go hill up!
For the King!
A hit.
A fine Hit
Make haste
Very strong river
Hold on!
Hold on!
What you doing?
Where do you going?
It's me
It's your Sam
Don't you know Sam?
I can't do this, Sam
I know
It's all wrong
We not should be here
We are
It's like a queit story, Mr. Frodo
The one that really matter
Full of darkness and danger there were
Sometimes you don't want to know the end
Because I thought the end will be happy
How could the world goes back where it was
So much bad happened
But in the end
Only pass you think
The shadow
Even darkness must pass
The new day will come
And sunshine will shine out the clearer
Those the story will stay with you
That meant something
Even you were too small to understand why
But I think, Mr. Frodo
I do understand
I know no
Folken all those story
And a lot of chances to turn it back only they didn't
They kept going
Because they holding on something
What were we holding on, Sam?
There is some good in this world, Mr Frodo
And we were fighting for it
I think it last
We understand another Frodo Bagging
You know the law of our countries
The law of your father
If you let them go, your live will be for it
And it is for it
Release them
Sarumon lost will be terrible.
His reputation swept
The battle for him will be deep over
The battle for the middle earth will about to begin
For our hopes lies on the two little hobbins
Sarumon will be hopeless
Wonder if we were put in the song or tales
What?
I wonder if people ever say
Let hear about Frodo and the ring
And I will say, that my favorite story
Frodo really is a courages on what he have done
Yes, my boy
The most famous hobbins
And I said it alone
You left out a chief characters
Sam the brave
I would like to hear more about Sam
Frodo will not got so far without Sam
No, Mr. Frodo
You should make fun
Why so serious
So was I
Sam the Brave
Smigal!
Master broke his promise
Master betray us!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him both!
Then we take his precious
And we will be the master
But the fat Hobbins
He knows
I always watching
Then we stab them out
Put out his eyes
Make him crawl
Yes.
Yes.
Yes
Kill him both
Yes.
No.
No.
It's too risky.
It's too risky
Where he's going?
Alright, golem.
Where are you?
Smigal!
Do it
He's can do it
Yes, precious she could
And then we takes it
Once they get it
Once they get it
Come on, Hobbins
Don't waste to go yet
Smigal show you the way
Follow me
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war... grief... despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quicky, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
South Farthing
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
GANDALF".
You cannot pass!
FRODO'.
Gandalf!
GANDALF".
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udﬂn!
You shall not pass!
[ROARING]
[GRUNTS]
BOROMIR:
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
[ROARING AND YELLING]
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
[GRUNTS]
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
[YELLS]
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
SAM:
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
[RUMBLING]
[GASPING]
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
[THUNDER ROLLING]
SAM:
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
SAM:
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
[YELLING]
[SAM YELLS]
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
[SIGHS]
[WHIMPERS]
[GOLLUM SCREAMING]
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
[WHEEZING]
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
SMEAGOL:
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
GOLLUM:
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
SMEAGOt This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
PIPPIN:
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Ore-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
[LAUGHING]
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Huh?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
[RUMBLING]
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lérien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
ARAGORN:
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
ARAGORN:
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
LEGOLAS:
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
SARUMAN".
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
[YELLING AND SQUEALING]
SARUMAN".
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
SARUMAN:
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
ORC:
But, my lord, there are too many!
We cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a darn, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
WILD MAN:
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
SARUMAN:
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
SARUMAN:
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
[YELLING]
SARUMAN".
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
FREDA:
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
[SCREAMING]
Quickly!
Go, child.

Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théod red.
EOWYN:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THEODEN:
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
[GRUNTING]
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
[YELLS]
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
ORC 1:
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[GROANING]
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other...
"EVER move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
LEADER:
Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
[ROARING]
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.

No one's going to save you now.
[HORSES NEIGHING]
MERRY:
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
[HOOVES BEATING]
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would out off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gléin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
[WHISTLES]
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[YELLS]
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
MERRY:
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
[TREES GROANING]
PIPPIN:
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.

I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!

Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

[HOBBITS GRUNTING]
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
[HOBBITS GROANING]
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Half lings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
GOLLUM:
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes-
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
And we are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
GOLLUM:
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
[COUGHS]
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
SAM:
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
GOLLUM:
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
[FRODO GASPS]
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
FRODO:
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
[THUNDER ROLLING]
GOLLUM:
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
[FRODO GROANING]
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
SMEAGOL:
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
[ROARS]
SMEAGOt Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
[SCREECHING]
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
[ROARS]
SMEAGOt Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
[SPITS]
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
[TREES GROANING]
The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN:
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
[IN ELVISH] Something's out there.
[IN ELVISH] What do you see?
[IN ENGLISH] The White Wizard approaches.
[IN ENGLISH] Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
WHITE WIZARD:
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD:
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Ba/rog of Morgoth.
[ROARING AND YELLING]
GANDALF".
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
GIMLI:
Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested--?
[TREES GROANING]
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
-...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
[WHISTLING]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GAN DALF:
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD:
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Oh.
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dﬂr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of NUmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
SMEAGOt The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
SMEAGOL:
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
[HORNS BLOWING]
[ROARS]
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
SMEAGOL:
No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
[RUMBLING]
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
PIPPIN:
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
[GROANING]
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
[ENTISH GROAN]
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
'Who?
'YOu!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
[ENTISH GROAN] 3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
PIPPIN:
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
MERRY:
I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
[GRUNTING]
No!
PIPPIN:
Help!
TREEBEARD:
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
GANDALF:
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
EOWYN:
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
- Your staff.
- Hm?
Oh...
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
[DOOR LOCKS]
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Léthspell I name him.
I'll news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the Wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
RAUGHS]
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[GROANING]
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
SARUMAN:
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
[YELLING]
[GROANS]
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
[YELLS]
[GROANS]
WORMTONGUE:
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
WORMTONGUE:
Send me not from your sight.
ARAGORN:
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
WORMTONGUE:
Get out of my way!
MAN:
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théod red?
Where is my son?
[CHANTING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
THEODEN:
Simbelmyné.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
GANDALF:
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
[SPEAKING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
EOWYN:
Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
THEODEN:
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
[BURPS]
Then what is the king's decision?
HAMA:
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI:
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They Will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
[ARAGORN SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
[IN ELVISH] Your name is kingly.
[CONTINUES SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
WORMTONGUE:
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
-...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
SARUMAN:
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found lsildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
WORMTONGUE:
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
[GROWLING]
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM:
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
SMEAGOt No.
Not master.
GOLLUM:
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
SMEAGOt Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
SMEAGOt Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
[CHUCKLING]
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
[SMEAGOL SHRIEKING]
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling-
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
SAM:
Who are they?
SMEAGOL:
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
[OLIPHAUNT GROANS]
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
[GROANING]
No one at home will believe this.
[BIRD WHISTLES]
Sméagol?
[ARROWS FLYING]
[SCREAMING]
[OLIPHAUNTS TRUMPETING]
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
No!
- Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
- Travelers?
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
GIMLI:
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
[YELLS]
GIMLI:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
-It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the dunedain.
A descendant of NUmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
ARWEN:
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
[IN ELVISH] You told me once... this day would come.
[IN ELVISH] This is not the end...it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
[IN ENGLISH] Arvven...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust HS.
EOWYN:
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND'.
Our time here is ending.
Arm/en's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
[IN ELVISH] Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
[IN ELVISH] I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war...grief...despair.
[IN ENGLISH] Why are you saying this?
[IN ENGLISH] I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arvven.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
EOWYN:
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What is it?
- Héma?
- I'm not sure.
[YELLING AND ROARING]
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLI:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
[WARGS BARKING]
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLI:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
EOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLI:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
[SNIFFS]
[GRUNTING]
[YELLS]
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
[LAUGHING]
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... ."dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
[CHOKES]
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
WOMAN 1:
At last!
WOMAN 2:
Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 3:
There it is, Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 4:
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
FREDA:
Mama!
MORWEN:
Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
MAN:
Make way for the king.
GAMLING:
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING:
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
THEODEN:
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
WORMTONGUE".
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
SARUMAN:
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
SARUMAN:
Tens of thousands.
WORMTONGUE:
But, my lord, there is no such force.
[HORNS SOUNDING]
[ARMY CHEERING]
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
TREEBEARD:
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
ARWEN:
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
ELROND:
Arvven.
[IN ELVISH] It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
[IN ENGLISH] He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arvven.
There is nothing for you here only death.
[IN ELVISH] Do I not also have your love?
[IN ELVISH] You have my love, father.
[GALADRIEL SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
GALADRIEL [IN ENGLISH]:
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
[ROARING]
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
FARAMIR:
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gang rel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How'?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
[MEN CHEERING]
MEN:
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
DENETHOR:
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
-lsildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
-...send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
MAN:
Captain Faramir!
[WHISPERING] We found the third one.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool ls nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
[YELLS]
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
[FOOTSTEP]
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
[MUFFLED CRIES]
[GRUNTING AND PANTING]
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
[CRYING]
FARAMIR:
Answer me.
GOLLUM:
Sméagol.
[CRYING]
GOLLUM:
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
SMEAGOt Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
GOLLUM:
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
SMEAGOt Master is our friend.
Our friend.
GOLLUM:
Master betrayed us.
SMEAGOt No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
GOLLUM:
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
SMEAGOt No.
No.
What did they steal?
GOLLUM:
My precious!
[YELLS]
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Half lings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
[VOICE OF THE RING WHISPERING]
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
SAM:
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
[DISTANT MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
WOMAN:
He's alive!
GIMLI:
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
[IN ELVISH] You're late.
[IN ENGLISH] You look terrible.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[DOORS OPENING]
A great host, you say?
[IN ENGLISH] All lsengard is emptied.
How many?
ARAGORN:
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN:
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gen-l?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
MAN 1:
We need more time to lay provisions--
THEODEN:
There is no time.
War is upon us.
MAN 2:
Secure the gate.
[CAWING]
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
[RUMBLING]
TREEBEARD:
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
GUARD 1:
Move back!
Move to the caves!
GUARD 2:
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
[BABY CRYING]
EOWYN:
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
[BABY CRYING]
[MUTED SPEECH]
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
[IN ELVISH] And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
[IN ELVISH] They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
Aragorn.
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
[IN ENGLISH] Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLI:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
[ENTS GROANING]
Huh?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
TREEBEARD:
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
GUARD:
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Héma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Héma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
[IN ELVISH] There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
[HORN BLOWING]
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
GUARD:
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[INDISTINCT GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
GIMLI:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
[THUNDER ROLLS]
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[BABY CRYING]
[IN ELVISH] Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
[ROARS]
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
[U RU K-HAI BATTLE CRIES]
HOLD!
[GROANS]
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
[IN ELVISH] Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
[IN ENGLISH] Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
[IN ENGLISH] I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
[ENTS GROANING]
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War'?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
[ARAGORN SHOUTS IN ELVISH]
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
[IN ELVISH] Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH] Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
[ENTS GRUMBLING]
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING:
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
[IN ELVISH] To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
GIMLI:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
[SHOUTING IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
THEODEN:
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
-I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
MAN 1:
Make way!
MAN 2:
Follow me to the barricade.
MAN 1:
Watch our backs!
MAN 3:
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
MAN 4:
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
THEODEN:
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
GAMLING:
Fall back!
THEODEN:
Retreat!
ARAGORN:
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
THEODEN:
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past lsengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
MAN:
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
FRODO:
Faramir!
You must let me go!
TREEBEARD:
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
[GASPS]
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
[ROARING]
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
[GROANING AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Yes.
TREEBEARD:
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
N is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
[MUTED SPEECH]
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Ithilien RANGER:
Watch out!
[RUMBLING]
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Nazgou
[ROARING]
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
THEODEN:
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
WOMAN 1:
They're breaking in!
WOMAN 2:
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride outwith me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
GANDALF".
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.

I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
SAM:
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going--- ...because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
[HOOVES BEATING]
EOMER:
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
[SCREAMING AND YELLING]
Final count...
-...42.
- Forty-two?
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
MERRY:
He doesn't look happy, does he?
PIPPIN:
Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
[HOBBITS LAUGHING]
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
SMEAGOL: n is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
SAM:
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Nice master.
- Nice Hobbits.
SAM:
Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
[RUMBLING]
GANDALF:
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my b0)'-
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
FRODO:
Sméagol?
SAM:
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.
SMEAGOt Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
SAM:
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
FRODO:
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
I'm the servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the shadow!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
Nooooooooo!
Gandalf!
What is it Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle Earth we don't want to see any closer.
It's the one place we are trying to get to.
It's just where we cant get.
Let's face it Mr. Frodo.
We're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam.
...but they did.
Mr.Frodo?
It's the Ring isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Well, let me see.
Oh yes, lovely
Lembas bread!
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold to foreign food, but this elvish stuff is not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
Those rainclouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
That's because we've been here before!
We are going in circles!
Ah!
What's that 'orrid stink?
I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
Can you smell it?
Yes I can smell it.
We are not alone.
Those thieves!
Those filthy little thieves!
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us
My precious.
We hate them!
We hate them!
We want it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before!
haven't you, Gollum!
Release him or I'll cut your throat!
It burns!
It burns us!
Take it off!
-Quiet you!
It's hopeless!
Every Orc in Mordor will hear this racket!
-Let's tie him up and leave him!
-No!
That will kill us, kill us!
It's nothing more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
Now that I've seen him, I do pity him.
We be very nice to hobbits, you be nice to us.
We swear to do what you wants.
We swear!
There is no promise you make that I can trust.
We swear to serve the master of the precious.
We swear on on the precious.
Gollum, Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the preciouss.
I don't believe you!
Get down!
-Get down!
-Sam!
He was trying to trick us!
We let him go he'll throttle us into our sleep!
-Do you know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail!
Let's go!
Their pace quickens.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on Gimli!
Three day's and night's pursuit.
No food... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare Rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us, come!
Come Gimli!
We are gaining on them.
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous we are over short distances.
Rohan, home of the horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets it's will against us.
Legolas!
What does your elf eyes see?
The Orcs turn Northeast.
They are taking the hobbits to Isengard!
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard ...and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, Lord Sauron, ...we shall rule this Middle-Earth.
The old world will burn in the fires of industry.
Forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machinery of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the Orcs.
We now have only to remove those who oppose us.
The horsemen have taken your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of Rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in the Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
But Papa says Eothain must not ride.
He's too big for him!
Listen to me!
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm
-Do you understand me?
-Yes mum!
I don't wanna go!
I don't wanna go, mama!
Freda, listen to me.
I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child!
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred!
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie!
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grimá.
Grimá.
Grimá.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked, unchallenged, killing at will.
Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is weary of your malcontent.
...your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long has it been since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grimá?
When all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Èomer son of Èomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing, that's the key!
Breathe!
Ho!
They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We ain't goin' no further till we've had a breather.
Get the fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think, we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest?
On the borders of Buckland?
Folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
What about them?
They're flesh!
They are not for eating!
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
Ooh!
They look tasty!
Get back!
Just a mouthful?
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu boys!
Pippin!
Let's go!
Go on, call for help.
Squeal!
No one's gonna save you now!
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan!
What news from the Mark?
What business does an elf, a man, and a dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell!
I'm Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas from the Woodland realm
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, its King.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this land.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there they say as an old man.
Hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
We are not spies.
We track a band of Uruk-Hai westward across the plains.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Do you see two Hobbits with them?
They will be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
They are dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters.
Farewel.
Look for your friends, but do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their little belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here and the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here and were followed.
The belt!
Run!
OTracks lead away from the battle into...
Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drew them there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm gonna rip off both your little heads!
Come here!
Trees!
Climb a tree!
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot-hole in your belly.
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs!
It's talking Merry.The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
Treeherder!
Shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it Merry.
Don't encourage it.
Treebeard some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody is on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore..
We are not Orcs.
We are Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire they come with axes.
Biting, breaking, hacking, burning.
Destroyers and usurpers
Curse them!
No!
You don't understand.
We are Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shirefolk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't/
The White Wizard will know.
White Wizard?
Saruman!
See, see!
We have led you out!
Hurry, hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice hobbit.
It's a bog!
He's led us into a swamp!
Swamp, yes, yes!
Come master.
We will take you to safe paths, through the mist.
Come Hobbits, come.
We move quickly!
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it
They go round for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Swift and quickly.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water!
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and men and Orcs.
A great battle long ago.
The Dead Marshes.
Yes, yes!
That is the name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights!
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you alright?
So bright, so beautiful.
Ah precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master need to keep up his strength.
Who are you?
Musn't ask us it's name not his business.
Gollum, Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
Cold be heart and Rock and bone.
And call every traveller far from home.
He said your life was was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead.
You were not so different from a Hobbit once were you...
Sméagol?
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My...
My name
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
C'mon Frodo, C'mon!
They will see us!
They will see us
- I thought they were dead!
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for the precious
Mr. Frodo!
It's alright.
I'm here.
Hurry, hobbits!
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood!
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memories and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your axe.
Aragorn, something is out there!
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will out a spell on us!
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be!
You fell!
Through fire.... ...and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought him, the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me.... ...and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and each day was as long as a life age of the earth.But it was not the end
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf!
Gandalf?
Oh yes.
That's what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf!
I am Gandalf the White now.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of the journey is over, another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax
He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
My home.
I sleep in the forest here.
The roots of the mountains.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have gone wild and dangerous.
Anger is in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us that are left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw this.
Master says show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does what master says so.
I did.
We cannot get past them.
Look!
The gate, it's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam!
No!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there.
Now!
No!
No!
No master!
They catch you!
They catch you.
Don't take it to Him.
He wants the precious.
Always he's looking for it!
And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him.
But we musn't let him have it.
No!
There is another way.
More secret, and dark way.
Why haven't you spoke of this before?
Because master did not ask!
He is up to something.
Are you saying that there is another way to Mordor?
Yes.
There is a path and some stairs .
And then a tunnel.
He has led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no!
He's been true to his word.
No!
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always help.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld
Here lives the King of Rohan ...whose mind is overthrown... and Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son is dead
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
He must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand his passing is hard to accept.
especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, you snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
The bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you
So fair.
So cold.
like a morning pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
This place is as cheerful as a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden-king so armed, Gandalf Grayhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
Oh.
No, you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
My Lord.
Gandalf the Grey is coming.
A herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden-King.
He is not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf, Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question my lord.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Silence!
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not come here to bandy words with a witless worm.
Your staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff!
Théoden Son of Thengel too long have you sat in shadows.
I would stay still if I were you!
I will release you from the spell.
You have no powers here Gandalf the Grey
I shall draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine!
Be gone!
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn!
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark my dreams have been of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you my lord.
Your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your side!
No my Lord!
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden, King!
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
it's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
it's the Ring, isn't it?
it's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
it's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
it's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
it burns!
it burns us!
it freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
it's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
it's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
it will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the Iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
it will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
it's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
- Carve them up!
- Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
it has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
it's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
it's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
it's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
it's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
it cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life In me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
My home lies deep In the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
it's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Worm tongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Storm crow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lath spell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leech craft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my fore bearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the West fold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
it's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
it is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
it's the Ring he wants.
it's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
it's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
it's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
it's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
it was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
it ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
it won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
it's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Bind their hands.
it's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
it's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
it's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
it was deliberate.
The light of the Even star does not wax and wane.
it is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
it was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
it was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
its outer wall is sold rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
it's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an Image of the splendor of the kings of Men In glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on In darkness and In doubt as nightfall In winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is falling.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
it is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
it works hard now to find its way back Into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
it is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easter lings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
it will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please. it's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
it is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
- Keep moving.
- Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind In the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills Into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
it's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
it affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
is this it?
is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
it's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuck borough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
it's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
it's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shire lings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
it has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
it is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
it's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
it is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
is there no other way?
There is one passage.
it leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammer hand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
it's me.
it's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
it's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
it's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But In the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even If you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere In the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
it's too risky. it's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world Is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Mlddle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the Iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord Is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what Iles ahead When sun has falled and moon Is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But It was not the end.
I felt life In me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind Is In the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land Is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind Is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over Klng Théoden Is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It Is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before... haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears... to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on... on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes... on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord... is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further... until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper... talk to each other... even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful... a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan... what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say... as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace after death.)
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle... into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are... and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us... it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory... and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Aragorn, nad no ennas!
(Aragorn, something is out there!
)
Man cenich?
(What do you see?
)
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire... and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me... and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead... and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back... until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now... at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming... quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses... and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest... near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning... we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it... has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed... and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path... and some stairs.
And then... a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then... you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son... he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king... to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... in the bitter watches of the night... when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring... still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden... son of Thengel... too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you... from the spell.
You have no power here...
Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
I've only... ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
"Bealocwealm hafað fréone frecan forth onsended... ("An evil death has set forth the noble warrior...) ...giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende."
(...
A song shall sing sorrowing minstrels.")
"On Meduselde...
("In Meduseld...) ...þæt he ma no wære...
(...that he is no more...) ...is þurh niedig rest." (...for his necessary rest.")
"And mægen deorost...
(And that he is the dearest kinsman...) ...bealo..." (...killing took him...")
Simbelmyn?
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
"Westu hái." ("Be thou well.")
"Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu." ("Go thou, Théodred, go thou.)
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me... but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king... the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
Fæste...
(Fast...) ...stille nú.
(...quiet now.)
Fæste...
(Fast...)
Stille...
(Quiet...) ...stille...
(...quiet...) ...stille...
(...quiet...) ...stille...
(...quiet...)
Lac is drefed, gefrægon.
(A battle is stirring, you heard.)
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?
)
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?
)
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Ðin nama is cynglic.
(Your name is kingly.)
Man le trasta, Brego?
(What troubles you, Brego?
)
Man cenich?
(What did you see?
)
I have heard of the magic of Elves... but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell... for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings... a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep... the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now... and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will... behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw... and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is... where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief... that there are no Dwarf women... and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.

(You cannot falter now.)
Arwen...

(If you trust nothing else...) ...estelio han...
(...trust this...) ...estelio ammen.
(...trust us.)
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.

)

(...away from war...grief, despair.)
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock... but for a small culvert at its base... which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning... thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night... the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising... from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time... when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal... and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
Tollen i lû.
(It is time.)
I chair gwannar na Valannor.
Si bado, no círar. (The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now before it is too late.)
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king... and all that you hope for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you... no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death... an image of the splendor of the kings of Men... in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt... as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell... bound to your grief under the fading trees... until all the world is changed... and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here... only death.
A im ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(And I, do I not have your love?
)
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.
(You have my love, father.)
I amar prestar aen.
(The world is changed.)
Han mathon ne nen.
(I feel it in the water.)
Han mathon ne chae, (I feel it in the earth,) a han noston ned 'wilith.
(and I smell it in the air.)
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman... to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor... the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand... the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth... even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria... two were my kin... a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...
I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
Isildur's Bane.
It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please... let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on... he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you... two Halflings... and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor... to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend.)
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest... and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
Le abdollen.
(You're late.)
You look terrible.
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms... to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall... or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown... homes rebuilt.
Within these walls... we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people... down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end... as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn... we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled... about the wars of Men and wizards... for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen... that has not happened... for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents... will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Boe a hyn (And they should be)
Neled herain...
(Three Hundred...) ...dan caer menig (...against Ten Thousand)
Si beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.
(They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras)
Aragorn nedin dagor hen ú-'erir ortheri.
(Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.)
Natha daged dhaer.
(They are all going to die!
)
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord... will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West... behind the hills... into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying... good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama... there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas.
(There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
Mae govannen, Haldir!
(Well met, Haldir!
)
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
A Eruchîn...
(O, Children of Eru...) ...ú-dano i faelas a hyn...
(...show them no mercy...) ...an uben tanatha le faelas.
(...for you shall receive none!
)
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
Dartho!
(Hold!
)
So it begins.
Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!
)
Faeg i-varv...
(Their armour is weak...) ...dîn na lanc...
(...at the throat...) ...a nu ranc.
(...and beneath the arm.)
Leithio i philinn!
(Fire the arrows!
)
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Pendraith!
(Ladders!
)
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot... and we have agreed... you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit... it takes a long time... to say anything in Old Entish... and we never say anything... unless it is worth taking... a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Towards the causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Togo han dad, Legolas!
(Bring him down, Legolas!
)
Dago hon!
(Kill him!
)
Dago hon!
(Kill him!
)
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Hado i philinn!
(Hurl the arrows!
)
Herio!
(Charge!
)
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread... and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Am Marad!
(To the Keep!
)
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
Haldir!
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then... you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please... let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
Entish or the tongues of Men... for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight... with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely... that we go to our doom.
Last march... of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn... look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand... shall sound in the Deep... one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath... now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was... when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going... because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching... because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee... where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path... near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo... they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Flre, wlelder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world Is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Mlddle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the Iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord Is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what Iles ahead When sun has falled and moon Is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But It was not the end.
I felt life In me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind Is In the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land Is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind Is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over Klng Théoden Is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It Is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It Is mine to give to whom I wlll.
Llke my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here Is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall Is solid rock but for a small culvert at Its base which Is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an Image of the splendor of the kings of Men In glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you wlll Ilnger on In darkness and In doubt as nightfall In winter that comes without a star.
Here you wlll dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world Is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy Is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
Hls war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Rlng Is close.
The strength of the Rlng-bearer Is falllng.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen It.
It Is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Rlng grows strong.
It works hard now to find Its way back Into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by Its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Rlng for his own, and the world will fall.
It Is close now.
So close to achieving Its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves Is over.
Do we leave Mlddle-earth to Its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Llke wind In the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills Into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way It was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But In the end, It's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, It will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even If you were too small to understand why.
But I thlnk, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere In the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war... grief... despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quicky, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
South Farthing
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before... haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears... to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on... on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes... on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord... is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further... until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper... talk to each other... even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful... a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan... what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say... as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle... into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are... and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us... it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory... and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire... and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me... and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead... and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back... until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now... at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming... quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses... and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest... near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning... we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it... has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed... and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path... and some stairs.
And then... a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then... you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son... he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king... to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... in the bitter watches of the night... when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring... still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden... son of Thengel... too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you... from the spell.
You have no power here...
Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
I've only... ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyn?
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me... but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king... the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves... but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell... for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings... a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep... the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now... and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will... behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw... and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is... where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief... that there are no Dwarf women... and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock... but for a small culvert at its base... which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning... thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night... the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising... from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time... when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal... and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king... and all that you hope for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you... no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death... an image of the splendor of the kings of Men... in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt... as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell... bound to your grief under the fading trees... until all the world is changed... and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here... only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman... to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor... the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand... the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth... even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria... two were my kin... a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...
I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please... let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on... he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you... two Halflings... and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor... to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest... and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms... to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall... or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown... homes rebuilt.
Within these walls... we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people... down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end... as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn... we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled... about the wars of Men and wizards... for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen... that has not happened... for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents... will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord... will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West... behind the hills... into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying... good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama... there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot... and we have agreed... you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit... it takes a long time... to say anything in Old Entish... and we never say anything... unless it is worth taking... a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread... and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then... you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please... let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
Entish or the tongues of Men... for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight... with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely... that we go to our doom.
Last march... of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn... look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand... shall sound in the Deep... one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath... now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was... when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going... because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching... because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee... where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path... near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo... they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
D
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udùn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
- Carve them up!
- Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has falled and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end...it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
You have a chance for another life... away from war...grief...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now...before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is falling.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
- Keep moving.
- Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgùl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy."
"The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.

I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
.
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
.
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
-What's in this?
.
-Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
.!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
.
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
.
It's the Ring, isn't it?
.
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
.
-Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
.
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
.
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
-Can you smell it?
.
-Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
.
Where is it?
.
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
.
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
-Get down!
I said, down!
-Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
-You know the way to Mordor?
.
-Yes.
You've been there before?
.
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
.
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
.
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
.
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
-Leave him alone!
-Why?
.
You want some?
.
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
-You're hurt.
-I'm fine.
-lt was just an act.
-An act?
.
See?
.
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
.
What do you smell?
.
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
.
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
-Burn it.
-Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
-Do you understand me?
.
-Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
-Mordor will pay for this.
-These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
.
Can you not see?
.
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
.
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
.
What was the promised price, Grima?
.
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
.
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
.
It's the trees.
What?
.
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
.
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
.
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
.!
What about them?
.
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
.
They don't need those.
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
.
Why alive?
.
Do they give good sport?
.
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
.
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
.
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
.
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
.
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
.
What madness drove them in there?
.
Did we lose him?
.
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
.
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
.
Side?
.
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
.
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
-Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
-No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
.
Saruman.
See?
.
See?
.
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
.
Is it tasty?
.
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
.
-Don't follow the lights.
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you all right?
.
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
.
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
-Who are you?
.
-Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
.
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
.
That was your name once, wasn't it?
.
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
-I thought they were dead.
-Dead?
.
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
.
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
.
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
.
Who are you?
.
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
.
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
-We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
-Edoras?
.
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
.
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested--?
.
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
-...and find that they are strong.
-Strong?
.!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
-ls it much further?
.
-Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
.
Did he, indeed?
.
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
-I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
-Now!
-No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
.
-Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
.
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
.
Treebeard?
.
Where has he gone?
.
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
.
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
-Who?
.
-You!
-Than what?
.
-Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
.
Three-foot-six?
.
At the most?
.
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
-I want some!
-lt could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
.!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
.
-Are there Ent children?
.
-Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
-Why is that?
.
-We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
-How did they die?
.
-Die?
.
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
.
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
.
What do they look like?
.
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
.
Uncle?
.
Will you not go to him?
.
Will you do nothing?
.
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
.
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
.
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
.
Where is my son?
.
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
.
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
.
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
.
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
-...was he from Gondor?
.
-No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found lsildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:.
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
.
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
-Why do you do that?
.
-What?
.
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
.
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
.
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
-You have to fight it.
-I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
.
Don't you know who you sound like?
.
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
.
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
.
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
.
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
.
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
.
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
.
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
.
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
.
What's taters?
.
Eh?
.
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
.
-Who are they?
.
-Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
-Ready to do what?
.
-To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
.
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
.
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
-It's good.
-Really?
.
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
.
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen....
Where is she?
.
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
.
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
.
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
.
-Hama?
.
-I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
-What is it?
.
What do you see?
.
-Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
-I can fight.
-No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
-Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!
-That's it!
Go on!
-Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
.
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
-Mama!
-Eothain!
Freda!
-Where is the rest?
.
-This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
.
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
.
The women and children?
.
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
.
How can fire undo stone?
.
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
.
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
.
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
.
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
.
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
.
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
-How many?
.
-Some thousands.
More come every day.
-Who's covering the river to the north?
.
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
.
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
.
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
.
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
.
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
.
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
.
How?
.
When?
.
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
.
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
.
Where is he?
.
Where is Gondor's finest?
.
Where's my first-born?
.
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
.
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
-He loves you, Father.
-Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
-lsildur's Bane.
-lt has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
-Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
-Would you deny your own father?
.
-lf there is need to go to Rivendell...
-...send me in his stead.
-You?
.
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
.
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
.
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
.
Answer me.
Smeagol.
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
.
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
.
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but....
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo....
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
.
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
.
Captain?
.
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
-He's alive!
-Where is he?
.
Where is he?
.
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
.
-All lsengard is emptied.
-How many?
.
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
.
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
.
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
.
Elves?
.
Dwarves?
.
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?
.!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
.!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
.!
Where was Gon--?
.
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions--
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
.
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
.
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
.
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
.
-Let me stand at your side.
-lt is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
.
Who am I, Gamling?
.
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
.
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
.
Where is the horn that was blowing?
.
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
.
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
.
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
.
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
.
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
-What's happening out there?
.
-Shall I describe it to you?
.
Or would you like me to find you a box?
.
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
.
Give them a volley.
-Fire!
-Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 1 7!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
.
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
.
Have you come to a decision about him?
.
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
.
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
.
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
.
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
.
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
.!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
.!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
.
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And....
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
.
What are you stopping for?
.
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?
.
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
-What?
.
-I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
-Fall back!
-Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
-Turn around.
Take us south.
-South?
.
But that will lead you past lsengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
.
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they....
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
.
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
.
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
.
You want to know why your brother died?
.
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
.
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
.
Is there no other way?
.
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
.
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
.
Where are you going?
.
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
.
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
.
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
.
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
-...42.
-Forty-two?
.
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
-Forty-three.
-He was already dead.
-He was twitching.
-He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
-He doesn't look too happy, does he?
.
-Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
-What are you doing?
.
-Nothing.
-The world's back to normal, that's all.
-No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
-lt is!
-Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
.
Share it?
.
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
.
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
.
-ls that its name?
.
-No.
No!
-Yes.
-Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
-You cannot go that way.
-lt is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
.
He was trying to save you, see?
.
Save me?
.
So there's no hard feelings.
-Forgive and forget.
-No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
-Nice Hobbits.
-Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
.
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?
. "
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
.
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
.
Where has he gone?
.
-Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
.
-Smeagol?
.
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Flre, wlelder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middleearth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
What food have we got left?
Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
Can you smell it?
Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
Take it off us!
Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
Let's just tie him up and leave him.
No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
Get down!
I said, down!
Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
You know the way to Mordor?
Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Manflesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on crosscountry.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horselords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elfeyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world Is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Mlddleearth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the Iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The horsemen took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
Do you understand me?
Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord Is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
They look tasty.
Get back, scum!
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Urukhai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A treeherder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shirefolk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
Gollum?
Don't follow the lights.
Gollum!
Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
Who are you?
Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the riverfolk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what Iles ahead When sun has falled and moon Is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
I thought they were dead.
Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But It was not the end.
I felt life In me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
My home Iles deep In the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
Now!
No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
Why haven't you spoken of this before?
Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind Is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over Klng Théoden Is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It Is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Wargriders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
Why do you do that?
What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
You have to fight it.
I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Potatoes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
Who are they?
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
Ready to do what?
To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It Is mine to give to whom I wlll.
Llke my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end...it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here Is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
She stays because she still has hope.
She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
You have a chance for another life... away from war...grief...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elfkind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
Hama?
I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
What is it?
What do you see?
Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
I can fight.
No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
Make for the lower ground!
That's it!
Go on!
Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
At last!
Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
Mama!
Eothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall Is solid rock but for a small culvert at Its base which Is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now...before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an Image of the splendor of the kings of Men In glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you wlll Ilnger on In darkness and In doubt as nightfall In winter that comes without a star.
Here you wlll dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world Is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy Is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
Hls war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Rlng Is close.
The strength of the Rlngbearer Is falling.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen It.
It Is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Rlng grows strong.
It works hard now to find Its way back Into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by Its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Rlng for his own, and the world will fall.
It Is close now.
So close to achieving Its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves Is over.
Do we leave Mlddleearth to Its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
How many?
Some thousands.
More come every day.
Who's covering the river to the north?
We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an illfavored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
All Isengard is emptied.
How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Urukhai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
Gondor will answer.
Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Keep moving.
Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
Most have seen too many winters.
Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Llke wind In the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills Into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
Open the gate!
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
What's happening out there?
Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
Fire!
Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointyear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twentyone!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
Hold them!
How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
What?
I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
Turn around.
Take us south.
South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Urukhai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
And barricade the entrance!
So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way It was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But In the end, It's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, It will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even If you were too small to understand why.
But I thlnk, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middleearth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere In the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.

Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
[RUMBLES]
[GASPING]
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
Those rain clouds might.
SAM:
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
SAM:
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
FRODO:
Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
[SNORING]
[GROWLING]
The thieves.

It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!

He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
[RUMBLING]
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
[GIMLI GROANS]
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
ARAGORN:
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
ARAGORN:
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
LEGOLAS:
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
[HAMMERING]
SARUMAN:
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
[YELLING AND SQUEALING]
SARUMAN:
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
SARUMAN:
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
[YELLING]
SARUMAN:
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
[SCREAMING]
Quickly!
Go, child.
SARUMAN:
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
ÉOWYN:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THÉODEN:
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
[GROANS]
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
[YELLS]
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
ORC 1:
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[TREES GROANING]
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
[WHIMPERING]
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
LEADER:
Get back, scum!
ORC 2:
Carve them up!
ORC 3:
Just a mouthful.

No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

[HOOVES BEATING]
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
[WHISTLES]
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[YELLS]
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
[TREES GROANING]
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
[YELLING]
They ran over here.
They were followed.
MERRY:
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
PIPPIN:
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
[GROWLING]
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
[GROWLING]
Merry!
[GROANING]
[SCREAMS]
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Hmm.
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
[MERRY AND PIPPIN GROANING]
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
GOLLUM:
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
SAM:
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
SAM:
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
GOLLUM:
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Oh.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
[GASPING]
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
FRODO:
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
[THUNDER ROLLING]
GOLLUM:
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
Sméagol.
[SHRIEKING IN THE DISTANCE]
Black Riders!
SMÉAGOL:
Hide!
Hide!
[SCREAMING]
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
SMÉAGOL:
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
[SHRIEKING]
[ROARING]
[SMÉAGOL WHIMPERS]
SMÉAGOL:
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
[ROARING]
SMÉAGOL:
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
[TREES GROANING] ...and anger.
[GROANING]
The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN:
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Oh.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
[YELLING]
WHITE WIZARD:
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
[GASPS]
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
[WHISTLING]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GANDALF:
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD:
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
SMÉAGOL:
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
SMÉAGOL:
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
[HORNS BLOWING]
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
[RUMBLING]
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
GANDALF:
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
ÉOWYN:
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
[RIPPING]
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
[LAUGHING]
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
[THÉODEN WHIMPERS]
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[GROANING]
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
[YELLING]
[GROANS]
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
[YELLS]
[GROANS]
WORMTONGUE:
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
[SCREAMS]
ARAGORN:
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
WORMTONGUE:
Get out of my way!
MAN:
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
GANDALF:
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
[SPEAKING IN ROHIRRIM]
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head-on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
THÉODEN:
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
[BURPS]
Then what is the king's decision?
HÁMA:
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI:
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
WORMTONGUE:
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
[GROWLING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM:
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
SMÉAGOL:
No.
Not master.
GOLLUM:
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
SMÉAGOL:
Master's my friend.
GOLLUM:
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
[GROWLS]
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
SMÉAGOL:
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
[CHUCKLING]
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
[SMÉAGOL SHRIEKING]
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
SAM:
Who are they?
SMÉAGOL:
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
[OLIPHAUNT GROANS]
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
Sméagol?
[SCREAMING]
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Aye!
[GROANING]
Bind their hands.
GIMLI:
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
[GIMLI YELLS]
GIMLl:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
ARWEN:
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
[IN ELVISH]
Arwen...
ÉOWYN:
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND:
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
ÉOWYN:
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
[YELLING AND ROARING]
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLl:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
[BARKING]
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLl:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
ÉOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!

Aragorn!
Aragorn?
[LAUGHING]
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
[LAUGHING AND CHOKING]
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
WOMAN 1:
At last!
WOMAN 2:
Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 3:
There it is, Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 4:
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
FREDA:
Mama!
MORWEN:
Éothain!
Freda!
GAMLING:
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLl:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING:
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
THÉODEN:
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
WORMTONGUE:
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
SARUMAN:
Tens of thousands.
WORMTONGUE:
But, my lord, there is no such force.
[HORNS SOUNDING]
[ARMY CHEERING]
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
TREEBEARD:
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
ARWEN:
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
ELROND:
Arwen.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
[IN ELVISH]
[GALADRIEL SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
GALADRIEL:
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
[ROARING]
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
FARAMIR:
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
MAN:
Captain Faramir!
[WHISPERING] We found the third one.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
[YELLS]
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.

Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

FARAMIR:

GOLLUM:

Why does it cry, Sméagol?
SMÉAGOL:
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
GOLLUM:
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
SMÉAGOL:
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
GOLLUM:
Master betrayed us.
SMÉAGOL:
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
GOLLUM:
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
SMÉAGOL:
No.
No.
What did they steal?
GOLLUM:
My precious!
[YELLS]
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
[VOICE OF THE RING WHISPERING]
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
SAM:
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
[DISTANT MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
WOMAN:
He's alive!
GIMLI:
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] You look terrible.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
[DOORS OPENING]
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
ARAGORN:
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN:
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
MAN 1:
We need more time to lay provisions...
THÉODEN:
There is no time.
War is upon us.
MAN 2:
Secure the gate.
[CAWING]
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
[RUMBLING]
TREEBEARD:
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
GUARD 1:
Move back!
Move to the caves!
GUARD 1:
Keep moving.
GUARD 2:
Quickly now.
[BABY CRYING]
[MUTED SPEECH]
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
[IN ELVISH]
Aragorn.
[IN ENGLISH] Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
GUARD:
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
[IN ELVISH]
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
[HORN BLOWING]
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
GUARD:
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[INDISTINCT GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
[THUNDER ROLLS]
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[BABY CRYING]
ARAGORN [IN ELVISH]:
[ROARS]
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
[URUK-HAI BATTLE CRIES]
[IN ELVISH]
[GROANS]
So it begins.
[IN ELVISH]
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
Send them to me!
Come on!
[IN ELVISH]
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
Huh?
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
[ENTS GROANING]
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two and 23!
Causeway!
[ARAGORN SHOUTS IN ELVISH]
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
[IN ELVISH]
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
[ENTS GRUMBLING]
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING:
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
[IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
GIMLl:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
[SHOUTING IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
THÉODEN:
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Oh, come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
[STAMMERS]
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
MAN 1:
Make way!
MAN 2:
Follow me to the barricade.
MAN 1:
Watch our backs!
MAN 3:
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
MAN 4:
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
GAMLING:
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
Retreat!
ARAGORN:
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
THÉODEN:
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
MAN:
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
FRODO:
Faramir!
You must let me go!
TREEBEARD:
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
[GASPS]
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
[ROARING]
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
[GROANING AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Yes.
TREEBEARD:
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
[MUTED SPEECH]
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
ITHILIEN RANGER:
Watch out!
[RUMBLING]
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
THÉODEN:
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
WOMAN 1:
They're breaking in!
WOMAN 2:
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
GANDALF:
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
[HORN BLOWS]
Forth Eorlingas!
[BATTLE CRIES]
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
[GRUNTS]
[ENTS ROARING]
TREEBEARD:
A hit.
A fine hit.
[TREEBEARD GRUNTS]
TREEBEARD:
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
[RUMBLING]
[ROARING]
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
[PANTING]
[SWORD CLANGS]
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
SAM:
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
[RUMBLING]
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
FRODO:
Sméagol?
SAM:
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.
SMÉAGOL:
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
SAM:
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
FRODO:
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before... haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears... to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on... on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes... on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord... is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further... until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper... talk to each other... even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful... a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan... what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say... as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace after death.)
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle... into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are... and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us... it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory... and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Aragorn, nad no ennas!
(Aragorn, something is out there!
)
Man cenich?
(What do you see?
)
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire... and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me... and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead... and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back... until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now... at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming... quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses... and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest... near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning... we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it... has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed... and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path... and some stairs.
And then... a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then... you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son... he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king... to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... in the bitter watches of the night... when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring... still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden... son of Thengel... too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you... from the spell.
You have no power here...
Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
I've only... ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
"Bealocwealm hafað fréone frecan forth onsended...
("An evil death has set forth the noble warrior...) ...giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende." (...
A song shall sing sorrowing minstrels.")
"On Meduselde...
("In Meduseld...) ...þæt he ma no wære...
(...that he is no more...) ...is þurh niedig rest." (...for his necessary rest.")
"And mægen deorost...
(And that he is the dearest kinsman...) ...bealo..." (...killing took him...")
Simbelmyn?
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
"Westu hái." ("Be thou well.")
"Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu." ("Go thou, Théodred, go thou.)
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me... but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king... the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
Fæste...
(Fast...) ...stille nú.
(...quiet now.)
Fæste...
(Fast...)
Stille...
(Quiet...) ...stille...
(...quiet...) ...stille...
(...quiet...) ...stille...
(...quiet...)
Lac is drefed, gefrægon.
(A battle is stirring, you heard.)
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?
)
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?
)
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Ðin nama is cynglic.
(Your name is kingly.)
Man le trasta, Brego?
(What troubles you, Brego?
)
Man cenich?
(What did you see?
)
I have heard of the magic of Elves... but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell... for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings... a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep... the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now... and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will... behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw... and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is... where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief... that there are no Dwarf women... and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.

The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.

(You underestimate your skill in battle.)
Ethelithach.
(You will return.)
Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.
(I do not speak of death in battle.)
O man pedich?
(What do you speak of?
)
Edra le men...
(The way is open to you...) ...men na guil edwen...
(...the way to another life...) ...haer o auth...a nîr a naeth.
(...away from war...grief, despair.)
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock... but for a small culvert at its base... which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning... thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night... the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising... from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time... when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal... and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
Tollen i lû.
(It is time.)
I chair gwannar na Valannor.
Si bado, no círar.
(The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now before it is too late.)
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king... and all that you hope for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you... no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death... an image of the splendor of the kings of Men... in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt... as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell... bound to your grief under the fading trees... until all the world is changed... and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here... only death.
A im ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(And I, do I not have your love?
)
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.
(You have my love, father.)
I amar prestar aen.
(The world is changed.)
Han mathon ne nen.
(I feel it in the water.)
Han mathon ne chae, (I feel it in the earth,) a han noston ned 'wilith.
(and I smell it in the air.)
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman... to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor... the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand... the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth... even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria... two were my kin... a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...
I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please... let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on... he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you... two Halflings... and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor... to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend.)
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest... and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
Le abdollen.
(You're late.)
You look terrible.
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms... to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall... or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown... homes rebuilt.
Within these walls... we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people... down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end... as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn... we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled... about the wars of Men and wizards... for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen... that has not happened... for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents... will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Boe a hyn (And they should be)
Neled herain...
(Three Hundred...) ...dan caer menig (...against Ten Thousand)
Si beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.
(They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras)
Aragorn nedin dagor hen ú-'erir ortheri.
(Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.)
Natha daged dhaer.
(They are all going to die!
)
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord... will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West... behind the hills... into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying... good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama... there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas.
(There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
Mae govannen, Haldir!
(Well met, Haldir!
)
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
A Eruchîn...
(O, Children of Eru...) ...ú-dano i faelas a hyn...
(...show them no mercy...) ...an uben tanatha le faelas.
(...for you shall receive none!
)
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
Dartho!
(Hold!
)
So it begins.
Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!
)
Faeg i-varv...
(Their armour is weak...) ...dîn na lanc...
(...at the throat...) ...a nu ranc.
(...and beneath the arm.)
Leithio i philinn!
(Fire the arrows!
)
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Pendraith!
(Ladders!
)
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot... and we have agreed... you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit... it takes a long time... to say anything in Old Entish... and we never say anything... unless it is worth taking... a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Towards the causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Togo han dad, Legolas!
(Bring him down, Legolas!
)
Dago hon!
(Kill him!
)
Dago hon!
(Kill him!
)
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Hado i philinn!
(Hurl the arrows!
)
Herio!
(Charge!
)
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread... and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Am Marad!
(To the Keep!
)
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
Haldir!
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then... you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please... let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
Entish or the tongues of Men... for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight... with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely... that we go to our doom.
Last march... of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn... look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand... shall sound in the Deep... one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath... now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was... when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going... because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching... because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee... where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path... near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo... they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before... haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears... to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on... on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes... on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord... is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further... until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper... talk to each other... even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful... a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan... what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say... as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle... into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are... and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us... it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory... and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire... and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me... and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead... and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back... until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
And I come back to you now... at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming... quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses... and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest... near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning... we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it... has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed... and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path... and some stairs.
And then... a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then... you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son... he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king... to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... in the bitter watches of the night... when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring... still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden... son of Thengel... too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you... from the spell.
You have no power here...
Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
I've only... ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyn?
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me... but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king... the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves... but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell... for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings... a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep... the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now... and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will... behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw... and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is... where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief... that there are no Dwarf women... and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock... but for a small culvert at its base... which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning... thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night... the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising... from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time... when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal... and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king... and all that you hope for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you... no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death... an image of the splendor of the kings of Men... in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt... as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell... bound to your grief under the fading trees... until all the world is changed... and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here... only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman... to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor... the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand... the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth... even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria... two were my kin... a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...
I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please... let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on... he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you... two Halflings... and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor... to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest... and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms... to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall... or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown... homes rebuilt.
Within these walls... we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people... down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end... as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn... we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled... about the wars of Men and wizards... for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen... that has not happened... for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents... will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord... will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West... behind the hills... into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying... good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama... there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot... and we have agreed... you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit... it takes a long time... to say anything in Old Entish... and we never say anything... unless it is worth taking... a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread... and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then... you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please... let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
Entish or the tongues of Men... for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight... with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely... that we go to our doom.
Last march... of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn... look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand... shall sound in the Deep... one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath... now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was... when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going... because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching... because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee... where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path... near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo... they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.

Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
[GRUNTS]
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
[YELLS]
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
SAM:
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
[RUMBLING]
[GASPING]
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
[THUNDER ROLLING]
SAM:
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
SAM:
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

[SAM YELLS]

[GOLLUM SCREAMING]
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
[WHEEZING]
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
SMÉAGOL:
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
GOLLUM:
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
SMÉAGOL This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
PIPPIN:
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
[LAUGHING]
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Huh?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
[RUMBLING]
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
ARAGORN:
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
ARAGORN:
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
LEGOLAS:
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
SARUMAN:
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
[YELLING AND SQUEALING]
SARUMAN:
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
SARUMAN:
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
ORC:
But, my lord, there are too many!
We cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
WILD MAN:
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
SARUMAN:
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
SARUMAN:
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
[YELLING]
SARUMAN:
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
FREDA:
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.

ÉOWYN:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THÉODEN:
Grima.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
[GRUNTING]
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.

Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
ORC 1:
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[GROANING]
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
LEADER:
Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
[ROARING]
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.

MERRY:
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
[HOOVES BEATING]
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gléin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
[WHISTLES]
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[YELLS]
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
MERRY:
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
[TREES GROANING]
PIPPIN:
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
[SNARLING]
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
[GROWLING]
Merry!
[GROANS]
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
[HOBBITS GRUNTING]
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
[HOBBITS GROANING]
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Half lings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
GOLLUM:
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, Yes-
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
And we are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
GOLLUM:
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
[COUGHS]
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
SAM:
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
GOLLUM:
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
[FRODO GASPS]
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
FRODO:
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
[THUNDER ROLLING]
GOLLUM:
80 bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
[FRODO GROANING]
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
SMÉAGOL:
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
[ROARS]
SMÉAGOL:
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
[SCREECHING]
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
[ROARS]
SMÉAGOL:
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
[SPITS]
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
[TREES GROANING]
The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN:
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
[IN ELVISH] Something's out there.
[IN ELVISH] What do you see?
[IN ENGLISH] The White Wizard approaches.
[IN ENGLISH] Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
WHITE WIZARD:
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD:
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
[ROARING AND YELLING]
GANDALF:
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
GIMLI:
Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested--?
[TREES GROANING]
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
-...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
[WHISTLING]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GANDALF:
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD:
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Oh.
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Númenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
SMÉAGOL:
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
SMÉAGOL:
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
[HORNS BLOWING]
[ROARS]
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
SMÉAGOL:
No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
[RUMBLING]
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
PIPPIN:
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
[GROANING]
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
[ENTISH GROAN]
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
'YOU!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
[ENTISH GROAN] 3' 8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
PIPPIN:
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
MERRY:
I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
[GRUNTING]
No!
PIPPIN:
Help!
TREEBEARD:
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
GANDALF:
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
ÉOWYN:
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
- Your staff.
- Hm?
Oh...
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
[DOOR LOCKS]
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this Conjurer chooses to appear.
Léthspell I name him.
III news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
[LAUGHS]
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[GROANING]
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
SARUMAN:
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
[YELLING]
[GROANS]
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
[YELLS]
[GROANS]
WORMTONGUE:
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
WORMTONGUE:
Send me not from your sight.
ARAGORN:
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
WORMTONGUE:
Get out of my way!
MAN:
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
[CHANTING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
THÉODEN:
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
GANDALF:
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
[SPEAKING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
ÉOWYN:
Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
THÉODEN:
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
[BURPS]
Then what is the king's decision?
HÁMA:
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI:
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
[ARAGORN SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
[IN ELVISH] Your name is kingly.
[CONTINUES SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
WORMTONGUE:
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
-...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dúnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
SARUMAN:
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found lsildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
WORMTONGUE:
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
[GROWLING]
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM:
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
SMÉAGOL:
No.
Not master.
GOLLUM:
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
SMÉAGOL:
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
SMÉAGOL:
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
[CHUCKLING]
They are YOU'VE]-
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
[SMÉAGOL SHRIEKING]
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
SAM:
Who are they?
SMÉAGOL:
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
[OLIPHAUNT GROANS]
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
[GROANING]
No one at home will believe this.
[BIRD WHISTLES]
Sméagol?
[ARROWS FLYING]
[SCREAMING]
[OLIPHAUNTS TRUMPETING]
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
No!
- Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
- Travelers?
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
GIMLI:
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
[YELLS]
GIMLI:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Númenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
ARWEN:
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
[IN ELVISH] You told me once... this day would come.
[IN ELVISH] This is not the end...it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
[IN ENGLISH] Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
ÉOWYN:
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND:
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
[IN ELVISH] Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
[IN ELVISH] I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war...grief...despair.
[IN ENGLISH] Why are you saying this?
[IN ENGLISH] I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
ÉOWYN:
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
[YELLING AND ROARING]
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLI:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
[WARGS BARKING]
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLI:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
ÉOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLI:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
[SNIFFS]
[GRUNTING]
[YELLS]
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
[LAUGHING]
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... ."dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
[CHOKES]
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
WOMAN 1:
At last!
WOMAN 2:
Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 3:
There it is, Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 4:
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
FREDA:
Mama!
MORWEN:
Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
MAN:
Make way for the king.
GAMLING:
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING:
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
THÉODEN:
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
WORMTONGUE:
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
SARUMAN:
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
SARUMAN:
Tens of thousands.
WORMTONGUE:
But, my lord, there is no such force.
[HORNS SOUNDING]
[ARMY CHEERING]
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
TREEBEARD:
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
ARWEN:
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
ELROND:
Arwen.
[IN ELVISH] It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
[IN ENGLISH] He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
[IN ELVISH] Do I not also have your love?
[IN ELVISH] You have my love, father.
[GALADRIEL SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
GALADRIEL [IN ENGLISH]:
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
[ROARING]
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
FARAMIR:
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
[MEN CHEERING]
MEN:
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
DENETHOR:
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- lsildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
MAN:
Captain Faramir!
[WHISPERING] We found the third one.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool ls nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
[YELLS]
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
[FOOTSTEP]
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
[MUFFLED CRIES]
[GRUNTING AND PANTING]
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
[CRYING]
FARAMIR:
Answer me.
GOLLUM:
Sméagol.
[CRYING]
GOLLUM:
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
SMÉAGOL:
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
GOLLUM:
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
SMÉAGOL:
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
GOLLUM:
Master betrayed us.
SMÉAGOL:
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
GOLLUM:
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
SMÉAGOL:
No.
No.
What did they steal?
GOLLUM:
My precious!
[YELLS]
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Half lings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
[VOICE OF THE RING WHISPERING]
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
SAM:
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
[DISTANT MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
WOMAN:
He's alive!
GIMLI:
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
[IN ELVISH] You're late.
[IN ENGLISH] You look terrible.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[DOORS OPENING]
A great host, you say?
[IN ENGLISH] All lsengard is emptied.
How many?
ARAGORN:
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN:
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon--?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
MAN 1:
We need more time to lay provisions--
THÉODEN:
There is no time.
War is upon us.
MAN 2:
Secure the gate.
[CAWING]
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
[RUMBLING]
TREEBEARD:
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
GUARD 1:
Move back!
Move to the caves!
GUARD 2:
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
[BABY CRYING]
ÉOWYN:
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
[BABY CRYING]
[MUTED SPEECH]
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
[IN ELVISH] And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
[IN ELVISH] They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
Aragorn.
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
[IN ENGLISH] Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLI:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
[ENTS GROANING]
Huh?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
TREEBEARD:
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
GUARD:
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
[IN ELVISH] There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
[HORN BLOWING]
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
GUARD:
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[INDISTINCT GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
GIMLI:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
[THUNDER ROLLS]
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[BABY CRYING]
[IN ELVISH] Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
[ROARS]
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
[U RU K-HAI BATTLE CRIES]
HOLD!
[GROANS]
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
[IN ELVISH] Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
[IN ENGLISH] Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
[IN ENGLISH] I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
[ENTS GROANING]
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
[ARAGORN SHOUTS IN ELVISH]
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
[IN ELVISH] Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH] Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
[ENTS GRUMBLING]
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING:
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
[IN ELVISH] To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
GIMLI:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
[SHOUTING IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make Way!
We cannot hold much longer!
THÉODEN:
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
-I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
MAN 1:
Make way!
MAN 2:
Follow me to the barricade.
MAN 1:
Watch our backs!
MAN 3:
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
MAN 4:
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
GAMLING:
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
Retreat!
ARAGORN:
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
THÉODEN:
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past lsengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
MAN:
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
FRODO:
Faramir!
You must let me go!
TREEBEARD:
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
[GASPS]
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
[ROARING]
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
[GROANING AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Yes.
TREEBEARD:
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
[MUTED SPEECH]
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
ITHILIEN RANGER:
Watch out!
[RUMBLING]
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Nazgûl!
[ROARING]
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
THÉODEN:
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
WOMAN 1:
They're breaking in!
WOMAN 2:
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
GANDALF:
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.

Not alone.

To the king!
Yes!

TREEBEARD:
A hit.
A fine hit.
[TREEBEARD GRUNTS]
TREEBEARD:
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
[RUMBLING]
[ROARING]
[YELLS]
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
[PANTING]
[SWORD CLANGS]
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
SAM'.
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.

Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
[SCREAMING AND YELLING]
Final count...
-...42.
- Forty-two?
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
MERRY:
He doesn't look happy, does he?
PIPPIN:
Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-'mum.
[HOBBITS LAUGHING]
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
SMÉAGOL:
It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
SAM:
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Nice master.
- Nice Hobbits.
SAM:
Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
[RUMBLING]
GANDALF:
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes,
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
FRODO:
Sméagol?
SAM:
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.
SMÉAGOL:
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
SAM:
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
FRODO:
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.

I'm the servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the shadow!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
No!
Gandalf!
What is it Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle Earth we don't want to see any closer.
It's the one place we are trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it Mr. Frodo.
We're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam.
...but they did.
Mr.Frodo?
It's the Ring isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Well, let me see.
Oh yes, lovely
Lembas bread!
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold to foreign food, but this elvish stuff is not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
Those rainclouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
That's because we've been here before!
We are going in circles!
Ah!
What's that 'orrid stink?
I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
Can you smell it?
Yes I can smell it.
We are not alone.
Those thieves!
Those filthy little thieves!
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us
My precious.
Curse them!
We hate them!
We want it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before!
haven't you, Gollum!
Release him or I'll cut your throat!
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes..
Elves twisted it.
Take it off us!
Quiet you!
It's hopeless!
Every Orc in Mordor will hear this racket!
-Let's tie him up and leave him!
-No!
That will kill us, kill us!
It's nothing more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
Now that I've seen him, I do pity him.
We be very nice to hobbits, you be nice to us.
Take it off us!
We swear to do what you wants.
We swear!
There is no promise you make that I can trust.
We swear to serve the master of the precious.
We swear on on the precious.
Gollum, Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the preciouss.
I don't believe you!
Get down!
-Get down!
-Sam!
He was trying to trick us!
We let him go he'll throttle us into our sleep!
-Do you know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail!
Let's go!
Their pace quickens.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on Gimli!
Three day's and night's pursuit.
No food... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare Rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us, come!
Come Gimli!
We are gaining on them.
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous we are over short distances.
Rohan, home of the horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets it's will against us.
Legolas!
What does your elf eyes see?
The Orcs turn Northeast.
They are taking the hobbits to Isengard!
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard ...and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, My Lord Sauron, ...we shall rule this Middle-Earth.
The old world will burn in the fires of industry.
Forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machinery of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the Orcs.
We now have only to remove those who oppose us.
The horsemen have taken your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of Rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in the Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
Take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
But Papa says Eothain must not ride.
He's too big for him!
Listen to me!
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm
-Do you understand me?
-Yes mum!
I don't wanna go!
I don't wanna go, mama!
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child!
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred!
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie!
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima?
Grima?
Grima?
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked, unchallenged, killing at will.
Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is weary of your malcontent.
...your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long has it been since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing, that's the key!
Breathe!
Ho!
They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We ain't goin' no further till we've had a breather.
Get the fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think, we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest?
On the borders of Buckland?
Folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
What about them?
They're flesh!
They are not for eating!
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
Ooh!
They look tasty!
Get back!
Just a mouthful?
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!
Pippin!
Let's go!
Go on, call for help.
Squeal!
No one's gonna save you now!
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan!
What news from the Mark?
What business does an elf, a man, and a dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell!
I'm Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas from the Woodland realm
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your King.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this land.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there they say as an old man.
Hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
We are not spies.
We track a band of Uruk-Hai westward across the plains.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Do you see two Hobbits with them?
They will be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
They are dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters.
Farewel.
Look for your friends, but do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their little belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here and the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here and were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into...
Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drew them there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm gonna rip off both your little heads!
Come here!
Trees!
Climb a tree!
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot-hole in your belly.
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs!
It's talking Merry.The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
Treeherder!
Shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it Merry.
Don't encourage it.
Treebeard some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side.... ...because nobody is on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore..
We are not Orcs.
We are Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire they come with axes.
Biting, breaking, hacking, burning.
Destroyers and usurpers.
Curse them!
No!
You don't understand.
We are Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shirefolk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
White Wizard?
Saruman!
See, see!
We have led you out!
Hurry, hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice hobbit.
It's a bog!
He's led us into a swamp!
Swamp, yes, yes!
Come master.
We will take you to safe paths, through the mist.
Come Hobbits, come.
We move quickly!
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it
They go round for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Swift and quickly like shadows must be..
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water!
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and men and Orcs.
A great battle long ago.
The Dead Marshes.
Yes, yes!
That is the name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights!
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you alright?
So bright, so beautiful.
Ah precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master need to keep up his strength.
Who are you?
Musn't ask us it's name not his business.
Gollum, Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
Cold be heart and Rock and bone.
And call every traveller far from home.
He said your life was was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead when sun has faded and moon is dead.
You were not so different from a Hobbit once were you...
Smeagol?
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name..
My name
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on Frodo, Come on!
They will see us!
They will see us
- I thought they were dead!
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's alright.
I'm here.
Hurry, hobbits!
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood!
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memories and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your axe.
Aragorn, something is out there!
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will out a spell on us!
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be!
You fell!
Through fire.... ...and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought him, the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me.... ...and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and each day was as long as a life age of the earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf!
Gandalf?
Oh yes.
That's what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf!
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of the journey is over, another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax
He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
My home.
I sleep in the forest here.
The roots of the mountains.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have gone wild and dangerous.
Anger is in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us that are left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
My old Gaffer have a thing or two to say if he sees this now.
Master says show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does what master says so.
I did.
We cannot get past them.
Look!
The gate, it's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam!
No!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there.
Now!
No!
No!
No master!
They catch you!
They catch you.
Don't take it to Him.
He wants the precious.
Always he's looking for it!
And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him.
But we musn't let him have it.
No!
There is another way.
More secret, and dark way.
Why haven't you spoke of this before?
Because master did not ask!
He is up to something.
Are you saying that there is another way to Mordor?
Yes.
There is a path and some stairs .
And then a tunnel.
He has led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no!
He's been true to his word.
No!
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld
There dwelts Theoden, King of Rohan ...whose mind is overthrown... and Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son is dead
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
He must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand his passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, you snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
The bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you..
So fair.
So cold.
like a morning pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
This place is as cheerful as a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden-king so armed, Gandalf Grayhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
Oh.
No, you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
My Lord.
Gandalf the Grey is coming.
A herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden-King.
He is not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf, Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question my lord.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be Silence!
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
Your staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff!
Theoden Son of Thengel too long have you sat in shadows.
I would stay still if I were you!
I will release you from the spell.
You have no powers here Gandalf the Grey
I'll draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine!
Be gone!
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn!
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark my dreams have been of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only..
...ever served you my lord.
Your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your side!
No my Lord!
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden, King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
At last, that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirits will find his way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the wildmen are moving through westfold.
Burning as they go..
..every rick and cot.
Where's momma?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from the women and children.
You must fight!
You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be three hundred leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what is that you want of me.
But I would not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep!
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He is only doing what he thinks is best for his people
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that of ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he is leading them to safety.
But what he'll get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong hold but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end there, Aragorn
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That is what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of men have walked this earth and now, I have no time.
Good luck.
My search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming.
At first light of the fifth day at dawn, look to the East.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You are a daughter of kings.
A shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that will be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It is vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
It will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your warg riders.
Hey Stinker!
Don't go getting too far ahead!
Why do you do that?
- What?
- Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
'Cause that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him.
What is still doing to him.
I want to help him Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he could come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taking a hold of you Mr Frodo.
You have to fight it.
I know what I have to do Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me
It's my task!
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We want it.
We need it.
Must have the Precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little hobbitses.
Wicked, tricky, filth!
No!
No!
Master.
Yes.
Precious first.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
Not listening.
You're a liar, and a thief.
No.
Murderer!
Go away!
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum!
Gollum!
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No!
Leave now and never come back!
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away!
And away he goes, Precious.
Gone, gone, gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look!
Look!
See what Smeagol finds!
They are young!
They are tender and nice.
Yes they are!
Eat them.
Eat them!
Make him sick you will behaving like that
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's he doing!
Stupid fat hobbit!
You ruin it!
Whats to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need it a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Po-ta-toes!
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh yes, we could.
Spoiling nice fish!
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips!
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
It will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make His war
The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
We've got to keep moving.
Come on Sam.
Mr. Frodo!
Look!
It's an Oliphant!
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here for too long.
Come on Sam!
Ah!
Bind their hands.
It's true you don't see many dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... ..they are often mistaken for dwarf men.
It's the beards.
And this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no dwarf women.
And the dwarves just, spring out of holes in the ground!
Which is of course ridiculous.
It's alright!
It's alright!
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am alseep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once this day would come.
This is not the end.
It is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen.
If you trust nothing else trust this trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel?
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the West.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands there to be ever green.
But never more than a memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
You have a chance for another life away from war, grief ...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I'm mortal.
You are elfkind.
It was a dream Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Wargs!
We are under attack!
All riders to the head of the column!
Come on, get me up here.
I'm a rider!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep and make haste.
- I can fight!
- No!
You must do this.
For me.
Follow me!
Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my axe!
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature!
Aragorn!
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing
He's dead....
He took a little thumble off the cliff.
You lie!
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolfs of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
Finally!
Helm's deep!
There it is, Helm's deep!
We're saved, my lady!
Thank you!
Momma!
Freda!
Make way for the king!
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate and set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has but one weakness.
It's outer wall is solid Rock for for a small culvert in space which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device can break down a wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
It's victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look!
The smoke to the south!
There is always smoke rising up from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now, he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army!
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now before it is too late.
I've made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hoped for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality ...
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time .... ... Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you.
No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death.
An image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory, undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt ...
As night falling winter has come without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to you grief, under the fading trees until all the world has changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ringbearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand.
The quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand to take the Ring for his own and the world will fall.
He is close now.
So close to achieving his goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even until the ending of the world.
The time of the elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-Earth to this fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshalling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.
How many?
Some thousands.
More come every day.
Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled five hundred men out of Osgiliath.
But if the city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies!
Now wait just a minute!
Well if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak!
We are hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favoured look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria.
Two were my kin.
A dwarf there was also.
And an elf.
And two men Aragorn, son of Arathorn and Boromir of Gondor.
You were friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It would grieve you then to learn that he is dead?
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I had hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found it.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall they shoot?
Rock and pool is nice and cool.
So juicy sweet.
..to catch a fish!
So juicy sweet!
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol!
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol!
Trust master.
Come!
We must... go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me, come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle!
Smeagol listen to me!
Master!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me!
Smeagol?
Why do you cry, Smeagol?
Cruel men hurt us.
Master tricked us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricky.
I told you he was false.
- Master is our friend...
- Our friend?
Master betrayed us!
No, not it's business.
Leave us alone.
Filthy little hobbits!
They stole it from us!
No... no.
What did they steal?
My Precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me, but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on He'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo ...
So... this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the wild I have you.
Two haflings and a host of men at my call.
And the Ring of power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone!
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going.
Into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire.
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Capitain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he?
Get out of my way!
I'm gonna kill him!
You are the luckiest, the cunningest and most reckless man I ever knew!
Bless you, laddie!
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten-thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
to destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come.
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the deeping wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs!
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on Rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We're seen it before.
Crops can be resown.
Homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages!
They come to destroy its people down to the last child!
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance!
Send out riders, my lord
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
Where was Gon ... ?
No, my lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord.
- There is no time.
War is upon us!
Secure the gate.
The ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time.
But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Ent moot.
What's that?
It is a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech, Oak, Chestnut, Ash.
Good, good, good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if we Ents will go to war.
Move to the cave!
Quickly now!
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be.
Three hundred against ten thousand.
They have a better chance defending themselves here than in Edoras.
Aragorn...
They cannot win this fight!
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, Sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the west behind the hills into shadow.
How did it come to this?
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword Haleth, son of Hama.
There is always hope.
We have trusted you this far and you have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
If we had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn!
Send for the king.
Open the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honour that allegiance.
You are most welcome!
We are proud to fight along side men, once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well lad, the luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy!
For you shall receive none!
-What's happening out there?
-Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
Hold!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck and under the arms.
Release Arrows!
Anybody hit anything?
Give them a volley.
Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
- Legolas, two already!
- I'm on seventeen!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help!
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War, yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in old entish.
And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
Twenty.
Twenty one.
Twenty two.
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman.
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gates!
Hold them!
Stand fast!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this war.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
This is not our war.
But your part of this world!
Aren't you?
You must help.
Please!
You must do something.
You are young and brave, master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We're got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckburough and Buckland will burn.
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Pull back to the keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
To the gate!
Draw your swords!
We can't hold much longer.
Hold them!
How long do you need?
As long as you can give me!
Gimli!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them!
It's a long way,
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance.
Toss me!
Don't tell the elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back!
Pull them back!
Pull back!
They are broken through!
The castle is free!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Hurry!
Get them inside!
Come, to the keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south!
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly
If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad, we'll be caught!
No we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns.
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please ...
Let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and it tickles me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere.
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in elvish entish or the tongues of men for this treachery!
My business is with Isengard tonight.
With a rock and stone.
Yes!
Come my friends!
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our dooml
The last march of the ents.
Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we'll be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be alright.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
You wanna know what happened to Boromir?
You wanna know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo!
After swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They're come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it!
They're breaking in!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
And barricade the entrance!
So much death.
What can men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory?
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the East.
Yes.
Yes!
The Horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and the red dawn!
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden-King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin, hold on!
Hold on, little hobbits!
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened.
Victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you.
That meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going.
Because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country.
The laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes, that's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy ..."
"the most famousest of hobbits.
And that's saying alot."
You left out one of the chief characters.
Samwise the Brave.
I want to hear more about Sam.
"Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam."
Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
'Samwise the Brave.'
Smeagol?
We're not gonna wait for you.
Come on!
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise!
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us!
Wicked, tricky, filth!
We ought to ring his filthy little neck!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
Then we take the Precious and we be the master!
But the fat hobbit.
He knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out!
Put out his eyes.
And make him crawl.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Kill them both.
Yes!
No.
No!
It's too risky, it's too risky!
Where're he gone?
- Gollum, where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, Precious, she could!
And then we take it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Hush!
Come on, hobbits.
Long ways to go yet!
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!
i am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandaif meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
... buttheydid.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food...
... butthisElvishstuff,it's notbad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
... haven'tyou,Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears...
... toservethemaster of the precious.
We will swear on...
... ontheprecious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
We will hold you to your word.
Yes...
... ontheprecious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
-Get down!
I said, down!
-Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world Is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...
... andMordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...
... andtheunionofthetwotowers?
Together, my Lord Sauron...
... weshallrulethis Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
... andtheironfistsofthe Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord...
... Isreadyto fall.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...
... yourwarmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...
... underpainofdeath.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further...
... untilwe 'vehadabreather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
... andcomealive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper...
... talktoeachother...
... evenmove.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!
-Carve them up!
-Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan...
... whatnewsfromthe Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...
... ifitstoodbut alittlehigher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...
... andclaimedlordshipovertheselands .
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say...
... asanoldman hoodedandcloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle...
... intoFangornForest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side...
... becausenobody'son my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
-Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
-No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are...
... andmaybeyouaren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
... andlightlittlecandles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
-I thought they were dead.
-Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
... andanger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire...
... andwater.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
... I foughtwiththe Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy...
... andsmotehis ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me...
... andistrayedoutofthought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead...
... andeveryday was aslong as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back...
... untilmy taskisdone .
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And i come back to you now...
... attheturnofthetide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas...
... unlessmy eyesare cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses...
... andhasbeenmyfriend through many dangers.
My home lies deep in the forest...
... neartherootsofthemountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
-I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
-Now!
-No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path...
... andsomestairs.
And then...
... atunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...
... whosemindisoverthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son...
... heis dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king...
... tolosehisonlysonandheir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
... inthebitterwatchesofthenight...
... whenallyourlifeseemstoshrink .
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring...
... stillclingingto winter'schill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
... ThéodenKing.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
... GandalfStormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour...
... inwhichthisconjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death...
... tobandycrookedwords with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden...
... sonofThengel...
... toolonghaveyou sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you...
... fromthespell.
You have no power here...
... GandalftheGrey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me...
... youwillnotkillhim.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
... iftheygraspedyoursword.
I've only...
... everservedyou,mylord .
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live...
... toseethelastdays ofmy house .
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me...
... butI willnotbringfurtherdeath to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
... Théoden,notAragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king...
... thecitymustempty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings...
... ashieldmaidenof Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep...
... thegreatfortressofRohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
-Why do you do that?
-What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him...
... whatit'sstilldoingtohim.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
-You have to fight it.
-I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now...
... andnevercomeback.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will...
... behavinglikethat.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw...
... andwriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance...
... thatthey'reoftenmistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...
... thattherearenoDwarfwomen ...
... andthatDwarvesjustspringout of holes in the ground...
... whichis,of course,ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom i will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once...
this day would come.
This is not the end... itisthebeginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen... .
If you trust nothing else...
trust this...
... trustus.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
You have a chance for another life...
away from war... grief...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
-Háma?
-I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
-What is it?
What do you see?
-Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
-I can fight.
-No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
-Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!
-That's it!
Go on!
-Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's...
... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
-Mama!
-Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn...
... whereishe ?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock...
... butforasmallculvert at its base...
... whichis littlemorethan adrain .
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning...
... thousands,tostormthe Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night...
... thelandwillbestained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising...
... fromIsengardthesedays.
Isengard?
There was a time...
... whenSarumanwouldwalkinmy woods .
But now he has a mind of metal...
... andwheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... beforeitis toolate.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...
... andallthatyou hopefor comes true...
... youwillstillhavetotaste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
... Aragornwilldie.
And there will be no comfort for you...
... nocomforttoease thepain of his passing.
He will come to death...
... animageofthesplendor of the kings of Men...
... ingloryundimmedbefore the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter...
... youwilllingeronindarkness and in doubt...
... asnightfallinwinter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell...
... boundto yourgrief under the fading trees...
... untilallthe worldischanged...
... andthelongyearsofyourlife are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here...
... onlydeath.
Do i not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...
... todestroythe peopleofRohan .
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...
... thelastfreekingdomofMen .
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
in his heart, Frodo begins to understand...
... thequestwillclaimhislife.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
it is the risk we all took.
in the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
it works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...
... taketheRingforhisown, and the world will fall.
it is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth...
... evenuntototheending of the world.
The time of the Elves...
... isover.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
-How many?
-Some thousands.
More come every day.
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
if their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria...
... twoweremy kin...
... aDwarftherewas also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
it will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, i'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall i shoot?
The rock and pool is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And i to him.
He is our guide.
Please...
... letmego downtohim.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
i told you he was tricksy.
i told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
i can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but... .
i'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
if i put it on...
... he'llfindme.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo... .
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild i have you...
... twoHalflings...
... anda hostof menatmycall.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...
... toshowhisquality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please. it's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
-He's alive!
-Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
i'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest...
... andthemostrecklessman i ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
-All isengard is emptied.
-How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
it is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...
... tobereadyfor battlebynightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...
... orsetfootinsidetheHornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
i have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
i know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown...
... homesrebuilt.
Within these walls...
... wewilloutlastthem.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people...
... downtothelastchild.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
if this is to be our end, then i would have them make such an end...
... astobe worthyofremembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon--?
No, my Lord Aragorn...
... wearealone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions--
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled...
... aboutthewarsofMenandwizards...
... fora verylongtime.
But now, something is about to happen...
... thathasnothappened...
... foranage.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents...
... willgoto war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
-Keep moving.
-Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred...
against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then i shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am i , Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord...
... willfollowyoutowhateverend.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West...
... behindthehills...
... intoShadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma...
... thereisalwayshope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
i was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, i'd get this adjusted.
it's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
i bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy...
for you shall receive none!
-What's happening out there?
-Shall i describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck...
and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
-Fire!
-Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
i'm on 1 7!
i'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
i have told your names to the Entmoot...
... andwehaveagreed...
... youarenotOrcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
it affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit...
... ittakesalongtime ...
... tosayanythinginOldEntish...
... andweneversay anything...
... unlessit is worthtaking...
... alongtimetosay.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
is this it?
is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
it's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of isengard will spread...
... andthewoodsofTuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And... .
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
it's a long way.
Toss me.
-What?
-i cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
-Fall back!
-Retreat!
Hurry!
i nside.
Get them inside!
into the Keep!
i will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
-Turn around.
Take us south.
-South?
But that will lead you past isengard.
Yes.
Exactiy.
if we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
it's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then...
... youareverysmall.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
i always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
it has only the power to destroy.
Please...
... letmego .
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice...
... thatclimbup sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they... .
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures i had known from nut and acorn.
i'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
... Entishor thetonguesofMen...
... forthistreachery.
My business is with isengard tonight...
... withrockandstone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
it is likely...
... thatwego to ourdoom.
Last march...
... oftheEnts.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
it's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
it is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
is there no other way?
There is one passage.
it leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the pass.
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn...
... lookto theeast.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...
... shallsoundin theDeep...
... onelasttime.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath...
... nowforruinanda red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
it's me.
it's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
i can't do this, Sam.
i know.
it's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
it's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...
... becausehowcouldthe end behappy?
How could the world go back to the way it was...
... whenso muchbad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing...
... thisshadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you...
... thatmeantsomething.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But i think, Mr. Frodo, i do understand.
i know now.
Folk in those stories...
... hadlotsofchancesofturningback, only they didn't.
They kept going...
... becausetheywereholding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
i think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
if you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...
... somewherein thewilderness.
i wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
i wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
i want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
i was being serious.
So was i .
"Samwise the Brave. "
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious...
... andwebe themaster!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
it's too risky. it's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
-Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
-Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-Lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the Iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
We cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord Is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
And we are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has falled and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But It was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- ...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is ithe West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dùr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nùmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden Is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- ...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dùnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Out down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dùnedain.
A descendant of Nùmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end...it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war...grief...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.

Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
[YELLS]
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
SAM:
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
[RUMBLING]
[GASPING]
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
[THUNDER ROLLING]
SAM:
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
SAM:
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
[WHEEZING]
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
SMEAGOL:
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
GOLLUM:
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
SMEAGOt This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
PIPPIN:
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Ore-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
[LAUGHING]
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Huh?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
[RUMBLING]
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lérien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
ARAGORN:
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
ARAGORN:
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
LEGOLAS:
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
SARUMAN".
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
[YELLING AND SQUEALING]
SARUMAN".
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
SARUMAN:
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
ORC:
But, my lord, there are too many!
We cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a darn, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
WILD MAN:
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
SARUMAN:
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
SARUMAN:
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
[YELLING]
SARUMAN".
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
FREDA:
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.

My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théod red.
EOWYN:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THEODEN:
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
[GRUNTING]
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
[YELLS]
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
ORC 1:
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[GROANING]
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other...
"EVER move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
LEADER:
Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.

Blood has been spilled this night.
[HOOVES BEATING]
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would out off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gléin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
[WHISTLES]
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.

Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[YELLS]
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
MERRY:

Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?

Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
[HOBBITS GROANING]
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Half lings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.

Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!

He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes-
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
And we are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
GOLLUM:
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
[COUGHS]
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
SAM:
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
GOLLUM:
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.

FRODO:

Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.

Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
[TREES GROANING]
The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN:
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
[IN ELVISH] Something's out there.
[IN ELVISH] What do you see?
[IN ENGLISH] The White Wizard approaches.
[IN ENGLISH] Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
WHITE WIZARD:
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD:
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Ba/rog of Morgoth.
[ROARING AND YELLING]
GANDALF".
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
GIMLI:
Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested--?
[TREES GROANING]
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
-...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
[WHISTLING]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GAN DALF:
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD:
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Oh.
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dﬂr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of NUmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
SMEAGOt The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
SMEAGOL:
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
[HORNS BLOWING]
[ROARS]
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
SMEAGOL:
No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
[RUMBLING]
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
PIPPIN:
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
[GROANING]
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
[ENTISH GROAN]
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
'Who?
'YOu!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
[ENTISH GROAN] 3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
PIPPIN:
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
MERRY:
I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
[GRUNTING]
No!
PIPPIN:
Help!
TREEBEARD:
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
GANDALF:
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
EOWYN:
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
- Your staff.
- Hm?
Oh...
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
[DOOR LOCKS]
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Léthspell I name him.
I'll news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the Wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
RAUGHS]
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[GROANING]
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
SARUMAN:
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
[YELLING]
[GROANS]
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
[YELLS]
[GROANS]
WORMTONGUE:
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
WORMTONGUE:
Send me not from your sight.
ARAGORN:
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
WORMTONGUE:
Get out of my way!
MAN:
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théod red?
Where is my son?
[CHANTING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
THEODEN:
Simbelmyné.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
GANDALF:
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
[SPEAKING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
EOWYN:
Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
THEODEN:
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
[BURPS]
Then what is the king's decision?
HAMA:
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI:
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They Will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
[ARAGORN SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
[IN ELVISH] Your name is kingly.
[CONTINUES SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
WORMTONGUE:
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
-...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
SARUMAN:
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found lsildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
WORMTONGUE:
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
[GROWLING]
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM:
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
SMEAGOt No.
Not master.
GOLLUM:
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
SMEAGOt Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
SMEAGOt Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
[CHUCKLING]
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
[SMEAGOL SHRIEKING]
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling-
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
SAM:
Who are they?
SMEAGOL:
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
[OLIPHAUNT GROANS]
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
[GROANING]
No one at home will believe this.
[BIRD WHISTLES]
Sméagol?
[ARROWS FLYING]
[SCREAMING]
[OLIPHAUNTS TRUMPETING]
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
No!
- Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
- Travelers?
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
GIMLI:
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
[YELLS]
GIMLI:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
-It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the dunedain.
A descendant of NUmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
ARWEN:
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
[IN ELVISH] You told me once... this day would come.
[IN ELVISH] This is not the end...it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
[IN ENGLISH] Arvven...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust HS.
EOWYN:
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND'.
Our time here is ending.
Arm/en's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
[IN ELVISH] Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
[IN ELVISH] I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war...grief...despair.
[IN ENGLISH] Why are you saying this?
[IN ENGLISH] I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arvven.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
EOWYN:
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What is it?
- Héma?
- I'm not sure.
[YELLING AND ROARING]
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLI:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
[WARGS BARKING]
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLI:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
EOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLI:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
[SNIFFS]
[GRUNTING]
[YELLS]
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
[LAUGHING]
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... ."dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
[CHOKES]
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
WOMAN 1:
At last!
WOMAN 2:
Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 3:
There it is, Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 4:
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
FREDA:
Mama!
MORWEN:
Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
MAN:
Make way for the king.
GAMLING:
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING:
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
THEODEN:
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
WORMTONGUE".
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
SARUMAN:
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
SARUMAN:
Tens of thousands.
WORMTONGUE:
But, my lord, there is no such force.
[HORNS SOUNDING]
[ARMY CHEERING]
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
TREEBEARD:
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
ARWEN:
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
ELROND:
Arvven.
[IN ELVISH] It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
[IN ENGLISH] He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arvven.
There is nothing for you here only death.
[IN ELVISH] Do I not also have your love?
[IN ELVISH] You have my love, father.
[GALADRIEL SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
GALADRIEL [IN ENGLISH]:
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
[ROARING]
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
FARAMIR:
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gang rel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How'?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
[MEN CHEERING]
MEN:
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
DENETHOR:
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
-lsildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
-...send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
MAN:
Captain Faramir!
[WHISPERING] We found the third one.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool ls nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
[YELLS]
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
[FOOTSTEP]
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
[MUFFLED CRIES]
[GRUNTING AND PANTING]
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
[CRYING]
FARAMIR:
Answer me.
GOLLUM:
Sméagol.
[CRYING]
GOLLUM:
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
SMEAGOt Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
GOLLUM:
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
SMEAGOt Master is our friend.
Our friend.
GOLLUM:
Master betrayed us.
SMEAGOt No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
GOLLUM:
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
SMEAGOt No.
No.
What did they steal?
GOLLUM:
My precious!
[YELLS]
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Half lings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
[VOICE OF THE RING WHISPERING]
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
SAM:
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
[DISTANT MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
WOMAN:
He's alive!
GIMLI:
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
[IN ELVISH] You're late.
[IN ENGLISH] You look terrible.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[DOORS OPENING]
A great host, you say?
[IN ENGLISH] All lsengard is emptied.
How many?
ARAGORN:
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN:
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gen-l?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
MAN 1:
We need more time to lay provisions--
THEODEN:
There is no time.
War is upon us.
MAN 2:
Secure the gate.
[CAWING]
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
[RUMBLING]
TREEBEARD:
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
GUARD 1:
Move back!
Move to the caves!
GUARD 2:
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
[BABY CRYING]
EOWYN:
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
[BABY CRYING]
[MUTED SPEECH]
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
[IN ELVISH] And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
[IN ELVISH] They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
Aragorn.
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
[IN ENGLISH] Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLI:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
[ENTS GROANING]
Huh?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
TREEBEARD:
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
GUARD:
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Héma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Héma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
[IN ELVISH] There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
[HORN BLOWING]
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
GUARD:
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[INDISTINCT GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
GIMLI:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
[THUNDER ROLLS]
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[BABY CRYING]
[IN ELVISH] Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
[ROARS]
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
[U RU K-HAI BATTLE CRIES]
HOLD!
[GROANS]
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
[IN ELVISH] Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
[IN ENGLISH] Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
[IN ENGLISH] I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
[ENTS GROANING]
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War'?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
[ARAGORN SHOUTS IN ELVISH]
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
[IN ELVISH] Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH] Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
[ENTS GRUMBLING]
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING:
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
[IN ELVISH] To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
GIMLI:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
[SHOUTING IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
THEODEN:
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
-I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
MAN 1:
Make way!
MAN 2:
Follow me to the barricade.
MAN 1:
Watch our backs!
MAN 3:
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
MAN 4:
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
THEODEN:
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
GAMLING:
Fall back!
THEODEN:
Retreat!
ARAGORN:
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
THEODEN:
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past lsengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
MAN:
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
FRODO:
Faramir!
You must let me go!
TREEBEARD:
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
[GASPS]
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
[ROARING]
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
[GROANING AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Yes.
TREEBEARD:
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
N is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
[MUTED SPEECH]
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Ithilien RANGER:
Watch out!
[RUMBLING]
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Nazgou
[ROARING]
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
THEODEN:
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
WOMAN 1:
They're breaking in!
WOMAN 2:
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride outwith me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
GANDALF".
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
[HORN BLOWS]
Forth Eorlingas!
[BATTLE CRIES]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
[GRUNTS]
[ENTS ROARING]
TREEBEARD:
A hit.
A fine hit.
[TREEBEARD GRUNTS]
TREEBEARD:
Break the darn!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
[RUMBLING]
[ROARING]
[YELLS]
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
[PANTING]
[SWORD CLANGS]
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
SAM:
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going--- ...because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
[HOOVES BEATING]
EOMER:
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
[SCREAMING AND YELLING]
Final count...
-...42.
- Forty-two?
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
MERRY:
He doesn't look happy, does he?
PIPPIN:
Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
[HOBBITS LAUGHING]
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
SMEAGOL: n is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
SAM:
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Nice master.
- Nice Hobbits.
SAM:
Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
[RUMBLING]
GANDALF:
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my b0)'-
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
FRODO:
Sméagol?
SAM:
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.
SMEAGOt Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
SAM:
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
FRODO:
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war... grief... despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quicky, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
South Farthing
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
Ripped and Fixed By evgeni99
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You - shall not - pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
The Two Towers
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't wanna see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the black gate.
To the gate, to the gate!
To the gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the great eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late, our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The old world will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Èothain!
Èothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Èothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Èomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Èomer, son of Èomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden...your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace after death.)
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs
- Búrarum.
It's talking, Merry, the tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go 'round for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes a hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
...Tangado haid!
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees...teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Aragorn, nad no ennas!
(Aragorn, something is out there!
)
Man cenich?
(What do you see?
)
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over, another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
"O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head how golden-red
The crown you bore aloft."
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Búrarum.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
"Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best."
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Númenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
3 foot, 6"?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
3 foot 8"?
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Búrarum.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent!
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Théngel too long have you sat in the shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Harken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Èowyn.
Èowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
"Bealocwealm...
("An evil death...) ...hafað fréone frecan forth onsended...
(...has set forth the noble warrior...) ...giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende." (...
A song shall sing sorrowing minstrels.")
"On Meduselde þæt he ma no wære...
("In Meduseld that he is no more...) ...is þurh niedig rest." (...for his necessary rest.")
"And mægen deorost...
(And that he is the dearest kinsman...) ...bealo..." (...killing took him...")
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
"Westu hái." ("Be thou well.")
"Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu." ("Go thou, Théodred, go thou.)
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent, for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Èomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Èomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
Brego!
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
- Fæste ... stille nú.
(
- Fast ... quiet now.)
Fæste ... stille nú.
(Fast ... quiet now.)
Stille ... stille ... stille.
(Quiet ... quiet ... quiet.)
Lac is drefed, gefrægon.
(A battle is stirred up, they heard.)
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?
)
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego?
Ðin nama is cynglic.
(Your name is kingly.)
Man le trasta, Brego?
(What troubles you, Brego?
)
Man cenich?
(What did you see?
)
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dúnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor
- He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
"Those without swords can still die upon them."
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg Riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look, see what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters
- Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an Oliphant.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and the Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right, it's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl, when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
And she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
Oh No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Théngel, my grandfather
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
70?
But you cannot be 80!
?
87.
You are one of the Dúnedain.
A descendant of Númenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Minlû pedich nin...
(You told me once...) ...i aur hen telitha.

(You cannot falter now.)
Arwen...

(If you trust nothing else...) ...estelio han...
(...trust this...)
Estelio ammen.
(Trust us.)
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.

(Is this how you leave?
)

(...away from war...grief, despair.)
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king!
Make way for Théoden!
Make way for the king!
So few...so few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate and set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
Tollen i lû.
(It is time.)
I chair gwannar na Valannor.
(The ships are leaving for Valinor.)
Si bado, no círar.
Go now...before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
A im ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(Do I not also have your love?
)
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.
(You have my love, father.)
I amar prestar aen.
(The world is changed.)
Han mathon ne nen.
(I feel it in the water.)
Han mathon ne chae, (I feel it in the earth,) a han noston ned 'wilith.
(and I smell it in the air.)
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free Kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also and an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed.
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
Well done men...
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, Wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you!
...
You are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend.)
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm gonna kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
Le abdollen.
(You're late.)
You look terrible.
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)
A great host, you say
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the deeping wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Boe a hyn (And they should be)
Neled herain...dan caer menig (300...against 10,000!
)
Si beriathar hyn (They have more hope of...) ammaeg na ned Edoras.
(...defending themselves here than at Edoras...)
Aragorn nedin dagor hen ú-'erir ortheri.
(Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.)
Natha daged dhaer.
(They are all going to die!
)
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas.
(There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
Mae govannen, Haldir!
(Well met, Haldir!
)
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn...
(Show them no mercy...) ...an uben tanatha le faelas.
(...for you shall receive none!
)
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
Dartho!
(Hold!
)
So it begins.
Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!
)
Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!
)
Faeg i-varv...
Their armour is weak at the neck dîn na lanc a nu ranc.
(...and beneath the arm.)
Leithio i philinn!
(Fire the arrows!
)
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Tengado chadad!
(Keep firing!
)
Send them to me!
Come on!
Pendraith!
(Ladders!
)
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
19!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
17!
18!
19!
20!
21!
22 and 23!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Togo han dad, Legolas!
(Bring him down, Legolas!
)
Dago hon!
(Kill him!
)
Dago hon!
(Kill him!
)
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Hado i philinn!
(Hurl the arrows!
)
Herio!
(Charge!
)
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Am Marad!
(To the Keep!
)
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
Haldir!
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!
)
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
- Yes.
- Rárum-rum!
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
The Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Èomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end ...because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in the South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say;
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.

- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested-?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- ... and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- ... was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- ... send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Smeagol.
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon-?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions-
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- ... 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave. "
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested-?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- ... and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- ... was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- ... send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Smeagol.
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon-?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions-
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- ... 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave. "
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret fire.
wIelder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you.
flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
... buttheydid.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food...
... butthisElvishstuff,it's notbad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
... haven'tyou,Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears...
... toservethemaster of the precious.
We will swear on...
... ontheprecious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes...
... ontheprecious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
-Get down!
I said, down!
-Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world Is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...
... andMordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...
... andtheunionofthetwotowers?
Together. my Lord Sauron...
... weshallrulethis MIddle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
... andtheIronfistsofthe Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan. my lord...
... Isreadyto fall.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...
... yourwarmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...
... underpainofdeath.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further...
... untilwe 'vehadabreather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
... andcomealive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper...
... talktoeachother...
... evenmove.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!
-Carve them up!
-Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan...
... whatnewsfromthe Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...
... ifitstoodbut alittlehigher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...
... andclaimedlordshipovertheselands .
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say...
... asanoldman hoodedandcloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle...
... intoFangornForest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side...
... becausenobody'son my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
-Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
-No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are...
... andmaybeyouaren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it. I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
... andlightlittlecandles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon Is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
-l thought they were dead.
-Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
... andanger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire...
... andwater.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
... I foughtwiththe Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy...
... andsmotehis ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me...
... andIstrayedoutofthought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead...
... andeveryday was aslong as a life age of the Earth.
But It was not the end.
I felt life In me again.
I've been sent back...
... untilmy taskisdone .
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now...
... attheturnofthetide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas...
... unlessmy eyesare cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses...
... andhasbeenmyfriend through many dangers.
My home lies deep In the forest...
... neartherootsofthemountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where l'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
-l do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-l know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
-Now!
-No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path...
... andsomestairs.
And then...
... atunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...
... whosemindIsoverthrown.
Saruman 's hold over king Théoden Is now very strong.
My lord, your son...
... heis dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king...
... tolosehisonlysonandheir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
... inthebitterwatchesofthenight...
... whenallyourlifeseemstoshrink .
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring...
... stillclingingto winter'schill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
... ThéodenKing.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
... GandalfStormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour...
... inwhichthisconjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
iii news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death...
... tobandycrookedwords with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden...
... sonofThengel...
... toolonghaveyou sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you...
... fromthespell.
You have no power here...
... GandalftheGrey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me...
... youwillnotkillhim.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
... iftheygraspedyoursword.
I've only...
... everservedyou,mylord .
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyn.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live...
... toseethelastdays ofmy house .
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me...
... butI willnotbringfurtherdeath to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
... Théoden,notAragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king...
... thecitymustempty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings...
... ashieldmaidenof Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep...
... thegreatfortressofRohan.
It Is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
-Why do you do that?
-What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him...
... whatit'sstilldoingtohim.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
-You have to fight it.
-l know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening. I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now...
... andnevercomeback.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will...
... behavinglikethat.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw...
... andwriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance...
... thatthey'reoftenmistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...
... thattherearenoDwarfwomen ...
... andthatDwarvesjustspringout of holes in the ground...
... whichis,of course,ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It Is mine to give to whom I will.
LIke my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once...
this day would come.
This is not the end... itisthebeginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen... .
If you trust nothing else...
trust this...
... trustus.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here Is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
You have a chance for another life...
away from war... grief...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
-Háma?
-l'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
-What is it?
What do you see?
-Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here. I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
-l can fight.
-No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
-Forward. I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!
-That's it!
Go on!
-Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's...
... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
-Mama!
-Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn...
... whereishe ?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall Is solid rock...
... butforasmallculvert at Its base...
... whichIs littlemorethan adrain .
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning...
... thousands,tostormthe Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night...
... thelandwillbestained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising...
... fromIsengardthesedays.
Isengard?
There was a time...
... whenSarumanwouldwalkinmy woods .
But now he has a mind of metal...
... andwheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... beforeitis toolate.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...
... andallthatyou hopefor comes true...
... youwillstillhavetotaste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
... Aragornwilldie.
And there will be no comfort for you...
... nocomforttoease thepain of his passing.
He will come to death...
... anImageofthesplendor of the kings of Men...
... Ingloryundimmedbefore the breaking of the world.
But you. my daughter...
... youwilllingeronIndarkness and In doubt...
... asnightfallInwinter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell...
... boundto yourgrief under the fading trees...
... untilallthe worldIschanged...
... andthelongyearsofyourlife are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here...
... onlydeath.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy Is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet.
Saruman...
... todestroythe peopleofRohan .
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...
... thelastfreekingdomofMen .
his war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the ring Is close.
The strength of the RIng-bearer Is falling.
In his heart.
Frodo begins to understand...
... thequestwillclaimhislife.
You know this.
You have foreseen It.
It Is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark. the will of the ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find Its way back Into the hands of Men.
Men. who are so easily seduced by Its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...
... taketheringforhisown.
and the world will fall.
It Is close now.
So close to achieving Its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth...
... evenuntototheending of the world.
The time of the Elves...
... Isover.
Do we leave MIddle-earth to Its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
-How many?
-Some thousands.
More come every day.
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria...
... twoweremy kin...
... aDwarftherewas also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please...
... letmego downtohim.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but... .
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on...
... he'llfindme.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo... .
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you...
... twoHalflings...
... anda hostof menatmycall.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...
... toshowhisquality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please. it's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
-He's alive!
-Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest...
... andthemostrecklessman I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
-All lsengard is emptied.
-How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...
... tobereadyfor battlebynightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...
... orsetfootinsidetheHornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown...
... homesrebuilt.
Within these walls...
... wewilloutlastthem.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people...
... downtothelastchild.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end...
... astobe worthyofremembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon--?
No, my Lord Aragorn...
... wearealone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions--
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled...
... aboutthewarsofMenandwizards...
... fora verylongtime.
But now, something is about to happen...
... thathasnothappened...
... foranage.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents...
... willgoto war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
-Keep moving.
-Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred...
against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I , Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord...
... willfollowyoutowhateverend.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
LIke wind In the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West...
... behindthehills...
... IntoShadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma...
... thereisalwayshope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy...
for you shall receive none!
-What's happening out there?
-Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck...
and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
-Fire!
-Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 1 7!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot...
... andwehaveagreed...
... youarenotOrcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit...
... ittakesalongtime ...
... tosayanythinginOldEntish...
... andweneversay anything...
... unlessit is worthtaking...
... alongtimetosay.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
is this it?
is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread...
... andthewoodsofTuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And... .
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
-What?
-l cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
-Fall back!
-Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
-Turn around.
Take us south.
-South?
But that will lead you past lsengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then...
... youareverysmall.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please...
... letmego .
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice...
... thatclimbup sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they... .
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
... Entishor thetonguesofMen...
... forthistreachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight...
... withrockandstone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely...
... thatwego to ourdoom.
Last march...
... oftheEnts.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn...
... lookto theeast.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...
... shallsoundin theDeep...
... onelasttime.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath...
... nowforruinanda red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...
... becausehowcouldthe end behappy?
How could the world go back to the way It was...
... whenso muchbad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But In the end.
It's only a passing thing...
... thisshadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines.
It will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you...
... thatmeantsomething.
Even If you were too small to understand why.
But I think.
Mr. Frodo.
I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories...
... hadlotsofchancesofturningback, only they didn't.
They kept going...
... becausetheywereholding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...
... somewhereIn thewilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I .
"Samwise the Brave. "
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious...
... andwebe themaster!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky. lt's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
-Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
-Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
Subtitles by FredDKfeine [Te@mFDK]
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before... haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears... to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on... on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes... on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord... is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further... until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper... talk to each other... even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful... a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan... what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say... as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle... into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are... and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us... it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory... and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire... and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me... and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead... and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back... until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now... at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming... quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses... and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest... near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning... we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it... has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed... and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path... and some stairs.
And then... a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then... you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son... he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king... to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... in the bitter watches of the night... when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring... still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden... son of Thengel... too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you... from the spell.
You have no power here...
Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
I've only... ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyn?
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me... but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king... the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves... but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell... for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings... a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep... the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now... and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will... behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw... and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is... where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief... that there are no Dwarf women... and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock... but for a small culvert at its base... which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning... thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night... the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising... from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time... when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal... and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king... and all that you hope for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you... no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death... an image of the splendor of the kings of Men... in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt... as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell... bound to your grief under the fading trees... until all the world is changed... and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here... only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman... to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor... the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand... the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth... even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria... two were my kin... a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...
I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please... let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on... he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you... two Halflings... and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor... to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest... and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms... to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall... or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown... homes rebuilt.
Within these walls... we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people... down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end... as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn... we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled... about the wars of Men and wizards... for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen... that has not happened... for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents... will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord... will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West... behind the hills... into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying... good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama... there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot... and we have agreed... you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit... it takes a long time... to say anything in Old Entish... and we never say anything... unless it is worth taking... a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread... and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then... you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please... let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
Entish or the tongues of Men... for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight... with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely... that we go to our doom.
Last march... of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn... look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand... shall sound in the Deep... one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath... now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was... when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going... because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching... because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee... where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path... near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo... they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before... haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears... to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on... on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes... on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord... is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further... until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper... talk to each other... even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful... a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan... what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say... as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle... into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are... and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us... it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory... and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire... and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me... and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead... and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back... until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now... at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming... quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses... and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest... near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning... we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it... has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed... and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path... and some stairs.
And then... a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then... you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son... he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king... to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... in the bitter watches of the night... when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring... still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden... son of Thengel... too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you... from the spell.
You have no power here...
Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
I've only... ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyn?
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me... but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king... the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves... but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell... for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings... a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep... the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now... and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will... behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw... and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is... where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief... that there are no Dwarf women... and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock... but for a small culvert at its base... which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning... thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night... the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising... from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time... when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal... and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king... and all that you hope for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you... no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death... an image of the splendor of the kings of Men... in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt... as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell... bound to your grief under the fading trees... until all the world is changed... and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here... only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman... to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor... the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand... the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth... even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria... two were my kin... a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...
I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please... let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on... he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you... two Halflings... and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor... to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest... and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms... to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall... or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown... homes rebuilt.
Within these walls... we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people... down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end... as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn... we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled... about the wars of Men and wizards... for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen... that has not happened... for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents... will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord... will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West... behind the hills... into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying... good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama... there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot... and we have agreed... you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit... it takes a long time... to say anything in Old Entish... and we never say anything... unless it is worth taking... a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread... and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then... you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please... let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
Entish or the tongues of Men... for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight... with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely... that we go to our doom.
Last march... of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn... look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand... shall sound in the Deep... one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath... now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was... when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going... because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching... because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee... where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path... near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo... they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
GANDALF:
You cannot pass!
FRODO:
Gandalf!
GANDALF:
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
[ROARING]
[GRUNTS]
BOROMIR:
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
[ROARING AND YELLING]
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
[GRUNTS]
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
[YELLS]
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
SAM:
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
[RUMBLING]
[GASPING]
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
[THUNDER ROLLING]
SAM:
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
SAM:
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
[YELLING]
[SAM YELLS]
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
[SIGHS]
[WHIMPERS]
[GOLLUM SCREAMING]
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
[WHEEZING]
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
SMEAGOL:
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
GOLLUM:
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
SMEAGOL This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
PIPPIN:
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc:-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
[LAUGHING]
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Huh?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
[RUMBLING]
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
ARAGORN:
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
ARAGORN:
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
LEGOLAS:
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
SARUMAN:
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
[YELLING AND SQUEALING]
SARUMAN:
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
SARUMAN:
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
ORC:
But, my lord, there are too many!
We cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
WILD MAN:
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
SARUMAN:
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
SARUMAN:
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
[YELLING]
SARUMAN:
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
FREDA:
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
[SCREAMING]
Quickly!
Go, child.
SARUMAN:
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
[THUNDER ROLLING]
[HOOVES BEATING]
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
EOWYN:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
THEODEN:
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
[GRUNTING]
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
[YELLS]
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
ORC 1:
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[GROANING]
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
LEADER:
Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
[ROARING]
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
squeal
No one's going to save you now.
[HORSES NEIGHING]
MERRY:
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
[HOOVES BEATING]
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would out off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
[WHISTLES]
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[YELLS]
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
MERRY:
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
[TREES GROANING]
PIPPIN:
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.

[HOBBITS GRUNTING]
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods any more.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
[HOBBITS GROANING]
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Half lings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
GOLLUM:
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, Yes-
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
And we are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
GOLLUM:
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
[COUGHS]
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
SAM:
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
GOLLUM:
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
[FRODO GASPS]
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
FRODO:
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
[THUNDER ROLLING]
GOLLUM:
So bright.
So beautiful.

What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?

What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.

What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

WHITE WIZARD:

Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD:
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
[ROARING AND YELLING]
GANDALF:
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
GIMLI:
Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested--?
[TREES GROANING]
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
[WHISTLING]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GANDALF:
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD:
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Oh.
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
SMEAGOL The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
SMEAGOL:
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
[HORNS BLOWING]
[ROARS]
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
SMEAGOL:
No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
[RUMBLING]
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
PIPPIN:
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
[GROANING]
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
[ENTISH GROAN]
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
'You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
[ENTISH GROAN] 3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
PIPPIN:
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
MERRY:
I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
[GRUNTING]
No!
PIPPIN:
Help!
TREEBEARD:
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
GANDALF:
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
EOWYN:
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
- Your staff.
- Hm?
Oh...
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
[DOOR LOCKS]
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
I'll news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the Wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
[LAUGHS]
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[GROANING]
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
SARUMAN:
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
[YELLING]
[GROANS]
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
[YELLS]
[GROANS]
WORMTONGUE:
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
WORMTONGUE:
Send me not from your sight.
ARAGORN:
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
WORMTONGUE:
Get out of my way!
MAN:
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
[CHANTING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
THEODEN:
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
GANDALF:
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
[SPEAKING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
EOWYN:
Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
THEODEN:
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
[BURPS]
Then what is the king's decision?
HAMA:
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI:
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They Will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
[ARAGORN SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
[IN ELVISH]
[CONTINUES SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
WORMTONGUE:
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
SARUMAN:
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
WORMTONGUE:
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
[GROWLING]
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it'?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM:
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
SMEAGOL No.
Not master.
GOLLUM:
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
SMEAGOL Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me
Not any more.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
SMEAGOL Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
[CHUCKLING]
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
[SMEAGOL SHRIEKING]
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
SAM:
Who are they?
SMEAGOL:
Wicked Men
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
[OLIPHAUNT GROANS]
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
[GROANING]
No one at home will believe this.
[BIRD WHISTLES]
Sméagol?
[ARROWS FLYING]
[SCREAMING]
[OLIPHAUNTS TRUMPETING]
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
No!
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
GIMLI:
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
[YELLS]
GIMLI:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
ARWEN:
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] Arwen...
EOWYN:
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND:
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] Why are you saying this?
[IN ENGLISH] I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
EOWYN:
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
[YELLING AND ROARING]
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLI:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
[WARGS BARKING]
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLI:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
EOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLI:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
[SNIFFS]
[GRUNTING]
[YELLS]
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
[LAUGHING]
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... ."dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
[CHOKES]
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
WOMAN 1:
At last!
WOMAN 2:
Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 3:
There it is, Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 4:
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
FREDA:
Mama!
MORWEN:
Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
MAN:
Make way for the king.
GAMLING:
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING:
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
THEODEN:
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
WORMTONGUE:
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
SARUMAN:
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
SARUMAN:
Tens of thousands.
WORMTONGUE:
But, my lord, there is no such force.
[HORNS SOUNDING]
[ARMY CHEERING]
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
TREEBEARD:
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
ARWEN:
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
ELROND:
Arwen.
[IN ELVISH]
I have made my choice.
[IN ENGLISH] He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH]
[GALADRIEL SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
GALADRIEL [IN ENGLISH]:
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
[ROARING]
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
FARAMIR:
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gang rel creature
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
[MEN CHEERING]
MEN:
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
DENETHOR:
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
MAN:
Captain Faramir!
[WHISPERING] We found the third one.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool ls nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
[YELLS]
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
[FOOTSTEP]
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
[MUFFLED CRIES]
[GRUNTING AND PANTING]
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
[CRYING]
FARAMIR:
Answer me.
GOLLUM:
Sméagol.
[CRYING]
GOLLUM:
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
SMEAGOL Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
GOLLUM:
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
SMEAGOL Master is our friend.
Our friend.
GOLLUM:
Master betrayed us.
SMEAGOL No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
GOLLUM:
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
SMEAGOL No.
No.
What did they steal?
GOLLUM:
My precious!
[YELLS]
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Half lings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
[VOICE OF THE RING WHISPERING]
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
SAM:
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
[DISTANT MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
WOMAN:
He's alive!
GIMLI:
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] You look terrible.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[DOORS OPENING]
A great host, you say?
[IN ENGLISH] All Isengard is emptied.
How many?
ARAGORN:
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN:
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon--?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
MAN 1:
We need more time to lay provisions--
THEODEN:
There is no time.
War is upon us.
MAN 2:
Secure the gate.
[CAWING]
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
[RUMBLING]
TREEBEARD:
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
GUARD 1:
Move back!
Move to the caves!
GUARD 2:
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
[BABY CRYING]
EOWYN:
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
[BABY CRYING]
[MUTED SPEECH]
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
[IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH]
Aragorn.
[IN ENGLISH] Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLI:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
[ENTS GROANING]
Huh?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
TREEBEARD:
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
GUARD:
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
[IN ELVISH]
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
[HORN BLOWING]
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
GUARD:
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[INDISTINCT GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
GIMLI:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
[THUNDER ROLLS]
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[BABY CRYING]
[IN ELVISH]
[ROARS]
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
[URUK-HAI BATTLE CRIES]
[GROANS]
So it begins.
[IN ELVISH]
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
[IN ENGLISH] Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
[IN ENGLISH] I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
[ENTS GROANING]
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time To say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
[ARAGORN SHOUTS IN ELVISH]
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
[IN ELVISH]
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH]
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
[ENTS GRUMBLING]
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING:
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
[IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
GIMLI:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
[SHOUTING IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make Way!
We cannot hold much longer!
THEODEN:
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
MAN 1:
Make way!
MAN 2:
Follow me to the barricade.
MAN 1:
Watch our backs!
MAN 3:
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
MAN 4:
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
THEODEN:
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
GAMLING:
Fall back!
THEODEN:
Retreat!
ARAGORN:
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
THEODEN:
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
MAN:
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
FRODO:
Faramir!
You must let me go!
TREEBEARD:
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
[GASPS]
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
[ROARING]
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
[GROANING AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Yes.
TREEBEARD:
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
[MUTED SPEECH]
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
ITHILIEN RANGER:
Watch out!
[RUMBLING]
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Nazgul!
[ROARING]
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
THEODEN:
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
WOMAN 1:
They're breaking in!
WOMAN 2:
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
GANDALF:
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
[HORN BLOWS]
Forth Eorlingas!

Not alone.

TREEBEARD:
A hit.
A fine hit.
[TREEBEARD GRUNTS]
TREEBEARD:
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
[RUMBLING]
[ROARING]
[YELLS]
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
[PANTING]
[SWORD CLANGS]
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
SAM:
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
[HOOVES BEATING]
EOMER:
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
[SCREAMING AND YELLING]
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
MERRY:
He doesn't look happy, does he?
PIPPIN:
Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
[HOBBITS LAUGHING]
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
SMEAGOL: it is the only way
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
SAM:
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Nice master.
- Nice Hobbits.
SAM:
Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
[RUMBLING]
GANDALF:
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
FRODO:
Sméagol?
SAM:
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.
SMEAGOL Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
SAM:
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
FRODO:
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.

flame of Udűn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
The Two Towers
Can you see the bottom?
Sam!
Just keep going!
Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Mr. Frodo?
really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food... it's not bad.
Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
we hates them!
and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
pits.
thousands of Orcses.
watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
the old villain.
So much for his promises.
Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-Iords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
there are too many!
we don't have the means.
work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
Mama.
Mama.
I will find you there.
Quickly!
child.
my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
Gríma?
you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
and I shall give you mine.
Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
son of Arathorn.
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
Hiro îth... ab 'wanath.--
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Merry!
Little Orcs.
Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Merry.
Don't encourage it!
some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
yes.
master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
then.
And good riddance!
cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
my friend.
The Elves began it.
teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... tree-infested...?
charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
that's good.
Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nűmenor still lives.
Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
indeed?
Good.
very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
master says so.
I did.
then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
no!
Master!
Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
Sam.
no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
snake!
but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only... my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Bealocwealm hafad fréone frecan forth onsended giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende on Meduselde... durh niedig rest.
Bealo...
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
Ferđu.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
burning as they go.
cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked... was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
and now I have no time.
my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
look to the east.
Go.
my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
Faste... stille nú.
uu... gefragon.
Hwat nemna?
?
e?
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
Brego.
Man cenich?
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man... from the North.
I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
Mr. Frodo.
Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
precious.
False.
lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
stick them in a stew.
golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
you don't see many Dwarf women.
they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
to tend her king in growing fear.
who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dűnedain.
blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war... grief... despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
for me.
Follow me!
charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
Helm's Deep will fall.
it would take a number beyond reckoning... to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
I'd hoped you would tell me.
we would have you tell us.
about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
little brother.
life is good.
What?
He's here.
can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
but our numbers were too few.
too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
and yet he tries to do your will.
Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir... and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
you are strong.
And our need is great.
our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
I see.
to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
now.
You can do it.
Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
laddie.
where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Gamling?
sire.
And do you trust your king?
my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
Legolas.
I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
let's hope it lasts the night.
Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
root and twig.
young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Saruman?
Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
then.
little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
NazgűI!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
Sam?
Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
Frodo Baggins.
the laws of your father.
your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
Merry.
I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
South Farthing
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... sir.
The very highest.
Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
so we must try.
I must.
Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
don't you?
see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
no hard feelings.
Gollum.
master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Gollum.
his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.
"Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories.
Dad?
my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot.
you've left out one of the chief characters:
Samwise the Brave.
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
Samwise the Brave.
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it? They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry! What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan under pain of death.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry! I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
Get back, scum!
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of GIoin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Hmm.
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Oh.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Oh.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head-on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
Who are they?
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Aye!
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
GIMLl:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen... Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLl:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLl:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
GIMLl:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
At last!
Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
Mama!
Eothain!
Freda!
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLl:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Smeagol.
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
He's alive!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king? You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Keep moving.
Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLl:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
GIMLl:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
ARAGORN
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box? So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on! Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
Huh?
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Twenty-two and 23!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman? Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli! The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there! Haldir! GIMLl:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Oh, come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back! They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
Fall back!
Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave. "
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested-?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- ... and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- ... was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- ... send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Smeagol.
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon-?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions-
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- ... 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories. "
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot. "
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave. "
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave. "
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-Iords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
We cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
And we are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once... this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen...
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war... grief... despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
Do I not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
NazgûI!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.

- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before... haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears... to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on... on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes... on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord... is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further... until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper... talk to each other... even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful... a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan... what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say... as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle... into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are... and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us... it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory... and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire... and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me... and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead... and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back... until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now... at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming... quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses... and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest... near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning... we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it... has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed... and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path... and some stairs.
And then... a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then... you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son... he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king... to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... in the bitter watches of the night... when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring... still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden... son of Thengel... too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you... from the spell.
You have no power here...
Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
I've only... ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyn?
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me... but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king... the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves... but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell... for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings... a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep... the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now... and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will... behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw... and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is... where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief... that there are no Dwarf women... and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock... but for a small culvert at its base... which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning... thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night... the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising... from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time... when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal... and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king... and all that you hope for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you... no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death... an image of the splendor of the kings of Men... in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt... as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell... bound to your grief under the fading trees... until all the world is changed... and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here... only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman... to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor... the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand... the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth... even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria... two were my kin... a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...
I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please... let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on... he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you... two Halflings... and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor... to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest... and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms... to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall... or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown... homes rebuilt.
Within these walls... we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people... down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end... as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn... we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled... about the wars of Men and wizards... for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen... that has not happened... for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents... will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord... will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West... behind the hills... into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying... good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama... there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot... and we have agreed... you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit... it takes a long time... to say anything in Old Entish... and we never say anything... unless it is worth taking... a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread... and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then... you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please... let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
Entish or the tongues of Men... for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight... with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely... that we go to our doom.
Last march... of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn... look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand... shall sound in the Deep... one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath... now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was... when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going... because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching... because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee... where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path... near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo... they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!
I'm the servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the shadow!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
Nooooooooo!
Gandalf!
What is it Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle Earth we don't want to see any closer.
It's the one place we are trying to get to.
It's just where we cant get.
Let's face it Mr. Frodo.
We're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam.
...but they did.
Mr.Frodo?
It's the Ring isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Well, let me see.
Oh yes, lovely
Lembas bread!
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold to foreign food, but this elvish stuff is not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
Those rainclouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
That's because we've been here before!
We are going in circles!
Ah!
What's that 'orrid stink?
I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
Can you smell it?
Yes I can smell it.
We are not alone.
Those thieves!
Those filthy little thieves!
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us
My precious.
We hate them!
We hate them!
We want it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before!
haven't you, Gollum!
Release him or I'll cut your throat!
It burns!
It burns us!
Take it off!
-Quiet you!
It's hopeless!
Every Orc in Mordor will hear this racket!
-Let's tie him up and leave him!
-No!
That will kill us, kill us!
It's nothing more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
Now that I've seen him, I do pity him.
We be very nice to hobbits, you be nice to us.
We swear to do what you wants.
We swear!
There is no promise you make that I can trust.
We swear to serve the master of the precious.
We swear on on the precious.
Gollum, Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the preciouss.
I don't believe you!
Get down!
-Get down!
-Sam!
He was trying to trick us!
We let him go he'll throttle us into our sleep!
-Do You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail!
Let's go!
Their pace quickens.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on Gimli!
Three day's and night's pursuit.
No food... no rest and no sign of our quarry but what bare Rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us, come!
Rohan, home of the horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets it's will against us.
Legolas!
What does your elf eyes see?
The Uruks turn to West.
They are taking the hobbits to Isengard!
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard ...and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, Lord Sauron, ...we shall rule this Middle-Earth.
The old world will burn in the fires of industry.
Forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machinery of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the Orcs.
We now have only to remove those who oppose us.
The horsemen have taken your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch the living of Rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in the Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
But Papa says Eothain must not ride.
He's too big for him!
Listen to me!
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm
-Do You understand me?
-Yes mum!
I don't wanna go!
I don't wanna go, mama!
Freda, listen to me.
I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child!
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Theodred!
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie!
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grimá.
Grimá.
Grimá.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked, unchallenged, killing at will.
Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is weary of your malcontent.
...your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long has it been since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grimá?
When all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer son of Eomund.
Too much.
They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We ain't goin' no further till we've had a breather.
Get the fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think, we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest?
On the borders of Buckland?
Folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
What about them?
They're flesh!
They are not for eating!
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
Ooh!
They look tasty!
Get back!
Just a mouthful?
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu boys!
Pippin!
Let's go!
Go on, call for help.
Squeal!
No one's gonna save you now!
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan!
What news from the Mark?
What business does an elf, a man, and a dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell!
I'm Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas from the Woodland realm
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your King.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claim lordship over this lands.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there they say as an old man.
Hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a band of Uruk-Hai westward across the plains.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Do you see two Hobbits with them?
They will be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
They're dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends, but do not trust a hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
It's one of their Elven belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here and the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here and were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into...
Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drew them there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm gonna rip off both your little heads!
Come here!
Trees!
Climb a tree!
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot-hole in your belly.
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs!
It's talking Merry.The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
Treeherder!
Shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it Merry.
Don't encourage it.
Treebeard some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody is on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs.
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire they come with axes.
Biting, breaking, hacking, burning.
Destroyers and usurpers Curse them!
No!
You don't understand.
We are Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shirefolk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't
The White Wizard will know.
White Wizard?
Saruman!
See, see!
We have led you out!
Hurry, hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice hobbit.
It's a bog!
He's led us into a swamp!
Swamp, yes, yes!
Come master.
We will take you to safe paths, through the mist.
Come Hobbits, come.
We move quickly!
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it
They go round for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Swift and quick like shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water!
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcs.
A great battle long ago.
The Dead Marshes.
Yes, yes!
That is the name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights!
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you alright?
So bright, so beautiful.
Ah precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master need to keep up his strength.
Who are you?
Musn't ask us it's name not his business.
Gollum, Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
He said your life was was a sad story.
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once were you?
Smeagol?
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My...
My name
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on Frodo, Come on!
They will see us!
They will see us
- I thought they were dead!
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's alright.
I'm here.
Hurry, hobbits!
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood!
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memories and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your axe.
Aragorn, something is out there!
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will out a spell on us!
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be!
You fell!
Through fire.... ...and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought him, the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me.... ...and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf!
Gandalf?
Oh yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf!
I am Gandalf the White now.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of the journey is over, another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax
He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
My home.
I sleep in the forest here.
The roots of the mountains.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have gone wild and dangerous.
Anger is in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us that are left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw this.
Master says show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does what master says so.
I did.
We cannot get past them.
Look!
The gate, it's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam!
No!
Master!
- I Do not ask You to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt these elvish cloaks will help us in there.
Now!
No!
No!
No master!
They catch you!
They catch you.
Don't take it to Him.
He wants the precious.
Always he's looking for it!
And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him.
But we musn't let him have it.
No!
There is another way.
More secret and dark way.
Why haven't you spoke of this before?
Because master did not ask!
He is up to something.
Are you saying is another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There is a path and some stairs .
And then a tunnel.
He has led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no!
He's been true to his word.
No!
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always help.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld
Here dwells Theoden, King of Rohan ...whose mind is overthrown... and Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son is dead
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
He must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand his passing is hard to accept.
especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, you snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
The bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you 0
So fair.
So cold.
like a morning pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden-king so armed, Gandalf Grayhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
Oh.
No, you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
My Lord.
Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Theoden-King.
He is not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question my lord.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent!
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not pass trough dead to bandy a few words with a witless worm.
Your staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff!
Theoden Son of Thengel too long have you sat in the shadows.
I would stay still, if I were you!
Listen to me!
I will release you from the spell.
Wait.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn!
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever...
served you my lord.
Your witchcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your side!
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden, King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyne.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
At last, that these evil days shall be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the wildmen are moving through Westfold.
Burning as they go...
Rick, cot and tree.
Where's momma?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from the women and children.
You must fight!
You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be three hundred leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what is that you want of me.
But I would not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep!
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He is only doing what he thinks is best for his people
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that of ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he is leading them to safety.
But what he'll get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong hold but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end there, Aragorn
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That is what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of men have walked this earth and now, I have no time.
Good luck.
My search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming.
At first light of the fifth day at dawn, look to the East.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You are a daughter of kings.
A shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that will be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It is vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
It will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Hey Stinker!
Don't go getting too far ahead!
Why do you do that?
- What?
- Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because:
...because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him.
What is still doing to him.
I want to help him Sam.
Why?
a
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taking a hold of you Mr Frodo.
You have to fight it.
I know what I have to do Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me
It's my task!
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We need it.
Must have the Precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little hobbitses.
Wicked, tricky, filth!
No!
No!
Master.
Yes.
Precious first.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
Not listening.
You+re a liar and a thief.
No.o
Murderer!
Go away!
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum!
Gollum!
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No!
m
Leave now and never come back!
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away!
And away he goes, precious.
Gone, gone, gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look!
Look!
See what Smeagol finds!
They are young!
They are tender and nice.
Yes they are!
Eat them.
Eat them!
Make him sick you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
Whats he doing!
Stupid fat hobbit!
You ruin it!
e
Whats to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need it a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Po-ta-toes!
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh yes we could.
Spoiling nice fish!
Give it to us raw:
...and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips!
You're hopeless.
Mr Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
It will soon be ready.
- Ready to Do What?
- to make His war
The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
We've got to keep moving.
Come on Sam.
Mr. Frodo!
Look!
It's an Oliphant!
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here for too long.
Come on Sam!
Ah!
Bind their hands.
It's true you don't see many dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... ..they are often mistaken for dwarf men.
It's the beards.
And this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no dwarf women.
And the dwarves just, spring out of holes in the ground!
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.n
You told me once this day would come.
This is not the end... it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen.
If you trust nothing else... trust this:
trust us.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel?
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hoped for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality...
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time.... ...Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you.
No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death.
An image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory, undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...
As night falling winter has come without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to you grief, under the fading trees until all the world has changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
I've made my choice.
At last!
Helmsdeep!
There it is, Helmsdeep!
We're saved, my lady!
Thank you!
Make way for the king!
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate and set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight my lord?
- the women and children?
- Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has but one weakness.
It's outer wall is solid Rock for for except for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device can break down a wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
It's victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Man.
Look!
The smoke to the south!
There is always smoke rising up from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now, he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army!
The war has started.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand to take the Ring for his own and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving it's goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even until the ending of the world.
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshalling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.
How many?
Some thousands.
More come every day.
Who's covering the river to the north?
- we pulled five hundred men out of Osgiliath.
But if the city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies!
Now wait just a minute!
Well if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak!
We are hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favoured look.
He is our guide
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria.
Two were my kin.
A dwarf there was also.
And an elf.
And two men Aragorn, son of Arathorn and Boromir of Gondor.
You were friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It would grieve you then to learn that he is dead?
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I had hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the deeping wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs!
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on Rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown.
Homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages!
They come to destroy its people down to the last child!
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance!
Send out riders, my lord
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
Where was Gon...?
No, my lord Aragorn we are alone.
- Get the women and children into the caves.
- we need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord.
- There is no time.
War is upon us!
Secure the gate.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
And there's little family of field mice that climb up sometimes:
...and it tickles me awfully.
They're always trying to get somebody.
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
They had voices of their own.
There is no curse in elvish:
...entish or the tongues of men:
...for this treachery!
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
Move to the caves!
Quickly now!
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Every villager able to wield a sword:
...has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
You're men, my lord:
...will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the west:
...behind the hills:
...into shadow.
How did it come to this?
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword:
...Haleth, son of Hama.
There is always hope.
So it begins.
Give them a volley.
Fire!
- Legolas, two already!
- I'm on seventeen!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
The ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time.
But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Ent moot.
What's that?
It is a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech, Oak, Chestnut, Ash.
Good, good, good many have come.
Now we must decide if the ents will go to war.
Captain Faramir!
We found it...
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall they shoot?
Rock and pool is nice and cool.
So juicy sweet.
I only wish to catch a fish!
So juicy sweet!
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
Please let me go down to him.
Smeagol!
Master is here!
Come, Smeagol!
Trust master.
Come!
We must... go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me, come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol don't struggle!
Smeagol listen to me!
Master!
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
Twenty.
Twenty one.
Twenty two.
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman.
Brace the gates!
Hold them!
Stand fast!
Aragorn!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the ent moot:
...and we have agreed...?
...you are not Orcs.
Well that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help!
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War, yes.
It affects us all.
But you must understand, young hobbit:
...it takes a long time:
...to say anything in old entish.
And we never say anything:
...unless it is worth taking:
...a long time to say.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me!
Smeagol?
Why do you cry, Smeagol?
Cruel men hurt us.
Master tricked us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricky.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend... our friend.
Master betrayed us!
No, not it's business.
Leave us alone.
Filthy little hobbits!
They stole It from us!
No... no.
What did they steal?
My Precious!
We have to get out of here.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.t
Disappear.r
I can't.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on He'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So... this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the wild I have you.
Two haflings and a host of men at my call.
And the Ring of power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
The Ring will not save Gondor.
Leave him alone!
It has only the power to destroyih
Please...wš ...let me go.
Don't you understand?
Hurry.
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going.
Into Mordor.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
To the Mountain of Fire.
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
e
Prepare to leave.
Aragorn!
Pull back to the keep!
Brace the gate!
To the gate!
Draw your swords!
We can't hold much longer.
Pull everybody back!
Pull them back!
Pull back!
˜
They've broken through!
The castle is free!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside!
Get them inside!
Come, to the keep!
The ents cannot weather such things as we have always done.
We must hold back this war.
Yes!
Come my friends!
The ents are going to war.
It is likely:
...that we go to our doom
The last march:
...of the ents.
They're breaking in!
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn:
...look to the East.
Yes.
Yes!
The Horn of Helm Hammerhand:
...shall sound in the deep:
...one last time.
Yes!
c;
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds awake.
Now for wrath:
...now for ruin:
...and the red dawn!
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden-king stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin, hold on!
Hold on, little hobbits!
Victory!
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits:
...somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.
And they'll say, 'yes, that's one of my favorite stories.
Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, dad.
Yes, my boy:
the most famousest of hobbits.
And that's saying a lot.
'You left out one of the chief characters.
Samwise the Brave.
I want to hear more about Sam
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
Samwise the Brave.
Smeagol?
We're not gonna wait for you.
Come on!
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise!
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us!
Wicked, tricky, false!
We ought to ring his filthy little neck!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
Then we take the Precious:
...and we be the master!
But the fat hobbit.He knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out!
Put out his eyses.
And make him crawl.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Kill them both.
Yes!
No.
No!
It's too risky, it's too risky!
Where's he gone?
- Gollum, where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious she could!
And then we take it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Hush!
Come on, hobbits.
Long ways to go yet!
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udún!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-Iords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dúr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Númenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dúnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dúnedain.
A descendant of Númenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Éothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- Lf there is need to go to Rivendell send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
I nside.
Get them inside!
I nto the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgúl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count 42.
- Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
GANDALF:
You cannot pass!
FRODO:
Gandalf!
GANDALF:
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
[ROARING]
[GRUNTS]
BOROMIR:
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
[ROARING AND YELLING]
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
[GRUNTS]
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
[YELLS]
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
SAM:
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
-What's in this?
-Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
[RUMBLING]
[GASPING]
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
[THUNDER ROLLING]
SAM:
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
SAM:
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
[YELLING]
[SAM YELLS]
This is Sting.
You've seen it before haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
[SIGHS]
[WHIMPERS]
[GOLLUM SCREAMING]
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
-Get down!
I said, down!
-Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
[WHEEZING]
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate. GOLLUM:
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
Follow me!
PIPPIN:
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
[LAUGHING]
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
-Leave him alone!
-Why?
You want some?
Huh?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
-You're hurt.
-I'm fine.
-It was just an act.
-An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
[RUMBLING]
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
ARAGORN:
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
ARAGORN:
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
LEGOLAS:
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
SARUMAN:
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron we shall rule this Middle-earth.
[YELLING AND SQUEALING]
SARUMAN:
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
SARUMAN:
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
ORC:
But, my lord, there are too many!
We cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
-Burn it.
-Yes.
WILD MAN:
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
SARUMAN:
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
SARUMAN:
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
[YELLING]
SARUMAN:
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
FREDA:
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
[SCREAMING]
Quickly!
Go, child.
SARUMAN:
Rohan, my lord is ready to fall.
[THUNDER ROLLING]
[HOOVES BEATING]
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
-Mordor will pay for this.
-These Orcs are not from Mordor.
He's alive.
Théodred.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
Too much.
[GRUNTING]
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
[YELLS]
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
ORC 1:
We're not going no further until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
[GROANING]
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper talk to each other even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
-They look tasty.
LEADER:
Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
-They think we have the Ring.
-Shh.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
[ROARING]
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
[HORSES NEIGHING]
MERRY:
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
[HOOVES BEATING]
Riders of Rohan what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
[WHISTLES]
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[YELLS]
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
MERRY:
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
[TREES GROANING]
PIPPIN:
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
[SNARLING]
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
[GROWLING]
Merry!
[GROANS]
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
[HOBBITS GRUNTING]
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
[HOBBITS GROANING]
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
-Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
-No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
GOLLUM:
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
Oh!
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
And we are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
GOLLUM:
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
[COUGHS]
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
SAM:
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
GOLLUM:
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
[FRODO GASPS]
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.
FRODO:
Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you all right?
[THUNDER ROLLING]
GOLLUM:
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
[FRODO GROANING]
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
-I thought they were dead.
-Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
[ROARS] Wraiths on wings!
[SCREECHING]
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
[ROARS] The Black Gate is very close.
[SPITS]
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory and anger.
[TREES GROANING]
The trees are speaking to each other.
ARAGORN:
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
[IN ELVISH] Something's out there.
[IN ELVISH] What do you see?
[IN ENGLISH] The White Wizard approaches.
[IN ENGLISH] Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
WHITE WIZARD:
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD:
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
[ROARING AND YELLING]
GANDALF:
Until at last I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
-We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
GIMLI:
Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested--?
[TREES GROANING]
I mean, charming quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
-Hm?
-You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
-...and find that they are strong.
-Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
[WHISTLING]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
That is one of the Mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
GANDALF:
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses and has been my friend through many dangers.
TREEBEARD:
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
-Is it much further?
-Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Oh.
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Númenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
[HORNS BLOWING]
[ROARS]
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
[EASTERLINGS YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
-I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
-Now!
SMÉAGOL:
No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path and some stairs.
And then a tunnel.
[RUMBLING]
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
PIPPIN:
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
[GROANING]
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
[ENTISH GROAN]
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
-Who?
-You!
-Than what?
-Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
[ENTISH GROAN] 3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
PIPPIN:
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
MERRY:
I want some!
-It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
[GRUNTING]
No!
PIPPIN:
Help!
TREEBEARD:
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
-Are there Ent children?
-Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
-Why is that?
-We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
-How did they die?
-Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
GANDALF:
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong. ...he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness in the bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
Ah.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
-Your staff.
-Hm?
Oh....
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
[DOOR LOCKS]
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden son of Thengel too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you from the spell.
[LAUGHS]
You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
[GROANING]
Wait.
SARUMAN'S VOICE:
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me you will not kill him.
SARUMAN:
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
[YELLING]
[GROANS]
I know your face.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped your sword.
[YELLS]
[GROANS]
WORMTONGUE:
I've only ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
WORMTONGUE:
Send me not from your sight.
ARAGORN:
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
WORMTONGUE:
Get out of my way!
MAN:
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
[CHANTING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE] Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
GANDALF:
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
[SPEAKING IN ROHIRRIM ANCESTRAL LANGUAGE]
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
-Where is Mama?
ÉOWYN:
Shh.
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
I know what it is you want of me but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. ...Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
[BURPS]
Then what is the king's decision? ...the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
GIMLI:
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
[HORSE NEIGHING]
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
[ARAGORN SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
[IN ELVISH] Your name is kingly.
[CONTINUES SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
I have heard of the magic of Elves but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
WORMTONGUE:
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
-...was he from Gondor?
-No, from the North.
One of the Dúnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
SARUMAN:
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
WORMTONGUE:
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
[GROWLING]
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
-Why do you do that?
-What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
-You have to fight it.
-I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
GOLLUM:
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False. GOLLUM:
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie! You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free! Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
[CHUCKLING]
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
[BIRD WHISTLING]
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
SAM:
Who are they?
SMÉAGOL:
Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
[OLIPHAUNT GROANS]
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
[GROANING]
No one at home will believe this.
[BIRD WHISTLES]
Sméagol?
[ARROWS FLYING]
[SCREAMING]
[OLIPHAUNTS TRUMPETING]
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
No!
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
GIMLI:
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground which is, of course, ridiculous.
[YELLS]
GIMLI:
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man, who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't.
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
-It's good.
-Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dúnedain.
A descendant of Númenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
ARWEN:
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
[IN ELVISH] You told me once... this day would come.
[IN ELVISH] This is not the end...it is the beginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
[IN ENGLISH] Arwen....
If you trust nothing else... trust this... trust us.
The woman who gave you that jewel.
ELROND:
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
[IN ELVISH] Is this how you would take your leave?
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?
[IN ELVISH] I will not be coming back.
You underestimate your skill in battle.
You will come back.
It is not of death in battle that I speak.
What do you speak of?
You have a chance for another life... away from war...grief...despair.
[IN ENGLISH] Why are you saying this?
[IN ENGLISH] I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
What is it?
-Háma?
-I'm not sure.
[YELLING AND ROARING]
Wargs!
A scout!
-What is it?
What do you see?
-Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
GIMLI:
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
[WARGS BARKING]
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
-I can fight.
-No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
Hyah!
GIMLI:
Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
ÉOWYN:
Make for the lower ground!
-That's it!
Go on!
-Stay together!
GIMLI:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
[SNIFFS]
[GRUNTING]
[YELLS]
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
[LAUGHING]
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
[CHOKES]
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
WOMAN 1:
At last!
WOMAN 2:
Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 3:
There it is, Helm's Deep.
WOMAN 4:
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
FREDA:
Mama!
MORWEN:
Éothain!
Freda!
-Where is the rest?
-This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
MAN:
Make way for the king.
GAMLING:
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
GIMLI:
My lady.
Lord Aragorn where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
GAMLING:
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children? Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
WORMTONGUE:
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
SARUMAN:
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands, to storm the Keep.
SARUMAN:
Tens of thousands.
WORMTONGUE:
But, my lord, there is no such force.
[HORNS SOUNDING]
[ARMY CHEERING]
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
TREEBEARD:
There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
ARWEN:
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
ELROND:
Arwen.
[IN ELVISH] It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.
I have made my choice.
[IN ENGLISH] He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here only death.
[IN ELVISH] Do I not also have your love?
[IN ELVISH] You have my love, father.
[GALADRIEL SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
GALADRIEL [IN ENGLISH]:
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
[ROARING]
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth even unto the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
-How many?
-Some thousands.
More come every day.
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
FARAMIR:
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria two were my kin a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
[MEN CHEERING]
MEN:
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
-Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
DENETHOR:
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
-He loves you, Father.
-Do not trouble me with Faramir I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
-Isildur's Bane.
-It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
-Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
-Would you deny your own father?
-If there is need to go to Rivendell...
-...send me in his stead.
-You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
MAN:
Captain Faramir!
[WHISPERING] We found the third one.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
[YELLS]
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please let me go down to him.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
[FOOTSTEP]
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
[MUFFLED CRIES]
[GRUNTING AND PANTING]
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
[CRYING]
FARAMIR:
Answer me.
GOLLUM:
Sméagol.
[CRYING]
GOLLUM:
Why does it cry, Sméagol? Master tricksed us.
GOLLUM:
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Our friend.
GOLLUM:
Master betrayed us.
Leave us alone!
GOLLUM:
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us! What did they steal?
GOLLUM:
My precious!
[YELLS]
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but....
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo....
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you two Halflings and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor to show his quality.
[VOICE OF THE RING WHISPERING]
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
SAM:
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
[DISTANT MARCHING FOOTSTEPS]
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
WOMAN:
He's alive!
GIMLI:
Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
[IN ELVISH] You're late.
[IN ENGLISH] You look terrible.
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[DOORS OPENING]
A great host, you say?
[IN ENGLISH] All Isengard is emptied.
How many?
ARAGORN:
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown homes rebuilt.
Within these walls we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
ARAGORN:
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon--?
No, my Lord Aragorn we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
MAN 1:
We need more time to lay provisions-- MAN 2:
Secure the gate.
[CAWING]
We Ents have not troubled about the wars of Men and wizards for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen that has not happened for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
[RUMBLING]
TREEBEARD:
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
GUARD 1:
Move back!
Move to the caves!
GUARD 2:
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
[BABY CRYING] I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
-Let me stand at your side.
-It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
[BABY CRYING]
[MUTED SPEECH]
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
[IN ELVISH] And they should be...
Three hundred... against ten thousand!
[IN ELVISH] They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
Aragorn.
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
[IN ENGLISH] Then I shall die as one of them!
GIMLI:
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
[ENTS GROANING]
Huh?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
TREEBEARD:
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
GUARD:
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying that we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
[IN ELVISH] There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
[HORN BLOWING]
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
-Open the gate!
GUARD:
Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
[SPEAKING IN ELVISH]
[IN ENGLISH] You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[INDISTINCT GRUNTING AND GROWLING]
GIMLI:
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
[THUNDER ROLLS]
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
[MARCHING FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[BABY CRYING]
[IN ELVISH] Show them no mercy... for you shall receive none!
[ROARS]
-What's happening out there?
-Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
[URUK-HAI BATTLE CRIES]
HOLD!
[GROANS]
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
[IN ELVISH] Their armour is weak at the neck... and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
-Fire!
-Fire!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
[IN ENGLISH] Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
[IN ENGLISH] I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
[ENTS GROANING]
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit it takes a long time to say anything in Old Entish and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
[ARAGORN SHOUTS IN ELVISH]
Is this it?
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
[IN ELVISH] Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
[SPEAKS IN ELVISH]
[IN ELVISH] Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
[ENTS GRUMBLING]
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And....
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
GAMLING:
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
[IN ELVISH] To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
GIMLI:
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
[SHOUTING IN ELVISH]
Haldir!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer! As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
MAN:
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
-What?
-I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
MAN 1:
Make way!
MAN 2:
Follow me to the barricade.
MAN 1:
Watch our backs!
MAN 3:
Throw another one over here!
-Higher!
MAN 4:
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back! The castle is breached.
Retreat!
GAMLING:
Fall back!
THÉODEN:
Retreat!
ARAGORN:
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside! I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
-Turn around.
Take us south.
-South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
MAN:
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please let me go.
Hurry.
FRODO:
Faramir!
You must let me go!
TREEBEARD:
And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they....
[GASPS]
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
[ROARING]
There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight with rock and stone.
[GROANING AND FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Yes.
TREEBEARD:
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely that we go to our doom.
Last march of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
[MUTED SPEECH]
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
ITHILIEN RANGER:
Watch out!
[RUMBLING]
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
[RINGWRAITH SCREECHING]
Nazgûl!
[ROARING]
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover! It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
WOMAN 1:
They're breaking in!
WOMAN 2:
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
GANDALF:
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn.
[HORN BLOWS]
Forth Eorlingas!
[BATTLE CRIES]
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim! To the king!
Yes!
[GRUNTS]
[ENTS ROARING]
TREEBEARD:
A hit.
A fine hit.
[TREEBEARD GRUNTS]
TREEBEARD:
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
[RUMBLING]
[ROARING]
[YELLS]
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
[PANTING]
[SWORD CLANGS]
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
SAM:
But in the end, it's only a passing thing this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
[HOOVES BEATING] Keep away from the trees!
[SCREAMING AND YELLING]
Final count...
-...42.
-Forty-two?
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
-Forty-three.
-He was already dead.
-He was twitching.
-He was twitching because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
MERRY:
He doesn't look happy, does he?
PIPPIN:
Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.
-The world's back to normal, that's all.
-No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
-It is!
-Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
[HOBBITS LAUGHING]
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
-Is that its name?
-No.
No!
-Yes.
-Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
-You cannot go that way.
SMÉAGOL:
It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
SAM:
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
-Forgive and forget.
-No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Nice master.
-Nice Hobbits.
SAM:
Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
[RUMBLING]
GANDALF:
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
FRODO:
Sméagol?
SAM:
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
GOLLUM:
Master broke his promise.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
SAM:
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
-Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
FRODO:
Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Shh.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
[THUNDER RUMBLING]

- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before... haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears... to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on... on the precious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes... on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down!
I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard... and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman... and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron... we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear... and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Eothain!
Eothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord... is ready to fall.
Theodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Eomer, over here!
He's alive.
Theodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent... your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan... and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further... until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper... talk to each other... even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful... a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan... what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf... if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king... and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say... as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle... into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side... because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are... and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us... it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones... and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Smeagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Smeagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory... and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire... and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me... and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead... and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back... until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now... at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here... in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?
I mean, charming... quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones... that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses... and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest... near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dur, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Numenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge... for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning... we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it... has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor... in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed... and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Smeagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path... and some stairs.
And then... a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Smeagol.
Good Smeagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then... you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan... whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son... he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king... to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness... in the bitter watches of the night... when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring... still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
Theoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour... in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Theoden... son of Thengel... too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you... from the spell.
You have no power here...
Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Theoden dies.
You did not kill me... you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Eowyn.
Eowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
I've only... ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Theoden King!
Where is Theodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmyn?
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live... to see the last days of my house.
Theodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Eomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Eomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me... but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king... the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves... but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell... for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings... a shield maiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep... the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him... what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now... and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Smeagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Smeagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will... behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw... and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Smeagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is... where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance... that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief... that there are no Dwarf women... and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground... which is, of course, ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
- It's good.
- Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Theoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dunedain.
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen...
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
- What is it?
What do you see?
- Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
- I can fight.
- No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
- Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!
- That's it!
Go on!
- Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
- Mama!
- Eothain!
Freda!
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Theoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn... where is he?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock... but for a small culvert at its base... which is little more than a drain.
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning... thousands, to storm the Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night... the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising... from Isengard these days.
Isengard?
There was a time... when Saruman would walk in my woods.
But now he has a mind of metal... and wheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king... and all that you hope for comes true... you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
Aragorn will die.
And there will be no comfort for you... no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death... an image of the splendor of the kings of Men... in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter... you will linger on in darkness and in doubt... as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell... bound to your grief under the fading trees... until all the world is changed... and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here... only death.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman... to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor... the last free kingdom of Men.
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand... the quest will claim his life.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand... take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth... even unto to the ending of the world.
The time of the Elves... is over.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
- How many?
- Some thousands.
More come every day.
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria... two were my kin... a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...
I know his uses, and they are few.
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...
- send me in his stead.
- You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please... let me go down to him.
Smeagol.
Master is here.
Come, Smeagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Smeagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Smeagol.
Nice Smeagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Smeagol, don't struggle.
Smeagol, listen to me.
Master!
Why does it cry, Smeagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but...
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on... he'll find me.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo...
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you... two Halflings... and a host of men at my call.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor... to show his quality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
- He's alive!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest... and the most reckless man I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms... to be ready for battle by nightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall... or set foot inside the Hornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown... homes rebuilt.
Within these walls... we will outlast them.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people... down to the last child.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end... as to be worthy of remembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon...?
No, my Lord Aragorn... we are alone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions...
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled... about the wars of Men and wizards... for a very long time.
But now, something is about to happen... that has not happened... for an age.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents... will go to war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord... will follow you to whatever end.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West... behind the hills... into Shadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying... good morning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Hama... there is always hope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 17!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot... and we have agreed... you are not Orcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit... it takes a long time... to say anything in Old Entish... and we never say anything... unless it is worth taking... a long time to say.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread... and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And...
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
- Fall back!
- Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
- Turn around.
Take us south.
- South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then... you are very small.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please... let me go.
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice... that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
Entish or the tongues of Men... for this treachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight... with rock and stone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely... that we go to our doom.
Last march... of the Ents.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgul!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn... look to the east.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand... shall sound in the Deep... one last time.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath... now for ruin and a red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Theoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Eomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy?
How could the world go back to the way it was... when so much bad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you... that meant something.
Even if you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories... had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.
They kept going... because they were holding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
- 42.
- 42?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
- 43.
- He was already dead.
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching... because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir... you have shown your quality, sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee... where gardeners are held in high honor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path... near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
- Is that its name?
- No.
No!
- Yes.
- Frodo... they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits... somewhere in the wilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave."
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave."
Smeagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Smeagol.
Poor, poor Smeagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious... and we be the master!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
- Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
- Smeagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Smeagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No!
Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it!
Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural.
None of it.
-What's in this?
-Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we were having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?
!
You never know.
Sam.
My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elves rope.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
... buttheydid.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More Lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food...
... butthisElvishstuff,it's notbad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
... haven'tyou,Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears...
... toservethemaster of the precious.
We will swear on...
... ontheprecious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes...
... ontheprecious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
-Get down!
I said, down!
-Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says.
Yes!
No!
We won't go back.
Not there.
Not to him.
They can't make us.
Gollum!
Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No.
Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey!
Come back now!
Come back!
There!
What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry?
Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water.
Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
-Leave him alone!
-Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
-You're hurt.
-I'm fine.
-It was just an act.
-An act?
See?
I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...
... andMordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...
... andtheunionofthetwotowers?
Together, my Lord Sauron...
... weshallrulethis Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of Industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
... andtheIronfistsofthe Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
-Burn it.
-Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin In Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord...
... isreadyto fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
-Mordor will pay for this.
-These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...
... yourwarmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...
... andallitsdomains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further...
... untilwe 'vehadabreather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
... andcomealive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper...
... talktoeachother...
... evenmove.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful...
... abitof theflank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan...
... whatnewsfromthe Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...
... ifitstoodbut alittlehigher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...
... andclaimedlordshipovertheselands .
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say...
... asanoldman hoodedandcloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle...
... intoFangornForest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side...
... becausenobody'son my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
-Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
-No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are...
... andmaybeyouaren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place.
It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished!
Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then.
And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us...
... itneverletsgo.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
... andlightlittlecandles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has falled and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
-I thought they were dead.
-Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
... andanger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire...
... andwater.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
... I foughtwiththe Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy...
... andsmotehis ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me...
... andIstrayedoutofthought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead...
... andeveryday was aslong as a life age of the Earth.
But It was not the end.
I felt life In me again.
I've been sent back...
... untilmy taskisdone .
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now...
... attheturnofthetide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
-We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
-Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes I'll with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...
... inthishorrid,dark,dank tree-infested--?
I mean, charming...
... quitecharmingforest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones...
... thatstartsan avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
-... andfindthattheyarestrong.
-Strong?
!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas...
... unlessmy eyesare cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses...
... andhasbeenmyfriend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer's day
Upon your head How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
-Is it much further?
-Bru-ra-hroom.
Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest...
... neartherootsofthemountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is In the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge...
... forRohanis weakand readytofall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning...
... wehaveoneadvantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it...
... hasnotyet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor...
... inthehandsofa Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed...
... andthesecrecyofhisquest .
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed?
Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
-I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elves cloaks will hide us in there.
-Now!
-No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path...
... andsomestairs.
And then...
... atunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then...
... youweresick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something...
Treeish.
No, I didn't.
I was just stretching.
You're taller.
-Who?
-You!
-Than what?
-Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what?
Three-foot-six?
At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
3'8"!
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't!
Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
-I want some!
-It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back.
Merry!
What's happening?
!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth.
Dig deep.
Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
-Are there Ent children?
-Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
-Why is that?
-We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
-How did they die?
-Die?
No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...
... whosemindisoverthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son...
... heis dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king...
... tolosehisonlysonandheir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
... inthebitterwatchesofthenight...
... whenallyourlifeseemstoshrink .
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring...
... stillclingingto winter'schill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
... ThéodenKing.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
... GandalfStormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour...
... inwhichthisconjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
I'll news is an I'll guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death...
... tobandycrookedwords with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden...
... sonofThéngel...
... toolonghaveyou sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you...
... fromthespell.
You have no power here...
... GandalftheGrey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me...
... youwillnotkillhim.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
... iftheygraspedyoursword.
I've only...
... everservedyou,mylord .
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live...
... toseethelastdays ofmy house .
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me...
... butI willnotbringfurtherdeath to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
... Théoden,notAragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king...
... thecitymustempty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do.
Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
I have heard of the magic of Elves...
... butI didnotlookforit in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell...
... fora time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
-... washefromGondor?
-No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers, I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings...
... ashieldmaidenof Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep...
... thegreatfortressofRohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
-Why do you do that?
-What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him...
... whatit'sstilldoingtohim.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
-You have to fight it.
-I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now...
... andnevercomeback.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will...
... behavinglikethat.
There's only one way to eat a brace of boneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw...
... andwriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphant.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait!
We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is...
... wherehecamefrom.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there...
... inpeace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance...
... thatthey'reoftenmistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...
... thattherearenoDwarfwomen ...
... andthatDwarvesjustspringout of holes in the ground...
... whichis,of course,ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.
Cut down by Orcs.
She watched her mother succumb to grief.
Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear.
Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
Gimli.
No, I couldn't
I really couldn't.
I made some stew.
It isn't much, but it's hot.
Thank you.
-It's good.
-Really?
My uncle told me a strange thing.
He said that you rode to war with Théngel, my grandfather.
But he must be mistaken.
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.
Then you must be at least 60.
Seventy?
But you cannot be 80!
Eighty-seven.
You are one of the Dûnedain.
A descendant of Nûmenor, blessed with long life.
It was said that your race had passed into legend.
There are few of us left.
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
I'm sorry.
Please, eat.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom I will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
Arwen... .
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
I don't believe you.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
-Háma?
-I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
-What is it?
What do you see?
-Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
-I can fight.
-No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
-Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!
-That's it!
Go on!
-Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's...
... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
-Mama!
-Éothain!
Freda!
-Where is the rest?
-This is all we could save, my lady.
Take it to the caves.
Make way for the king.
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn...
... whereishe ?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock...
... butforasmallculvert at its base...
... whichis littlemorethan adrain .
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning...
... thousands,tostormthe Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
It's victory is at hand.
This night...
... thelandwillbestained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising...
... fromIsengardthesedays.
Isengard?
There was a time...
... whenSarumanwouldwalkinmy woods .
But now he has a mind of metal...
... andwheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Brego.
Arwen.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...
... andallthatyou hopefor comes true...
... youwillstillhavetotaste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
... Aragornwilldie.
And there will be no comfort for you...
... nocomforttoease thepain of his passing.
He will come to death...
... anImageofthesplendor of the kings of Men...
... Ingloryundimmedbefore the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter...
... youwilllingeronindarkness and in doubt...
... asnightfallinwinter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell...
... boundto yourgrief under the fading trees...
... untilallthe worldischanged...
... andthelongyearsofyourlife are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here...
... onlydeath.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...
... todestroythe peopleofRohan .
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...
... thelastfreekingdomofMen .
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring Is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer Is failing.
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...
... thequestwillclaimhislife.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
It is the risk we all took.
In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
It works hard now to find its way back Into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...
... taketheRingforhisown, and the world will fall.
It is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth...
... evenuntototheending of the world.
The time of the Elves...
... Isover.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
-How many?
-Some thousands.
More come every day.
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from Isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria...
... twoweremy kin...
... aDwarftherewas also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.
If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past.
It was cloven in two.
But more than this, I know it in my heart.
He was my brother.
Boromir!
Boromir!
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.
A place of light and beauty and music.
And so it shall be once more!
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
-For Gondor!
Good speech.
Nice and short.
Leaves more time for drinking!
Break out the ale!
These men are thirsty!
Remember today, little brother.
Today, life is good.
What?
He's here.
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?
Where is he?
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?
Father!
They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.
Were you not entrusted to protect it?
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
Oh, too few.
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
That is not my intent.
You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will.
-He loves you, Father.
-Do not trouble me with Faramir...
... I knowhisuses,andtheyarefew .
We have more urgent things to speak of.
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.
It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
The One Ring.
-Isildur's Bane.
-It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.
-Gondor.
-It's dangerous, I know.
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.
It is our blood, which is being spilled, our people who are dying.
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.
He will return.
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.
You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
No.
My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.
-Would you deny your own father?
-If there is need to go to Rivendell...
-... sendmein hisstead.
-You?
Oh, I see.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
I think not.
I trust this mission only to your brother.
The one who will not fail me.
Remember today, little brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall I shoot?
The rock and pool Is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And I to him.
He is our guide.
Please...
... letmego downtohim.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
That's enough.
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
I told you he was tricksy.
I told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
I can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but... .
I'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
If I put it on...
... he'llfindme.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo... .
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild I have you...
... twoHalflings...
... anda hostof menatmycall.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor...
... toshowhisquality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please.
It's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
-He's alive!
-Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest...
... andthemostrecklessman I ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
-All Isengard is emptied.
-How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
It is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...
... tobereadyfor battlebynightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...
... orsetfootinsidetheHornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown...
... homesrebuilt.
Within these walls...
... wewilloutlastthem.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people...
... downtothelastchild.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end...
... astobe worthyofremembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon--?
No, my Lord Aragorn...
... wearealone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions--
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled...
... aboutthewarsofMenandwizards...
... fora verylongtime.
But now, something is about to happen...
... thathasnothappened...
... foranage.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents...
... willgoto war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
Come on, people!
Quickly, now!
We'll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above the gate.
Aragorn, you must rest.
You're no use to us half alive.
Aragorn!
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
That is an honorable charge.
To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return.
What renown is there in that?
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
-Let me stand at your side.
-It is not in my power to command it.
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you.
Because they love you.
I'm sorry.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
I can see it in their eyes.
Then I shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am I, Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord...
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West...
... behindthehills...
... IntoShadow.
How did it come to this?
It's been going for hours.
They must have decided something by now.
Decided?
No.
We only just finished saying...
... goodmorning.
But it's nighttime already.
You can't take forever.
Don't be hasty.
We're running out of time!
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma...
... thereisalwayshope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
I was wrong to despair.
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.
It's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
-What's happening out there?
-Shall I describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
So it begins.
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
-Fire!
-Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
I'm on 1 7!
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
I have told your names to the Entmoot...
... andwehaveagreed...
... youarenotOrcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
It affects us all.
Tree, root and twig.
But you must understand, young Hobbit...
... ittakesalongtime ...
... tosayanythinginOldEntish...
... andweneversay anything...
... unlessit is worthtaking...
... alongtimetosay.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
Is this it?
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
It's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of Isengard will spread...
... andthewoodsofTuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And... .
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
Haldir!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
It's a long way.
Toss me.
-What?
-I cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
-Fall back!
-Retreat!
Hurry!
Inside.
Get them inside!
Into the Keep!
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
-Turn around.
Take us south.
-South?
But that will lead you past Isengard.
Yes.
Exactly.
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
It's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then...
... youareverysmall.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
I always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
Osgiliath burns!
Mordor has come.
The Ring will not save Gondor.
It has only the power to destroy.
Please...
... letmego .
Hurry.
Faramir!
You must let me go!
And those little family of field mice...
... thatclimbup sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.
They're always trying to get somewhere where they... .
Many of these trees were my friends.
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
I'm sorry, Treebeard.
They had voices of their own.
Saruman.
A wizard should know better!
There is no curse in Elvish...
... Entishor thetonguesofMen...
... forthistreachery.
Look!
The trees!
They're moving!
Where are they going?
They have business with the Orcs.
My business is with Isengard tonight...
... withrockandstone.
Yes.
Come, my friends.
The Ents are going to war.
It is likely...
... thatwego to ourdoom.
Last march...
... oftheEnts.
Faramir!
Orcs have taken the eastern shore.
Their numbers are too great.
By nightfall we will be overrun.
Mr. Frodo?
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.
Take them to my father.
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?
You want to know why your brother died?
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him!
He tried to kill him!
The Ring drove your brother mad!
Watch out!
Mr. Frodo?
They're here.
They've come.
Nazgûl!
Stay here.
Keep out of sight.
Take cover!
The fortress is taken.
It is over.
You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.
They're breaking in!
They're past the door!
Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
Is there no other way?
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.
Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass.
-And barricade the entrance!
-So much death.
What can Men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
Ride out and meet them.
For death and glory.
For Rohan.
For your people.
The sun is rising.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn...
... lookto theeast.
Yes.
Yes.
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...
... shallsoundin theDeep...
... onelasttime.
Yes!
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
Fell deeds, awake.
Now for wrath...
... nowforruinanda red dawn.
Forth Eorlingas!
Gandalf.
Théoden King stands alone.
Not alone.
Rohirrim!
Éomer.
To the king!
Yes!
A hit.
A fine hit.
Break the dam!
Release the river!
Pippin!
Hold on!
Hold on, little Hobbits.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
It's me.
It's your Sam.
Don't you know your Sam?
I can't do this, Sam.
I know.
It's all wrong.
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.
But we are.
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...
... becausehowcouldthe end behappy?
How could the world go back to the way it was...
... whenso muchbad had happened?
Victory!
We have victory!
But in the end, It's only a passing thing...
... thisshadow.
Even darkness must pass.
A new day will come.
And when the sun shines, It will shine out the clearer.
Those were the stories that stayed with you...
... thatmeantsomething.
Even If you were too small to understand why.
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
Folk in those stories...
... hadlotsofchancesofturningback, only they didn't.
They kept going...
... becausetheywereholding on to something.
What are we holding on to, Sam?
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.
And it's worth fighting for.
I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father.
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
Then it is forfeit.
Release them.
Stay out of the forest!
Keep away from the trees!
Final count...
-... 42.
-Forty-two?
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.
-Forty-three.
-He was already dead.
-He was twitching.
-He was twitching...
... becausehe'sgotmyax embedded in his nervous system!
-He doesn't look too happy, does he?
-Not too happy at all, Merry.
Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.
Oh, yes.
It's a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.
-The world is back to normal, that's all.
-No, it isn't.
I'm starving.
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.
Saruman's storeroom!
I don't believe it.
It can't be.
-It is!
-Longbottom Leaf.
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
It's perfect.
One barrel each.
Wait.
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
Share it?
No.
No.
Dead plant and all that.
Don't think he'd understand.
Could be a distant relative.
I get it.
Don't be hasty.
Exactly.
Bar-hrum.
This is the old sewer.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
You'll find cover in the woods there.
Captain Faramir...
... youhaveshownyourquality,sir.
The very highest.
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...
... wheregardenersareheldinhighhonor.
What road will you take once you reach the woods?
Gollum says there's a path...
... nearMinasMorgul that climbs up into the mountains.
Cirith Ungol?
-Is that its name?
-No.
No!
-Yes.
-Frodo...
... theysayadarkterrordwells in the passes above Minas Morgul.
-You cannot go that way.
-It is the only way.
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
I must.
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.
Thank you.
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
Come on, keep up.
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.
You know that, don't you?
He was trying to save you, see?
Save me?
So there's no hard feelings.
-Forgive and forget.
-No, no, no hard feelings.
Gollum, Gollum.
Yes, master.
-Nice Hobbits.
-Very decent of you.
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...
... somewherein thewilderness.
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
What?
I wonder if people will ever say, "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."
And they'll say, "Yes!
That's one of my favorite stories."
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"
"Yes, my boy.
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot"
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:
"Samwise the Brave"
I want to hear more about Sam.
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.
So was I.
"Samwise the Brave"
Sméagol?
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.
Master.
Master looks after us.
Master wouldn't hurt us.
Master broke his promise.
Don't ask Sméagol.
Poor, poor Sméagol.
Master betrayed us.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill them both!
And then we take the precious...
... andwebe themaster!
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.
Eyes always watching.
Then we stabs them out.
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Kill them both.
Yes.
No!
No!
It's too risky.
It's too risky.
Where is he?
Where has he gone?
-Hey, Gollum!
Where are you?
-Sméagol?
We could let her do it.
Yes.
She could do it.
Yes, precious, she could.
And then we takes it once they're dead.
Once they're dead.
Come on, Hobbits.
Long ways to go yet.
Sméagol will show you the way.
Follow me.
-You cannot pass!
-Gandalf!
i am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No!
No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Mordor.
The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandaif meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
... buttheydid.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
-What food have we got left?
-Let me see.
Oh, yes.
Lovely.
Lembas bread.
And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food...
... butthisElvishstuff,it's notbad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
-Can you smell it?
-Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves.
The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
... haven'tyou,Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
-Take it off us!
-Quiet, you!
It's hopeless.
Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
-Let's just tie him up and leave him.
-No!
That would kill us!
Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears...
... toservethemaster of the precious.
We will swear on...
... ontheprecious.
Gollum.
Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
We will hold you to your word.
Yes...
... ontheprecious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
-Get down!
I said, down!
-Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
-You know the way to Mordor?
-Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
Merry!
Merry!
What is it?
What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
Aragorn.
They've picked up our trail.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food.
No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us.
Come.
Come, Gimli!
We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas!
What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world Is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...
... andMordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...
... andtheunionofthetwotowers?
Together, my Lord Sauron...
... weshallrulethis Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn In the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
... andtheironfistsofthe Orc.
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain!
Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me.
You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord...
... Isreadyto fall.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Gríma.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked.
Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...
... yourwarmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...
... underpainofdeath.
Keep breathing.
That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further...
... untilwe 'vehadabreather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
... andcomealive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper...
... talktoeachother...
... evenmove.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?
!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
-They look tasty.
-Get back, scum!
-Carve them up!
-Just a mouthful.
No!
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan...
... whatnewsfromthe Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...
... ifitstoodbut alittlehigher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...
... andclaimedlordshipovertheselands .
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say...
... asanoldman hoodedandcloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel!
Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle...
... intoFangornForest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him?
I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees.
Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side...
... becausenobody'son my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs!
We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
-Destroyers and usurpers!
Curse them!
-No!
You don't understand.
We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are...
... andmaybeyouaren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See?
See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses.
Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog.
He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master.
We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits!
Come!
We go quickly.
I found it.
I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead.
All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes.
Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now!
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
... andlightlittlecandles of their own.
Frodo!
-Gollum?
-Don't follow the lights.
-Gollum!
-Mr.
Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
-Who are you?
-Mustn't ask us.
Not its business.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide!
Hide!
Come on, Frodo.
Come on!
Quick!
They will see us!
They will see us!
-I thought they were dead.
-Dead?
No, you cannot kill them.
No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo!
It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
... andanger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
You fell.
Through fire...
... andwater.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
... I foughtwiththe Balrog of Morgoth.
Until at last I threw down my enemy...
... andsmotehis ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me...
... andistrayedoutofthought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead...
... andeveryday was aslong as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back...
... untilmy taskisdone .
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And i come back to you now...
... attheturnofthetide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
That is one of the Mearas...
... unlessmy eyesare cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses...
... andhasbeenmyfriend through many dangers.
My home lies deep in the forest...
... neartherootsofthemountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
-I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
-I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
-Now!
-No!
No!
No, master!
They catch you!
They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No!
There's another way.
More secret.
A dark way.
-Why haven't you spoken of this before?
-Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes.
There's a path...
... andsomestairs.
And then...
... atunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...
... whosemindisoverthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son...
... heis dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king...
... tolosehisonlysonandheir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
... inthebitterwatchesofthenight...
... whenallyourlifeseemstoshrink .
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring...
... stillclingingto winter'schill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
... ThéodenKing.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
... GandalfStormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour...
... inwhichthisconjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent.
Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death...
... tobandycrookedwords with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden...
... sonofThengel...
... toolonghaveyou sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you...
... fromthespell.
You have no power here...
... GandalftheGrey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me...
... youwillnotkillhim.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
... iftheygraspedyoursword.
I've only...
... everservedyou,mylord .
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord!
No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live...
... toseethelastdays ofmy house .
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me...
... butI willnotbringfurtherdeath to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
... Théoden,notAragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king...
... thecitymustempty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings...
... ashieldmaidenof Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable.
He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep...
... thegreatfortressofRohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
-Why do you do that?
-What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him...
... whatit'sstilldoingtohim.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam.
I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating.
You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
-You have to fight it.
-I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine!
My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked.
Tricksy.
False.
No.
Not master.
Yes, precious.
False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening.
I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum.
Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me.
We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now...
... andnevercomeback.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone!
Gone!
Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look.
See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender.
They are nice.
Yes, they are.
Eat them.
Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will...
... behavinglikethat.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin?
There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters?
Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw...
... andwriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
-Who are they?
-Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
-Ready to do what?
-To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving.
Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Bind their hands.
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance...
... thatthey'reoftenmistaken for Dwarf men.
It's the beards.
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...
... thattherearenoDwarfwomen ...
... andthatDwarvesjustspringout of holes in the ground...
... whichis,of course,ridiculous.
It's all right.
Nobody panic.
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.
It is mine to give to whom i will.
Like my heart.
Go to sleep.
I am asleep.
This is a dream.
Then it is a good dream.
Sleep.
You told me once...
this day would come.
This is not the end... itisthebeginning.
You must go with Frodo.
That is your path.
My path is hidden from me.
It is already laid before your feet.
You cannot falter now.
Arwen... .
If you trust nothing else...
trust this...
... trustus.
Where is she?
The woman who gave you that jewel.
Our time here is ending.
Arwen's time is ending.
Let her go.
Let her take the ship into the west.
Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands.
There it will be ever green.
But never more than memory.
I will not leave my daughter here to die.
-She stays because she still has hope.
-She stays for you.
She belongs with her people.
You have a chance for another life...
away from war... grief...despair.
Why are you saying this?
I am mortal.
You are Elf-kind.
It was a dream, Arwen.
Nothing more.
This belongs to you.
It was a gift.
Keep it.
My lord?
She is sailing to the Undying Lands with all that is left of her kin.
What is it?
-Háma?
-I'm not sure.
Wargs!
A scout!
-What is it?
What do you see?
-Warg!
We're under attack!
Get them out of here!
All riders to the head of the column.
Come on.
Get me up here.
I'm a rider.
Come on!
You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste.
-I can fight.
-No!
You must do this, for me.
Follow me!
-Forward.
I mean, charge forward.
-Make for the lower ground!
-That's it!
Go on!
-Stay together!
Bring your pretty face to my ax.
That one counts as mine!
Stinking creature.
Aragorn!
Aragorn?
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
He's...
... dead.
He took a little tumble off the cliff.
You lie.
Get the wounded on horses.
The wolves of Isengard will return.
Leave the dead.
Come.
-At last!
-Helm's Deep.
There it is, Helm's Deep.
We're safe!
We're safe, my lady.
Thank you.
-Mama!
-Éothain!
Freda!
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.
So few.
So few of you have returned.
Our people are safe.
We have paid for it with many lives.
My lady.
Lord Aragorn...
... whereishe ?
He fell.
Draw all our forces behind the wall.
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?
Get them into the caves.
Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
Helm 's Deep has one weakness.
Its outer wall is solid rock...
... butforasmallculvert at its base...
... whichis littlemorethan adrain .
How?
How can fire undo stone?
What kind of device could bring down the wall?
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning...
... thousands,tostormthe Keep.
Tens of thousands.
But, my lord, there is no such force.
A new power is rising.
Its victory is at hand.
This night...
... thelandwillbestained with the blood of Rohan!
March to Helm's Deep!
Leave none alive!
To war!
There will be no dawn for Men.
Look.
There's smoke to the south.
There is always smoke rising...
... fromIsengardthesedays.
Isengard?
There was a time...
... whenSarumanwouldwalkinmy woods .
But now he has a mind of metal...
... andwheels.
He no longer cares for growing things.
What is it?
It's Saruman's army.
The war has started.
May the grace of the Valar protect you.
Arwen.
It is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... beforeitis toolate.
I have made my choice.
He is not coming back.
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
There is still hope.
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...
... andallthatyou hopefor comes true...
... youwillstillhavetotaste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...
... Aragornwilldie.
And there will be no comfort for you...
... nocomforttoease thepain of his passing.
He will come to death...
... animageofthesplendor of the kings of Men...
... ingloryundimmedbefore the breaking of the world.
But you, my daughter...
... youwilllingeronindarkness and in doubt...
... asnightfallinwinter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell...
... boundto yourgrief under the fading trees...
... untilallthe worldischanged...
... andthelongyearsofyourlife are utterly spent.
Arwen.
There is nothing for you here...
... onlydeath.
Do i not also have your love?
You have my love, father.
The power of the enemy is growing.
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...
... todestroythe peopleofRohan .
Isengard has been unleashed.
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...
... thelastfreekingdomofMen .
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close.
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.
in his heart, Frodo begins to understand...
... thequestwillclaimhislife.
You know this.
You have foreseen it.
it is the risk we all took.
in the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong.
it works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men.
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand...
... taketheRingforhisown, and the world will fall.
it is close now.
So close to achieving its goal.
For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth...
... evenuntototheending of the world.
The time of the Elves...
... isover.
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?
What news?
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.
Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.
Sauron is marshaling an army.
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.
-How many?
-Some thousands.
More come every day.
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.
if their city is attacked, we won't hold it.
Saruman attacks from isengard.
Sauron from Mordor.
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak.
Sauron will strike us soon.
And he will strike hard.
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
Spies?
Now wait just a minute.
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?
Speak.
We are Hobbits of the Shire.
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.
Your bodyguard?
His gardener.
And where is your skulking friend?
That gangrel creature.
He had an ill-favored look.
There was no other.
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.
One we lost in Moria...
... twoweremy kin...
... aDwarftherewas also.
And an Elf and two Men.
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
You're a friend of Boromir?
Yes.
For my part.
it will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
Dead?
How?
When?
As one of his companions, i'd hoped you would tell me.
He was my brother.
Captain Faramir!
We found the third one.
You must come with me.
Now.
Down there.
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
They wait for my command.
Shall i shoot?
The rock and pool is nice and cool
So juicy sweet
Our only wish To catch a fish
So juicy sweet
Wait.
This creature is bound to me.
And i to him.
He is our guide.
Please...
... letmego downtohim.
Sméagol.
Master is here.
Come, Sméagol.
Trust master.
Come.
We must go now?
Sméagol, you must trust master.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come.
Come, Sméagol.
Nice Sméagol.
That's it.
Come on.
Don't hurt him!
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.
Master!
No!
No!
Where are you leading them?
Answer me.
Sméagol.
Why does it cry, Sméagol?
Cruel Men hurts us.
Master tricksed us.
Of course he did.
i told you he was tricksy.
i told you he was false.
Master is our friend.
Our friend.
Master betrayed us.
No.
Not its business.
Leave us alone!
Filthy little Hobbitses!
They stole it from us!
No.
No.
What did they steal?
My precious!
We have to get out of here.
You go.
Go, now.
You can do it.
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.
Just this once.
Put it on.
Disappear.
i can't.
You were right, Sam.
You tried to tell me but... .
i'm sorry.
The Ring's taking me, Sam.
if i put it on...
... he'llfindme.
He'll see.
Mr. Frodo... .
So this is the answer to all the riddles.
Here in the Wild i have you...
... twoHalflings...
... anda hostof menatmycall.
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...
... toshowhisquality.
No!
Stop it!
Leave him alone.
Don't you understand?
He's got to destroy it!
That's where we're going, into Mordor.
To the Mountain of Fire!
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.
Please. it's such a burden.
Will you not help him?
Captain?
Prepare to leave.
The Ring will go to Gondor.
-He's alive!
-Where is he?
Where is he?
Get out of the way!
i'm going to kill him!
You are the luckiest, the canniest...
... andthemostrecklessman i ever knew.
Bless you, laddie.
Gimli, where is the king?
You're late.
You look terrible.
A great host, you say?
-All isengard is emptied.
-How many?
Ten thousand strong at least.
Ten thousand?
it is an army bred for a single purpose:
To destroy the world of Men.
They will be here by nightfall.
Let them come!
i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...
... tobereadyfor battlebynightfall.
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...
... orsetfootinsidetheHornburg!
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai.
Their armour is thick and their shields broad.
i have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
i know how to defend my own keep.
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.
Crops can be resown...
... homesrebuilt.
Within these walls...
... wewilloutlastthem.
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.
They come to destroy its people...
... downtothelastchild.
What would you have me do?
Look at my men.
Their courage hangs by a thread.
if this is to be our end, then i would have them make such an end...
... astobe worthyofremembrance.
Send out riders, my lord.
You must call for aid.
And who will come?
Elves?
Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead.
-Gondor will answer.
-Gondor?
!
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?
!
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?
!
Where was Gon--?
No, my Lord Aragorn...
... wearealone.
Get the women and children into the caves.
We need more time to lay provisions--
There is no time.
War is upon us.
Secure the gate.
We Ents have not troubled...
... aboutthewarsofMenandwizards...
... fora verylongtime.
But now, something is about to happen...
... thathasnothappened...
... foranage.
Entmoot.
What's that?
'Tis a gathering.
A gathering of what?
Beech.
Oak.
Chestnut.
Ash.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Many have come.
Now we must decide if the Ents...
... willgoto war.
Move back!
Move to the caves!
-Keep moving.
-Quickly now.
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
These are no soldiers.
-Most have seen too many winters.
-Or too few.
Look at them.
They're frightened.
You can see it in their eyes.
And they should be...
Three hundred...
against ten thousand!
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras...
They cannot win this fight.
They are all going to die!
Then i shall die as one of them!
Let him go, lad.
Let him be.
Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armoury.
My lord?
Who am i , Gamling?
You are our king, sire.
And do you trust your king?
Your men, my lord...
... willfollowyoutowhateverend.
To whatever end.
Where is the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
They have passed like rain on the mountains.
Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the West...
... behindthehills...
... intoShadow.
How did it come to this?
Move!
Move to the outer wall.
Give me your sword.
What is your name?
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
The men are saying we will not live out the night.
They say that it is hopeless.
This is a good sword.
Haleth, son of Háma...
... thereisalwayshope.
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.
Forgive me.
i was wrong to despair.
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
We had time, i'd get this adjusted.
it's a little tight across the chest.
That is no Orc horn.
Send for the king.
-Open the gate!
-Open up the gate!
How is this possible?
i bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.
Long ago we fought and died together.
We come to honor that allegiance.
You are most welcome.
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.
You could have picked a better spot.
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
Let's hope they last the night.
Show them no mercy...
for you shall receive none!
-What's happening out there?
-Shall i describe it to you?
Or would you like me to find you a box?
HOLD!
So it begins.
Prepare to fire!
Their armour is weak at the neck...
and beneath the arm.
Release Arrows!
Did they hit anything?
Give them a volley.
-Fire!
-Fire!
Send them to me!
Come on!
Ladders!
Good!
Swords!
Swords!
Legolas!
Two already!
i'm on 1 7!
i'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
Nineteen!
Merry.
We have just agreed.
Yes?
i have told your names to the Entmoot...
... andwehaveagreed...
... youarenotOrcs.
Well, that's good news.
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
Hasty?
Our friends are out there.
They need our help.
They cannot fight this war on their own.
War?
Yes.
it affects us all.
But you must understand, young Hobbit...
... ittakesalongtime ...
... tosayanythinginOldEntish...
... andweneversay anything...
... unlessit is worthtaking...
... alongtimetosay.
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Causeway!
is this it?
is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?
Bring him down, Legolas!
Kill him!
Kill him!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
Stand firm!
Aragorn!
Gimli!
Charge!
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.
We must weather such things as we have always done.
How can that be your decision?
!
This is not our war.
But you're part of this world!
Aren't you?
!
You must help.
Please.
You must do something.
You are young and brave, Master Merry.
But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
Maybe Treebeard's right.
We don't belong here, Merry.
it's too big for us.
What can we do in the end?
We've got the Shire.
Maybe we should go home.
The fires of isengard will spread...
... andthewoodsofTuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And... .
And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
Aragorn!
Fall back to the Keep!
Get your men out of there!
To the Keep!
Pull back to the Keep!
Haldir!
To the Keep!
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?
Haldir!
Brace the gate!
Hold them!
To the gate.
Draw your swords!
Make way!
We cannot hold much longer!
-Hold them!
-How long do you need?
As long as you can give me.
Gimli!
Timbers!
Brace the gate!
Come on.
We can take them.
it's a long way.
Toss me.
-What?
-i cannot jump the distance!
You'll have to toss me!
Don't tell the Elf.
Not a word.
Shore up the door!
-Make way!
-Follow me to the barricade.
Watch our backs!
-Throw another one over here!
-Higher!
Hold fast the gate!
Gimli!
Aragorn!
Get out of there!
Aragorn!
Pull everybody back.
Pull them back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
They have broken through!
The castle is breached.
Retreat!
-Fall back!
-Retreat!
Hurry!
i nside.
Get them inside!
into the Keep!
i will leave you at the western borders of the forest.
You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
Wait!
Stop!
Stop!
Turn around.
-Turn around.
Take us south.
-South?
But that will lead you past isengard.
Yes.
Exactiy.
if we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.
The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.
it's the last thing he'll expect.
That doesn't make sense to me.
But then...
... youareverysmall.
Perhaps you're right.
South it is, then.
Hold on, little Shirelings.
i always like going south.
Somehow it feels like going downhill.
Are you mad?
We'll be caught.
No, we won't.
Not this time.
Look!
