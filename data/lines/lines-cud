Figured I could sow some dissention and get a few ties and sweaters.
What happens when they find out?
It's secret santa.
And what happens when they find out?
They'll argue about what to do with that information.
The ties are less important than the dissention.
- We still have to buy him something.
- Not a chance.
We weren't supposed to discuss this.
We're not supposed to know.
He's not supposed to put his name in there five times.
He wants presents.
It's sad.
It's pathetic.
I'm still buying him a present.
No, you're not.
Fine!
What's wrong?
I think it's getting worse.
I can't breathe.
I need a nurse in here!
The lymph nodes are cutting off her airway.
We've got to intubate!
The swollen lymph nodes were cutting off Maggie's airway.
We shrunk 'em with alcohol.
She's breathing on her own now.
That sucks.
4,300 saved emails, and not a single mention of "lesbionic," "sanchez,"
or "man-gina."
Swollen lymph nodes means it wasn't psychological.
Who's that from?
Santa, obviously.
'cause you know I worship him.
No, wait, I mean Satan.
I always get 'em confused.
What is an alpine butterfly?
And why is she learning how to do one?
We already have a full history.
- Need to waste time
- It's just a climbing knot.
But what does she use it for?
Try bondage.
I did once.
She just tied me down and whined about how hard it is to be dean of medicine.
Gyms aren't exactly pristine.
Could be a fungal infection.
Seriously who's it from?
No fever, no elevated white count.
That's funny.
Her friend sent her a Garfield cartoon.
That cat sure does love lasagna.
House!
Stop obsessing.
If it weren't for my obsessions, you wouldn't know that she has sarcoidosis.
18 months ago she sold her stairmaster.
It was only two months old.
Now, eithershe needed the cash, was getting more difficult.
12 months ago, she canceled a hiking trip.
Now, either she just wanted to sit home and watch Tv, or walking was getting more difficult.
She's been suffering joint pain for the last two years.
Pull my Ribbon, if you know what I mean.
A.c.e. Levels are too low for sarcoidosis.
That's not what I meant.
- Could just be an inactive phase.
- It's not Christmas yet.
I remembered I'm not a satanist, i'm a druid.
- No lung involvement.
- Yet.
We'll need a bronchoalveolar lavage to confirm it.
That's a Shame.
I was gonna surprise her with one for Christmas.
Wow!
Now, either that cost more than 25 bucks or I'm seriously starting to doubt
Steve jobs' business strategies.
Thanks!
Last round of Saline, Maggie.
One more big breath.
We've gotta get the liquid to go all the way into your lungs, okay?
Here we go.
The gift could be from a patient.
Who sent it to the wrong doctor?
House obviously gave the present to himself.
They're arguing right now.
I've been looking for this all morning.
Did you look in the box on my desk?
By the way, your mom called.
Your dad's dead.
You left the present sitting on your desk?
It wouldn't have been as effective sitting in a closet in my home.
They gonna know from you.
No, they're gonna guess that it was from me.
Might even be 90% sure that it was from me, but all that means is they're 10% sure that one of the other guys is screwing them over.
Have you ever considered channeling your powers to,
I don't know, bring peace to the mid-east?
I couldn't do that.
But if they ever got it, you could screw it up?
Yeah, that's more where my powers lie.
- Gift could be from Wilson.
- It's House.
Why do you have a problem with him speculating?
Because that's what House wants us to do.
Lungs are pristine.
No infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.
Maggie, I'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?
A little harder.
Great.
Maggie,
Open your eyes.
Why aren't you saying anything?
What's wrong?
Maggie tested negative for sarcoidosis.
But she's bleeding into her eyes now.
Have her platelets dropped?
Plummeted.
New labs show they under 40.
She bleed out of every orifice don't find the cause.
Could be splenic sequestration, tuberculosis...
Gaucher disease, TTP.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome, sepsis.
Listing all the possible causes is only impressive if you can do it reverse-alphabetically.
We need to know why her platelet machine is broken.
Go to the factory.
Do a bone marrow aspiration.
I'm your secret Santa.
You're not supposed to tell.
But you got a present already.
Which means you have more than one secret Santa.
Or somebody else wants to make me happy.
Merry Christmas.
On one hand, you should be in bed.
And on the other hand, I told you to rest.
So I see your Dilemma.
I don't think resting is the problem.
Can strep cause this?
Clap on...
Trust me, first place I went.
No rash on my labia.
Do you need to take a look?
I'm saving my money for a red ryder BB gun.
Darker Shade of lipstick?
I'm not wearing any.
You tell your mother what you do?
It doesn't matter.
I'm curious.
I don't need to break her heart just so I can feel righteous.
Do you do a Donkey show?
I'm not curious.
It matters.
It's a Donkey or a Mule.
I can never remember.
Wow...
That is a creepy smile.
I bet the Donkey's is even creepier.
- Do I have to explain?
- Nope.
That's my job.
Contagious ecthyma.
Any contact can cause rashes, flu symptoms, sore throat.
Has there been...
Contact?
Okay, antibiotic cream for you, and a love glove for Francis.
You'll both be fine.
You should come see the show.
I think you'd like it.
Sorry, I hate Westerns.
So they really never lie?
Doesn't seem like it.
Admirable.
- You tell Cameron everything?
- No.
You think she keeps secrets?
If I knew, they wouldn't be secrets.
I hope she does.
People have a right to a little privacy, even from the people they love.
You buy House a present?
Why would i?
To screw with me.
Then I'm gonna say yes.
Wait, stop, stop.
What's that smell?
The bone is smoking.
Her Bones are harder than the drill?
We ran a full-body Bones scan to find the cause of hardening in the hip.
No hot spots anywhere.
Tracer could have been inactive.
So I screwed up the test?
There are so many ways that could happened.
Maybe it was inactive.
It didn't fully circulate.
- It circulated the camera picked up.
- Hey, hey, It's Christmas.
Why are you guys fighting?
Why do you think there are no hot spots?
I did not screw up.
The density's consistent.
It just means the density was consistent.
It doesn't mean it was cold.
It's possible all she has are hot spots.
It's consistent because her entire skeleton is turning to stone.
Good for an aspiring superhero.
Fatal for a human hoping to make it to kwanzaa.
It's gotta be from a carbonic anhydrase type-ii deficiency.
It has free will.
Doesn't have to be anything it want to be.
I meant, if it's not CA 2...
Well, none of the other causes of osteopetrosis are treatable.
You're right.
It's gotta be.
We'll run her blood and hope that your sunny optimism isn't misplaced.
They accused kutner of screwing up a test
- because they hate him.
- You're surprised?
That's the sort of crap that happens when you mess with people's heads.
One day he will screw up a test.
If they don't accuse him of that because they like him, someone could die.
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere, I just know it hurts you.
CA-2 deficiency's a genetic disorder that scrambles proteins.
If the blood test is positive, you'll need a bone marrow transplant.
Transplant sounds like a euphemism for slim odds.
Slim but not none.
We're gonna need to test jane for a match.
Don't you have donor banks?
Jane is your best bet.
The procedure's perfectly safe.
There's no risk.
No risk!
- Any surgery has.
- Then don't tell me there's no risk.
You gonna tell me there's no pain either?
- The testing will hurt a little.
- I'll be fine.
If she doesn't do this and you don't make it, she's gonna spend the rest of her life blaming herself.
Mom...
Please.
Find someone else.
Let someone else take the risk.
Donor bank turned up a 49-year-old man in Cleveland who's a five out of six HLA match.
First flight out of Cleveland leaves at.
Why is a 49-year-old Cleveland man a closer match than her daughter?
He may not be.
Maggie didn't let us test her.
- Why not?
- Pain, danger, risk of.
The only reason to give multiple reasons is your searching for what the person wants to hear.
House.
You were wrong about sainted mommy.
Don't care.
You can forget the donor bank.
There's no ca-2 deficiency.
Best we can do is make her comfortable.
Is that from taub?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Merry Christmas.
Who's gonna tell the patient she's dying?
I will.
And nobody leaves here until we find out what killed her.
Whatever she has is fatal.
Makes no difference if it's disease number 58 or 907.
You guys mad at me?
Nope.
You had no choice.
Of course I had a choice.
You had no choice once I made my choice.
And now I'm choosing not to be mad at you.
- Why?
- Cause it'll drive House nuts.
You think that'll make your lives better or worse?
I told my mom I don't care what she thinks.
I want you to test my marrow.
I can't be dying.
Sure, you can.
You're wrong.
You don't even know what I have.
What you have is one last Christmas with your daughter.
One last chance to give her a present.
The truth.
It's inexpensive.
Highly valued.
Never have to stand in line to return it the day after Christmas.
What are you talking about?
A mother who's going to die doesn't refuse a donor test because it might hurt.
She refuses when she knows it won't match.
Which tends to happen when mother and daughter aren't mother and daughter.
I can do DNA tests if you'd rather keep lying to me.
I never wanted kids.
I love them, but with my genes.
I knew this woman.
A drug addict.
She got pregnant, didn't want to have an abortion.
But she also didn't want her daughter to ever know who her real mother was.
What she was.
I promised never to tell.
Then a promise to an addict is worth more than a
- promise to your daughter?
- It'd be cruel to tell her.
Right.
She lives a lie, you get to die a hypocrite.
Mom,
The doctors told me what's happening.
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
I promise you.
Doctors can be wrong.
- There's still a chance I can beat.
- Do you really believe that?
I do.
No, mom, you're dying.
Nobody can help you.
It's not going to be okay.
That was cold.
Yeah.
What'd you get for Christmas?
I got a watch, a vintage lP, and a second-edition Conan Doyle.
And if that wasn't bad enough, my patient's dying.
Christmas deaths in a hospital.
There's nothing more depressing.
No one ever wants to go in the patient's room.
Even the Candy Stripers leave them alone.
But I saw something amazing.
Pure truth.
She told her mother that she was dying.
Stripped her of all hope.
That sounds...
Horrible.
It was like watching some bizarre astronomical event that you know you're never gonna see again.
You tell people the cold, hard truth all the time.
You get off on it.
Cause I don't care.
She cared.
She did it anyway.
She did it because she cared.
The angels of Christmas have finally given House a present he can appreciate.
Well, don't ruin it.
Don't pin this on Christ got the niesem.
- Ent had to die.
- Would you take off that hat.
It's Christmas.
It's a reindeer.
It's a moose on a Jew.
Who cares?
Things have their place.
You wouldn't hang dreidels from a Christmas tree.
You could.
Things don't care.
No, they don't.
Happy Solstice, House.
God rest ye merry, gentlemen.
Let nothing you dismay remember Christ our savior was born on Christmas day to save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray...
Don't you people know holiday spirit?
Bring me the eggnog of good cheer.
House, if you have something to say, say it.
If you don't give us a chance to get home before Santa.
Scrooge.
Give the patient risperidone.
That's an anti-psychotic.
She's dying.
She's not crazy.
I am going to perform a Christmas miracle.
Tidings of comfort and joy comfort and joy...
You said all the other causes of osteopetrosis are fatal.
Except for the one we discounted early.
Because it was impossible.
When a fetus forms, it's just a mass of cells.
Breast tissue covers an extensive portion of the body.
As the fetus develops, most of this tissue recedes, remaining only in the fun places.
But sometimes extra breast tissue is left behind in places where it doesn't belong.
Risperidone does a lot of things.
One is it makes breast tissue swell, so we can find it more easily.
You're telling me I could have breast cancer...
Somewhere not in my breasts?
That doesn't make sense.
Taub's parents have a winter condo in Florida, they're still New Yorkers.
- Actually, my parents.
- Don't care.
I told a parable.
Now I'm going to raise the dead.
Give me that syringe.
That's gotta be a fat deposit.
Yes, I could be wrong.
If I am, she's dead.
So shut up.
What's that?
Risperidone also causes galactorrhea.
What's that.
Galac-galactic?
Open your mouth.
Relax, you've had it before.
I am not.
Milk?
Eww!
We'll cut out your mom's tumor and start her on chemo.
All the rest of your symptoms should go away.
I love you.
I know.
Have a wonderful life.
You okay?
I'm thinking.
Thinking's not gonna get you to the top.
Mom, you're supposed to be encouraging me.
No, I'm supposed to be coaching you.
The slower you go, the more tired you're gonna get.
There's a hold about a foot above you on the left.
I know.
Nice grab!
Keep going.
You're almost there, babe.
I can't.
My calf's cramping.
You need to get off your toes.
Get on the ball of your foot.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can get all the way to the top.
It's okay.
I got you.
You all right?
Looks like you were wrong.
Yeah.
But you did awesome.
That's the highest you've gotten.
I'm proud of you.
I don't feel so good.
Okay.
Come on down.
Mom?
Mom, are you okay?
Oh, my God.
Whoa!
Did you see that?
You all right?
My arm.
I think I broke it.
Don't move.
Oh, Jane, I'm so sorry.
What happened?
Did the rope break?
No.
My hands, I can't move them.
She's been to an ortho, two neuros and an immunologist.
None of the treatments have had any effect.
You think it's over?
It's getting worse.
Last neurologist found intermittent numbness in both arms as well as the hand paralysis.
I meant the game.
You think he's gonna keep all four of us?
He said he would.
No sign of upper motor neuron involvement.
He lies.
My ears are burning.
Tell him you're done firing people.
Well, if I lie, that would be little reassurance.
Dr. Kutner, who told you that it would be a good idea to put up superficial representations of a hypocritical season celebrating a mythical figure?
It wasn't me.
He lied.
Homey knows better, Hymie doesn't care, and Huntington's would have done a better job.
I don't have Huntington's.
That you know of.
Why would you...
Because I got sued when I called you "honey buns. "
Am I fired if I put up...
The point of the game was to scare us.
Telling us it's over isn't scary.
Therefore, he has no reason to say that unless it's true.
Good.
Then, can we do a Secret Santa?
I liked you better 15 seconds ago when you were afraid for your job.
So, who's sick?
35-year-old single mom.
It's an odd presentation of paralysis.
Is there any history of drug use?
No.
She says there's no history.
She's not a liar.
Okay.
This is gonna be a tough case.
I have almost no knowledge of alien physiology.
Everyone lies.
But there's an exception to every rule.
Actually, there isn't.
That's kind of what makes it a rule.
The patient's mother died of breast cancer when she was seven.
She never even knew her mom was sick.
She promised herself she would never hide anything from her own daughter.
Oh.
I didn't know she'd promised.
And we're not her daughter.
The patient inherited the BRCA1 mutation from her mom.
She had a prophylactic double mastectomy 10 years ago.
She lied about it.
She told her co-workers.
She told her kid.
She lied to the world.
Reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people that...
She didn't get reconstructive surgery.
Okay.
We can rule out breast cancer.
Actually, I was gonna rule it in.
Paralysis could be paraneoplastic.
Even the best surgeon can't remove every cell of breast tissue.
MRI what's left of her chest.
Set the machine to scan for irony.
I'm gonna go re-do the patient history.
Your mom tell you about all the drugs she does?
She smokes pot once in a while, but not in a long time.
What about you?
How would that make her sick?
Are you a doctor?
I'm 11.
That's not an answer.
That's an evasion.
Drinking?
You ever sneak a drink?
I don't do any of that stuff.
It's bad for you.
I understand why you don't want your mom to know.
But I'm her doctor, so...
No, I would tell my mom.
And I would tell you.
Why?
Because she would never lie to me.
What's her favorite way to have sex?
I don't get what sex has to do with breast cancer.
Are you a doctor?
Did you go to med school since the last time I asked?
You just think we've got to be lying to...
White lies?
What are those?
Those are lies we tell to make other people feel better.
I don't lie.
Rationalizations?
What are those?
Those are lies we tell to make ourselves feel better.
No.
We don't...
Lies of omission?
Saddle, bronc or doggie?
That's sex talk.
She used to like being on top, but now she likes to be on her stomach.
That way she doesn't have to see them looking at her scars.
It's child abuse.
Honesty?
There's a reason that everybody lies.
It works.
It's what allows society to function.
It's what separates man from beast.
Oh, I thought that was our thumbs.
You want to know every place your mom's thumb has been?
I'm sorry.
I missed rehearsal.
Am I taking the truth-is-good side?
Don't you usually take that part?
Lies are a tool.
They can be used either for good...
Wait.
I've got a better one.
Lies are like children.
They're hard work but they're worth it because the future depends on them.
You are so full of love or something.
When you care about someone...
You lie to them.
You pretend that their constant, ponderous musings are interesting.
You tell them they're not losing their boyish good looks or becoming worn out and...
I stand corrected.
And may I say it's been a real pleasure chatting with you.
Axilla is clean.
Surgical margins look clear.
No lymphadenopathy, no masses, no nothing.
It's not cancer.
We need a new theory.
You catch her lying?
Not yet.
Wouldn't no have been a shorter answer?
Wouldn't you not talking have made this a shorter conversation?
Kid says Mom's a slut.
She called her mom a slut?
No.
I called her mom a slut.
She jumps anything with a pole and a pulse.
Not that I'm judging, here.
Given her medical history, I'm actually impressed.
Maggie already admitted to having multiple sexual partners.
Which is why we already tested for, and ruled out, syphilis and any other STD that could have caused her symptoms.
STDs aren't the only risk in risky sex.
The problem in sleeping with strangers is, they're strange.
We'll follow up with any recent partners.
Send Foreman and Taub.
They're better liars.
More likely to get to the truth.
You think I drugged her?
Use a coaster.
We're not cops.
Legally, we don't care one way or another.
But we need to know the truth so we can help her.
I'd known her for less than an hour and she offered to take me home.
There was no need to drug her.
Not that I would.
She's gonna be okay, right?
As long as she doesn't have to pick up or hold anything, yeah.
Sorry.
I just had the floors done.
Reclaimed pine.
You always this thirsty?
I don't know.
Water's supposed to be good for you, right?
Dehydration, anxiety, aggression.
I'm not aggressive.
Spastic chorea in his right hand.
What about my hand?
How much do you weigh?
About 180, 190?
180.
What is this?
If you took what she did, it could take longer to hit you.
It might affect you differently.
But you didn't give her anything, right?
She was really drunk.
I just gave her some E to help enhance things.
Have any of it left?
Is my hand gonna be okay?
There's nothing wrong with it.
We lied.
I've had a sore throat for a few days now.
My stomach's also been bothering me.
I think my glands are swollen.
Saint Nicholas?
Patron saint of children.
Also seamen, merchants, archers, prostitutes and prisoners.
Mmm.
He must have been pretty hard working.
Or just a credit hog.
Open wide.
Say, "Ah. " Ah.
You have strep.
Is it contagious?
Only for the next 24 hours, as long as you take the antibiotics.
How contagious?
Take a personal day.
I can't.
I'll write your pimp a note.
My pimp?
You get tested for AIDS every three months.
And your necklace.
Prostitutes wear religious symbols?
I think they just like kneeling.
You don't have the skin of a seaman, the fingers of an archer, the clothes of a merchant or the attitude of an ex-con.
So, that just leaves one left.
Mmm, two, actually.
But I'm not a child, am I?
You owe me 50 bucks.
Then you owe me half a lap dance.
It's for the nurses' holiday bonus.
I know you got the memo.
I got the memo last year.
I want to hire 40 more fellows.
You already fired the ones you hired?
They work better when they're scared.
You were right.
Guy slipped her Ecstasy.
He have any symptoms?
No.
Kutner's starting the patient on hemodialysis, and Thirteen's in the lab trying to figure out what the guy put in the drugs.
See?
Clear, simple statement of facts describing their cooperation with absolutely no attitude or fear.
Something's got to be done.
Oh, yeah.
How are you feeling?
I still can't move my hands.
It will take a few more hours to cycle all your blood through the machine.
What just happened?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
The lights just went out.
Didn't they?
What did you do?
Is this from the drugs?
Most of the drugs should be out of your system by now.
And our drugs wouldn't...
I can't see.
Do something!
I can't see!
I can't see!
Nothing in the Ecstasy except Ecstasy.
Well, that never hurt anybody.
Can't make them blind days later.
Do you spell "Homey" with a "Y"?
I want to be respectful.
You're actually gonna let us do Secret Santa?
Not just you guys.
I like presents, too.
Pick a name.
Why are you doing this?
See, this is why no one likes your people.
The notion of picking one time of the year to be decent to other people is obscene 'cause it's actually validating the notion of being miserable wretches the rest of the year.
So, you think this is the part of the year that's screwed up?
On the other hand, you are now a team.
You've got to work together.
And the simple fact is, giving people crap makes people like people.
So, spend 25 bucks.
Learn to love.
Blindness could be a complication from the hemodialysis.
No, the dialysate composition was within range.
Sweet.
Interesting.
The dialysate composition just indicates...
Indicates nothing.
I was referring to his reaction to the name he got.
I was pleased.
I thought it'd be fun to buy for...
Means there's someone here it wouldn't be fun to buy for.
I wonder who.
Pick a name.
Then go check out the patient's house.
Interesting.
We're wasting time going to the home.
Kearns-Sayre Syndrome fits the symptoms.
No family history of Kearns.
Go to their house.
She would have told us if there were any other drugs.
You met her.
She couldn't have been more candid.
You're absolutely right.
Go to their house...
MS or a vascular problem fits better.
They could affect hands and eyes.
Fine.
Do an MRI, check for MS.
And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.
Oh, and whoever goes to their house, get me their computers.
You talk to your kid about sex so she'll think you're being open about everything.
It keeps her from asking questions about things you don't want to talk about.
That's right.
Her honesty proves just how dishonest she is.
Yes!
Exactly who I wanted.
This is gonna be fun.
The dye may sting when it enters your bloodstream.
Are you scared, Mom?
Yeah.
Are you?
Yeah.
Are they?
They don't look scared.
Either they're confident or they just don't care.
We're confident.
Okay if I shift you a bit?
I need to get you into position.
Your boss is weird.
Yeah, he is.
He thought he'd get information you may not have been telling us by...
Being a jerk?
You'd be surprised how often it works.
Choroidal flush looks good.
Why would people lie to a doctor?
Dozens of reasons to lie.
Only one reason to tell the truth.
You're never even tempted?
I mean, lies do sometimes smooth things out, make life easier.
Yeah?
Your life easy?
Not even close.
Dye's reached the retinal capillary bed.
No leakage.
That's good, right?
It means it's not a vascular problem.
But?
A vascular problem we could fix.
They look worried now, Mom.
What's with the Secret Santa?
You trying to bring them together?
Want to drive them apart.
With gift giving?
Conflict's built right into the name.
Santa's about sharing.
Secret's about withholding.
Aside from the Trojan horse, gifts don't usually...
What did you get your wife for your final anniversary?
Uh, a sweater.
She hated it.
She loved it.
Then you didn't buy it.
I gave her some cash and...
Gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly how little we know about a person.
And nothing pisses off a person more than being shoved in the wrong pigeonhole.
Nice.
I'm thinking of spending a few extra bucks on my Secret Santa.
Bad idea.
You mind if I tell House you asked them for the key instead of breaking in?
Yes.
I do.
Just another 5 bucks. 5 will be 10.
The key's proof she doesn't have anything to hide.
The key is proof I didn't do exactly what House told me to do.
And what do you care if it's another 15?
I'm gonna tell him.
Who are you so anxious to please?
Not you.
You really think you're gonna prove people are capable of honesty using a mother and daughter you've known for one day?
I'm not the one who's based his entire worldview on the proposition.
If I'm wrong, so what?
If he's wrong...
So, you've got Huntington's?
Nope.
But House said that...
If I wanted to talk about it, why didn't I bring it up?
Fluorescein angiogram was clear.
No leaks.
No lesions.
Definitely not a vascular problem.
Someone get their birthdays out of the file.
Have you tried leaving it blank?
Tough to get into the head of someone who actually trusts people, huh?
Found both computers in an office on a desk they share.
No sign of macular degeneration or optic neuritis.
Her eyes are completely normal.
Except she can't see out of them.
So she says.
You find anything on the MRI?
No sign of plaques.
It's not MS.
We haven't found anything abnormal on any tests.
Except she can't see or move her hands.
So she says.
You can't lie about flaccid paralysis.
Maybe she's not lying.
Her brain is.
What if it's a conversion disorder?
Lacks personal boundaries.
Promiscuous.
Inappropriate obsession with truth telling.
Certainly sounds like a psych case.
Cool.
I'll set up a psych consult and start her on anti-depressants.
No.
Her mind is tricking her body.
We need to trick her mind.
Or even better...
You don't need her.
I know.
Then this serves no medical purpose.
You have a genetic defect, choose to ignore it.
This woman has a genetic defect, chooses to butcher herself to be safe.
Yet, what you claim to be fascinated by is her honesty.
Interesting.
You claim to want the truth.
And then you screw with people who actually live by it.
Pathetic.
Hey, I gave you credit for interesting.
You're protecting her because you're jealous she did what you couldn't.
I need you.
I'm not lying to her.
Fine.
Keep your mouth shut.
I still need you.
If it doesn't work, you've got to hold the kid down until someone else finishes lying to Mom.
That does actually serve a medical purpose.
Jane.
I have to lie because she trusts me?
If you show doubt, the placebo treatment won't work.
If it's just depression, that's good news, right?
There are a lot of great medications.
Why can't we just give her those?
Why do we have to lie to her?
Because we might be wrong.
Those medications take a long time to work, and since your mom's condition's declining, there's a chance the drugs won't tell us anything until it's too late.
My mom's not depressed.
Maybe she's hiding it from you.
No.
She wouldn't.
She's doing what every good mom does.
Protecting her child from bad news that she can't do anything about.
My mom's never lied to me.
If you don't know how to lie, you don't know how to tell when you're being lied to.
Maybe you're right.
I know I'm...
I was lying.
I know how to lie.
I just won't do it to my mother.
You like foosball?
Until the treatment of your infectious paraparesis takes effect,
Jane can't come back into the room.
I've already been inoculated.
Can she have it already?
Don't worry.
It's a very effective treatment.
You should be feeling better in a matter of minutes.
Don't you think Jane deserves a few secrets?
Some personal space?
Room to make her own mistakes?
She makes plenty of mistakes.
Only difference is I'm there to help her through them.
But she's got to know you're looking over her shoulder.
It's got to stifle her.
I think the world would be a better place if everybody always acted like their mom was looking over their shoulder.
I want to go see my mom.
She's sleeping.
Why don't we just double the amount we can spend?
Nope.
Can't afford another 25?
If we allow people 50, people will spend 60.
Ah!
So, you can't afford another 35.
You must really like who you got.
Or really dislike.
My mom always gives the best presents to the teachers I get along with the worst.
No.
No.
How do you know no?
I know you didn't get House.
I know he didn't get House.
You gave them all your name?
Mmm-hmm.
I figured I could sow some dissension and get a few ties and sweaters.
What happens when they find out?
It's Secret Santa.
What happens when they find out?
They'll argue about what to do with that information.
The ties are less important than the dissension.
We still have to buy him something.
Not a chance.
We weren't supposed to discuss this.
We're not supposed to know.
He's not supposed to put his name in there five times.
He wants presents.
It's sad.
It's pathetic.
I'm still buying him a present.
No, you're not.
Fine.
What's wrong?
I think it's getting worse.
I can't breathe.
I need a nurse in here!
Her lymph nodes are cutting off her airway.
We've got to intubate!
The swollen lymph nodes were cutting off Maggie's airway.
We shrunk them with alcohol and she's breathing on her own now.
Well, that sucks.
Four thousand, three hundred saved emails and not a single mention of "lesbionic," "Sanchez," or "mangina. "
Swollen lymph nodes means it wasn't psychological.
Who's that from?
Santa, obviously.
As you know, I worship him.
Oh, wait.
I meant Satan.
I always get them confused.
What is an "alpine butterfly"?
And why is she learning how to do one?
House, we already have a full history.
You don't need to waste time...
It's just a climbing knot.
But what does she use it for?
Try "bondage. " I did once.
But she just tied me down and whined about how hard it is to be Dean of Medicine.
Gyms aren't exactly pristine.
Could be a fungal infection.
Seriously, who's it from?
No fever.
No elevated white count.
That's funny.
Friend sent her a Garfield cartoon.
That cat sure does love lasagna.
House, stop obsessing.
If it weren't for my obsessions, we wouldn't know that she has sarcoidosis.
Eighteen months ago, she sold her Stairmaster.
It was only two months old.
Now, either she needed the cash, or climbing stairs was getting more difficult.
Twelve months ago, she canceled a hiking trip.
Now, either she just wanted to sit home and watch TV, or walking was getting more difficult.
She's been suffering joint pain for the last two years.
Pull my ribbon.
If you know what I mean.
ACE levels are too low for sarcoidosis.
That's not what I meant.
Could just be an inactive phase.
It's not Christmas yet.
I remembered.
I'm not a Satanist.
I'm a Druid.
No lung involvement.
Yet.
We'll need a bronchoalveolar lavage to confirm it.
That's a shame.
I was gonna surprise her with one for Christmas.
Wow!
Now, either that cost more than 25 bucks, or I'm seriously starting to doubt Steve Jobs' business strategies.
Thanks!
Last round of saline, Maggie.
One more big breath.
You've got to get the liquid to go all the way into your lungs, okay?
Here we go.
The gift could be from a patient.
Who sent it to the wrong doctor?
House obviously gave the present to himself.
They're arguing right now.
I've been looking for this all morning.
Did you look in the box on my desk?
Oh, by the way, your mom called.
Your dad's dead.
You left the present sitting on your desk?
It wouldn't have been as effective sitting in a closet in my home.
They're gonna know it's from you.
No.
They're gonna guess that it was from me.
They might even be 90º/º sure that it was from me.
But all that means is they're 10º/º percent sure that one of the other guys is screwing them over.
Have you ever considered channeling your powers to,
I don't know, bring peace to the Mid-east?
I couldn't do that.
But if they ever got it, you could screw it up.
Yeah.
That's more where my powers lie.
The gift could be from Wilson.
It's House.
Why do you have a problem with him speculating?
Because that's what House wants us to do.
Lungs are pristine.
No infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.
Maggie, I'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?
A little harder.
Great.
Maggie?
Open your eyes.
Why aren't you saying anything?
What's wrong?
Maggie tested negative for sarcoidosis.
But she's bleeding into her eyes, now.
Have her platelets dropped?
Plummeted.
New labs show they're under 40.
She'll bleed out of every orifice if we don't find the cause.
Could be splenic sequestration, tuberculosis.
Gaucher disease, TTP.
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome, sepsis, lupus...
Listing all the possible causes is only impressive if you can do it reverse alphabetically.
We need to know why her platelet machine is broken.
Go to the factory.
Do a bone marrow aspiration.
I'm your Secret Santa.
You're not supposed to tell.
But you got a present already, which means you have more than one Secret Santa.
Or somebody else wants to make me happy.
Merry Christmas.
On the one hand, you should be in bed.
On the other hand, I told you to rest.
So, I see your dilemma.
Hey, I don't think resting is the problem.
Can strep cause this?
Clap on.
Trust me, first place I went.
No rash on my labia.
Do you need to take a look?
I'm saving my money for a Red Rider BB gun.
Darker shade of lipstick?
I'm not wearing any.
You tell your mother what you do?
It doesn't matter.
I'm curious.
I don't need to break her heart just so I can feel righteous.
Do you do a donkey show?
I'm not curious.
It matters.
It's a donkey or a mule.
I can never remember.
Wow.
That is a creepy smile.
I bet the donkey's is even creepier.
Do I have to explain...
Nope.
That's my job.
Contagious ecthyma.
Any contact can cause rashes, flu symptoms, sore throat.
Has there been contact?
Okay.
Antibiotic cream for you and a love glove for Francis.
You'll both be fine.
You should come and see the show.
I think you'd like it.
Sorry.
I hate Westerns.
So, they really never lie?
Doesn't seem like it.
Admirable.
You tell Cameron everything?
No.
You think she keeps secrets?
If I knew, they wouldn't be secrets.
I hope she does.
People have a right to a little privacy, even from the people they love.
Did you buy House a present?
Why would I?
To screw with me.
Then, I'm gonna say yes.
No, wait.
Stop.
Stop.
What's that smell?
The bone is smoking.
Her bones are harder than the drill?
We ran a full body bone scan to find the cause of hardening in the hip.
No hot spots anywhere.
Tracer could have been inactive.
So, I screwed up the test?
There are so many ways that could have happened.
Maybe it was inactive, maybe it didn't fully circulate...
It circulated.
The camera picked up.
Hey, hey.
It's Christmas.
Why are you guys fighting?
Why do you think there are no hot spots?
I did not screw up.
The density is consistent.
Just means the density was consistent.
Doesn't mean it was cold.
It's possible all she has are hot spots.
It's consistent because her entire skeleton is turning to stone.
Good for an aspiring superhero.
Fatal for a human hoping to make it to Kwanzaa.
It's got to be from a carbonic anhydrase type 2 deficiency.
It has free will.
It doesn't have to be anything it doesn't want to be.
I meant if it's not CA-2, well, none of the other causes of osteopetrosis are treatable.
You're right.
It's got to be.
Go run her blood and hope that your sunny optimism isn't misplaced.
They accused Kutner of screwing up a test because they hate him.
You're surprised?
That's the sort of crap that happens when you mess with people's heads.
One day, he will screw up a test.
And if they don't accuse him of that because they like him, someone could die.
Where are we going?
Nowhere.
I just know it hurts you.
CA-2 deficiency's a genetic disorder that scrambles proteins.
If the blood test is positive, you'll need a bone marrow transplant.
"Transplant" sounds like a euphemism for "slim odds. "
Slim but not none.
We're gonna need to test Jane for a match.
Don't you have donor banks?
Jane is your best bet.
The procedure is perfectly safe.
There's no risk.
No risk?
Any surgery has...
Then, don't tell me there's no risk.
You're gonna tell me there's no pain, either?
The testing will hurt a little.
I'll be fine.
If she doesn't do this and you don't make it, she's gonna spend the rest of her life blaming herself.
Mom, please.
Find someone else.
Let someone else take the risk.
Donor bank turned up a 49-year-old man in Cleveland who's a five out of six HLA match.
First flight out of Cleveland leaves at...
Why is a 49-year-old Cleveland man a closer match than her daughter?
He may not be.
Maggie didn't let us test her.
Why not?
Pain, danger, risk of...
Only reason to give multiple reasons is you're searching for what the person wants to hear.
House.
You're wrong about sainted Mommy.
Don't care.
You can forget the donor bank.
There's no CA-2 deficiency.
Best we can do is make her comfortable.
Is that from Taub?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Merry Christmas.
Who's gonna tell the patient she's dying?
I will.
And nobody leaves here until we find out what killed her.
Whatever she has is fatal.
Makes no difference if it's disease number 58 or 907.
Are you guys mad at me?
No.
You had no choice.
Of course I had a choice.
You had no choice once I made my choice.
And now, I'm choosing not to be mad at you.
Why?
Because it will drive House nuts.
Do you think that will make your lives better or worse?
I told my mom I don't care what she thinks.
I want you to test my marrow.
I can't be dying.
Sure you can.
You're wrong.
You don't even know what I have.
What you have is one last Christmas with your daughter.
One last chance to give her a present.
The truth.
It's inexpensive, highly valued.
Never have to stand in line to return it the day after Christmas.
What are you talking about?
A mother who's going to die doesn't refuse a donor test because it might hurt.
She refuses when she knows it won't match.
Which tends to happen when mother and daughter aren't mother and daughter.
I can do DNA tests if you'd rather keep lying to me.
I never wanted kids.
I loved them, but with my genes...
I knew this woman, a drug addict.
She got pregnant, didn't want to have an abortion.
But she also didn't want her daughter to ever know who her real mother was.
What she was.
I promised never to tell.
A promise to an addict is worth more than a promise to your daughter?
Lt'd be cruel to tell her.
Right.
She lives a lie.
You get to die a hypocrite.
Mom?
The doctors told me what's happening.
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
I promise you.
Doctors can be wrong.
There's still a chance I can beat...
You really believe that?
I do.
No, Mom.
You're dying.
Nobody can help you.
It's not gonna be okay.
That was cold.
Yeah.
What did you get for Christmas?
I got a watch, a vintage LP, and a second edition Conan Doyle.
And if that wasn't bad enough, my patient's dying.
Christmas deaths in a hospital.
There's nothing more depressing.
No one ever wants to go in the patient's room.
Even the candy stripers leave them alone.
But I saw something amazing.
Pure truth.
She told her mother that she was dying.
Stripped her of all hope.
That sounds horrible.
It was like watching some bizarre astronomical event that you know you're never gonna see again.
You tell people the cold, hard truth all the time.
You get off on it.
Because I don't care.
She cared.
And she did it, anyway.
She did it because she cared.
The angels of Christmas have finally given House a present he can appreciate.
Oh, don't ruin it.
Don't pin this on Christ.
He's got enough nails in him.
Patient had to die...
Why don't you take off that hat?
It's Christmas.
It's a reindeer.
It's a moose, on a Jew.
Who cares?
Things have their place.
You wouldn't hang dreidels from a Christmas tree.
You could.
Things don't care.
No, they don't.
Happy solstice, House.
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Have you people no holiday spirit?
Bring me the eggnog of good cheer.
House, if you have something to say, say it.
If you don't, give us a chance to get home before Santa.
Scrooge.
Give the patient risperidone.
That's an anti-psychotic.
She's dying.
She's not crazy.
I am gonna perform a Christmas miracle.
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy Comfort and joy
You said all the other causes of osteopetrosis are fatal.
Except for the one we discounted early because it was impossible.
When a fetus forms, it's just a mass of cells.
Breast tissue covers extensive portions of the body.
As the fetus develops, most of this tissue recedes remaining only in the fun places.
But sometimes, extra breast tissue is left behind in places where it doesn't belong.
Risperidone does a lot of things.
One is it makes breast tissue swell so we can find it more easily.
You're telling me I could have breast cancer?
Somewhere not in my breasts?
That doesn't make sense.
Taub's parents have a winter condo in Florida.
They're still New Yorkers.
Actually, my parents...
Don't care.
I told a parable.
Now, I'm gonna raise the dead.
Give me that syringe.
That's got to be a fat deposit.
Yes, I could be wrong.
If I am, she's dead.
So, shut up.
What's that?
Risperidone also causes galactorrhea.
What's that?
Galactic?
Open your mouth.
Relax.
You've had it before.
I am not...
Milk?
Ew!
We'll cut out your mom's tumor and start her on chemo.
All the rest of your symptoms should go away.
I love you.
I know.
Have a wonderful life.
You okay?
I'm thinking.
Thinking's not gonna get you to the top.
Mom, you're supposed to be encouraging me.
No, i'm supposed to be coaching you.
The slower you go, the more tired you're gonna get.
There's a hold about a foot above you on the left.
I know.
Nice grab.
Keep going, you're almost there, babe.
I can't.
My calf's cramping.
You need to get off your toes.
Get on the ball of your foot.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
You can get all the way to the top.
It's okay, i got you.
You all right?
Looks like you were wrong.
Yeah, but you did awesome.
That's the highest you've gotten.
I'm proud of you.
I don't feel so good.
Okay, come on down.
Mom?
Mom, are you okay?
Oh, god.
- Are you all right?
- My arm...
I think i broke it.
Don't move.
God, Jane, i'm so sorry.
What happened?
Did the rope break?
-No.
My hands...
I can't move them.

She's been to an ortho,
Two neuros, and an immunologist.
None of the treatments have had any effect.
You think it's over?
It's getting worse.
Last neurologist found intermittent numbness
In both arms as well as the hand paralysis.
I meant the game.
You think he's gonna keep all four of us?
He said he would.
No sign of upper motor neuron involvement.
He lies.
My ears are burning.
Tell 'em you're done firing people.
Well, if i lie...
That would be little reassurance.
Dr. Kutner,
Who told you that it would be a good idea
To put up superficial representations
Of a hypocritical season
Celebrating a mythical figure?
It wasn't me.
He lied.
Homey knows better,
Hymie doesn't care,
And Huntington's would have done a better job.
I don't have Huntington's.
That you know of.
Why would you- Because i got sued
When i called you "Honeybuns. "
Am i fired if i put up-
The point of the game was to scare us.
Telling us it's over isn't scary.
Therefore he has no reason to say that
Unless it's true.
Good.
Then can we do a secret santa?
I liked you better 15 seconds ago
When you were afraid for your job.
So who's sick?
35-Year-Old single mom.
It's an odd presentation of paralysis.
Is there any history of drug use?
No.
She says there's no history.
She's not a liar.
Okay, this is gonna be a tough case.
I have almost no knowledge of alien physiology.
Everyone lies, but there's an exception to every rule.
Actually, there isn't.
That's kinda what makes it a rule.
The patient's mother died of breast cancer
When she was seven.
She never even knew her mom was sick.
She promised herself
She would never hide anything from her own daughter.
Oh, i didn't know she promised.
And we're not her daughter.
The patient inherited the brca1 mutation
From her mom.
She got a prophylactic double mastectomy ten years ago.
She lied about it.
She told her co-Workers.
She told her kid.
She lied to the world.
Reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people-
She didn't get reconstructive surgery.
Okay, we can rule out breast cancer.
Actually, i was gonna rule it in.
Paralysis could be paraneoplastic.
Even the best surgeon can't remove
Every cell of breast tissue.
Mri what's left of her chest.
Set the machine to scan for irony.
I'm gonna go redo the patient history.
Your mom tell you about all the drugs she does?
She smokes pot once in a while,
But not in a long time.
What about you?
How would that make her sick?
Are you a doctor?
I'm 11.
That's not an answer.
That's an evasion.
Like drinking?
You ever sneak a drink?
I don't do any of that stuff.
It's bad for you.
I understand why you don't want your mom to know.
But i'm her doctor, so- I would tell my mom.
And i would tell you.
Why?
Because she would never lie to me.
What's her favorite way to have sex?
I don't get what sex has to do with breast cancer.
Are you a doctor?
Did you go to med school since the last time i asked?
You just think we've got to be lying to-
White lies?
What are those?
Those are lies we tell
To make other people feel better.
I don't lie.
Rationalizations?
What are those?
Those are lies we tell to make ourselves feel better.
No, we don't...
Lies of omission?
Saddle bronc or doggie?
That's sex talk.
She used to like being on top.
But now she likes to be on her stomach.
That way she doesn't have to see them
Looking at her scars.
It's child abuse.
Honesty?
There's a reason that everybody lies-
It works.
It's what allows society to function.
It's what separates man from beast.
Oh, i thought that was our thumbs.
You wanna know every place your mom's thumb has been?
I'm sorry, i missed rehearsal.
Am i taking the "truth is good" side?
Don't you usually take that part?
Lies are a tool to be used either for good...
No, wait.
I got a better one.
Lies are like children.
Hard work, but they're worth it,
Because the future depends on 'em.
You are so full of love...
or something.
When you care about someone-
You lie to them!
You pretend that their constant ponderous musings
Are interesting.
You tell them that they're not losing
Their boyish good looks
Or becoming worn out and-
I stand corrected.
And may i say it's been a real pleasure
Chatting with you.
Axilla's clean.
Surgical margins look clear.
No lymphadenopathy, no masses, no nothing.
It's not cancer.
We need a new theory.
You catch her lying?
Not yet.
Wouldn't "no" have been a shorter answer?
Wouldn't you not talking have made this
A shorter conversation?
Kid says mom's a slut.
She called her mom a slut?
No, i called her mom a slut.
She jumps anything with a pole and a pulse.
Not that i'm judging here.
Given her medical history, i'm actually impressed.
Maggie already admitted to having multiple sexual partners,
Which is why we already tested for
And ruled out syphilis and any other std
That could have caused her symptoms.
Stds aren't the only risk in risky sex.
The problem in sleeping with strangers is
They're strange.
We'll follow up with any recent partners.
Send foreman and taub.
They're better liars.
More likely to get to the truth.
You think i drugged her?
Use a coaster.
We're not cops.
Legally, we don't care one way or another.
But we need to know the truth so we can help her.
I'd known her for less than an hour,
And she offered to take me home.
There was no need to drug her.
Not that i would.
She's gonna be okay, right?
As long as she doesn't have to pick up or hold anything.
Yeah.
Sorry, i just had the floors done.
Reclaimed pine.
You always this thirsty?
I don't know.
Water's supposed to be good for you, right?
Dehydration, anxiety,
Aggression...
i'm not aggressive.
Spastic chorea in his right hand.
What about my hand?
How much you weigh?
About 180, 190?
180.
What is the-
If you took what she did,
It could take longer to hit you.
It might affect you differently.
But you didn't give her anything... right?
She was really drunk.
I just gave her some "e"
To help enhance things.
Have any of it left?
Is my hand gonna be okay?
There's nothing wrong with it.
We lied.
I've had a sore throat for a few days now.
My stomach's also been bothering me.
I think my glands are swollen.
Saint nicholas?
Patron saint of children.
Also seamen, merchants, archers,
Prostitutes, and prisoners.
Hmm, must've been pretty hard-Working.
Or just a credit hog.
Open wide.
Say ahh.
Ahh...
You have strep.
Is it contagious?
Only for the next 24 hours,
As long as you take the antibiotics.
How contagious?
Take a personal day.
I can't.
I'll write your pimp a note.
My pimp?
You're tested for aids every three months,
And your necklace.
Prostitutes wear religious symbols.
I think they just like kneeling.
You don't have the skin of a seaman,
The fingers of an archer, the clothes of a merchant,
Or the attitude of an ex-Con.
So it just leaves one left.
Two, actually.
But i'm not a child, am i?
You owe me 50 bucks.
Then you owe me half a lap dance.
It's for the nurses' holiday bonus.
I know you got the memo.
I got the memo last year.
I want to hire 40 more fellows.
You already fired the ones you hired?
They work better when they're scared.
You were right.
Guy slipped her ecstasy.
He have any symptoms?
No.
Kutner's starting the patient on hemodialysis,
And thirteen's in the lab trying to figure out
What the guy put in the drugs.
See?
A clear, simple statement of facts
Describing their cooperation
With absolutely no attitude or fear.
Something's gotta be done.
Oh, yeah.
How are you feeling?
I still can't move my hands.
It'll take a few more hours
To cycle all your blood through the machine.
What just happened?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
The lights just went out.
Didn't they?
What did you do?
Is this from the drugs?
Most of the drugs should be out of your system by now.
And our drugs- I can't see.
Do something.
I can't see.
I can't see!
Nothing in the ecstasy except ecstasy.
Well, that never hurt anybody.
It can't make 'em blind days later.
Do you spell "Homie" with a "Y"?
I want to be respectful.
You're actually gonna let us do secret santa?
Not just you guys.
I like presents too.
Pick a name.
Why are you doing this?
See, this is why no one likes your people.
The notion of picking one time of the year
To be decent to other people is obscene,
'Cause it's actually validating the notion
Of being miserable wretches the rest of the year.
So you think this is the part of the year
That's screwed up?
On the other hand, you are now a team.
You've gotta work together.
And the simple fact is, giving people crap
Makes people like people.
So spend 25 bucks.
Learn to love.
Blindness could be a complication
From the hemodialysis.
No, the dialysate composition was within range.
Sweet.
Interesting.
Dialysate composition just indicates-
Nothing.
I was referring to his reaction
To the name he got.
I was pleased.
I thought it would be fun to buy-
Means there's someone here
It wouldn't be fun to buy for.
I wonder who.
Pick a name.
Then go check out the patient's house.
Interesting.
We're wasting time going to the home.
Kearns-Sayre syndrome fits the symptoms.
No family history of kearns.
Go to their house-
She would have told us if there were any other drugs.
You met her.
She couldn't have been more candid.
You're absolutely right.
Go to their house-
Ms or vascular problem fits better.
They could affect hands and eyes.
Fine, do an mri, check for ms.
And a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes
To see if we missed a bleed somewhere.
Oh, and whoever goes to their house,
Get me their computers.
You talk to your kid about sex
So she'll think
You're being open about everything.
Keeps her from asking questions about the things
You don't want to talk about.
That's right.
Her honesty proves just how dishonest she is.
Yes!
Exactly who i wanted.
This is gonna be fun.
The dye may sting when it enters your bloodstream.
Are you scared, mom?
Yeah.
Are you?
Yeah.
Are they?
They don't look scared.
Either they're confident or they just don't care.
We're confident.
Okay if i shift you a bit?
Get you into position.
Your boss is weird.
Yeah, he is.
He thought he'd get information
You may not have been telling us by
- Being a jerk?
You'd be surprised how often it works.
Choroidal flush looks good.
Why would people lie to a doctor?
Dozens of reasons to lie,
Only one reason to tell the truth.
You're never even tempted?
I mean, lies do sometimes smooth things out,
Make life easier.
Yeah?
Your life easy?
Not even close.
The dye has reached the retinal capillary bed.
No leakage.
That's good, right?
It means it's not a vascular problem.
What?
A vascular problem we could fix.
They look worried now, mom.
What's with the secret santa?
You trying to bring them together?
I want to drive them apart.
With gift giving?
Conflict's built right into the name.
Santa's about sharing.
A secret's about withholding.
Aside from the trojan horse, gifts don't usually-
What'd you get your wife
For your final anniversary?
Uh... a sweater.
She hated it.
She loved it.
Then you didn't buy it.
I gave her some cash...
And...
Gifts allow us to demonstrate
Exactly how little we know about a person.
And nothing pisses off a person more
Than being shoved in the wrong pigeonhole.
Yes.
I'm thinking of spending a few extra bucks
On my secret santa.
Bad idea.
You mind if i tell house you asked them for the key
Instead of breaking in?
Yes, i do.
Just another five bucks.
Five will be ten.
The key's proof she doesn't have anything to hide.
The key is proof i didn't do exactly
What house told me to do.
And what do you care if it's another $15?
I'm gonna tell him.
Who are you so anxious to please?
Not you.
You really think you're going to prove
People are capable of honesty
Using a mother and daughter you've known for one day?
I'm not the one who's based his entire world view
On the proposition.
If i'm wrong, so what?
If he's wrong...
So you've got huntington's?
Nope.
But house said that you-
If i wanted to talk about it, why didn't i bring it up?
Fluorescein angiogram was clear.
No leaks, no lesions.
Definitely not a vascular problem.
Someone get their birthdays out of the file.
Have you tried leaving it blank?
Tough to get into the head of someone
Who actually trusts people, huh?
Found both computers in an office
On a desk they share.
No sign of macular degeneration or optic neuritis.
Her eyes are completely normal.
Except she can't see out of them.
So she says.
Find anything on the mri?
No sign of plaques.
It's not ms.
We haven't found anything abnormal
On any test.
Except she can't see or move her hands.
So she says.
You can't lie about flaccid paralysis.
Maybe she's not lying.
Her brain is.
What if it's a conversion disorder?
Lacks personal boundaries...
Promiscuous...
Inappropriate obsession with truth telling.
Certainly sounds like a psych case.
Cool, i'll set up a psych consult,
Start her on anti-Depressants.
No.
Her mind is tricking her body.
We need to trick her mind.
Or even better.
You don't need her.
I know.
Then this serves no medical purpose.
You have a genetic defect, choose to ignore it.
This woman has a genetic defect.
She chooses to butcher herself
To be safe.
Yet what you claim to be fascinated by
Is her honesty.
Interesting.
You claim to want the truth...
And then you screw with people
Who actually live by it.
- Pathetic.
- Hey, i gave you credit for "interesting. "
You're protecting her because you're jealous
She did what you couldn't.
I need you.
I'm not lying to her.
Fine, keep your mouth shut.
I still need you.
If it doesn't work, you gotta hold the kid down
Until someone else finishes lying to mom.
That does actually serve a medical purpose.
Jane.
I have to lie because she trusts me?
If you show doubt,
The placebo treatment won't work.
If it's just depression, that's good news, right?
There are a lot of great medications.
Then why can't we just give her those?
Why do we have to lie to her?
Because we might be wrong.
And those medications take a long time to work,
And since you're mom's condition is declining...
There's a chance the drugs won't tell us anything
Until it's too late.
My mom's not depressed.
Maybe she's hiding it from you.
No.
She wouldn't-
She's doing what every good mom does:
Protecting her child from bad news
That she can't do anything about.
My mom's never lied to me.
If you don't know how to lie,
You don't know how to tell when you're being lied to.
Maybe you're right.
I know- I was lying.
I know how to lie.
I just won't do it to my mother.
You like foosball?
Until the treatment of your infectious paraparesis
Takes effect,
Jane can't come back into the room.
I've already been inoculated.
Can she have it already?
Don't worry,
It's a very effective treatment.
You should be feeling better in a matter of minutes.
Don't you think jane deserves a few secrets?
Some personal space-
Room to, uh...
make her own mistakes?
She makes plenty of mistakes.
Only difference is i'm there to help her through them.
But she's gotta know you're looking over her shoulder.
It's gotta stifle-
I think the world would be a better place
If everybody always acted like their mom was
Looking over their shoulder.
I want to go see my mom.
She's sleeping.
Why don't we just double the amount we can spend?
Nope.
Can't afford another $25?
If we allow people $50, people will spend $60.
Oh, so you can't afford another $35.
You must really like who you got.
Or really dislike.
My mom always gives the best presents
To the teachers i get along with the worst.
No.
No.
How do you know "no"?
I know you didn't get house.
I know he didn't get house.
You gave themall your name?
Mm-Hmm.
Figured i could sow some dissention
And get a few ties and sweaters.
What happens when they find out?
It's secret santa.
And what happens when they find out?
They'll argue about what to do with that information.
The ties are less important than the dissention.
We still have to buy him something.
Not a chance.
We weren't supposed to discuss this.
We're not supposed to know.
He's not supposed to put his name in there five times.
He wants presents.
It's sad.
It's pathetic.
I'm still buying him a present.
No, you're not.
Fine!
What's wrong?
I think it's getting worse.
I can't breathe.
I need a nurse in here!
The lymph nodes are cutting off her airway.
We've got to intubate!
The swollen lymph nowere cutting
Maggie's airway.
We shrunk 'em with alcohol.
She's breathing on her own now.
That sucks.
4,300 saved emails,
And not a single mention of "lesbionic," "sanchez,"
Or "Man-Gina. "
Swollen lymph nodes means
It wasn't psychological.
Who's that from?
Santa, obviously.
'Cause you know i worship him.
No, wait, i mean satan.
I always get 'em confused.
What is an alpine butterfly?
And why is she learning how to do one?
House, we already have a full history.
You don't need to waste time
- It's just a climbing knot.
But what does she use it for?
Try bondage.
I did once.
She just tied me down and whined about how hard it is
To be dean of medicine.
Gyms aren't exactly pristine.
Could be a fungal infection.
Seriously, who's it from?
No fever, no elevated white count.
Ah!
That's funny.
Her friend sent her a garfield cartoon.
That cat sure does love lasagna.
House!
Stop obsessing.
If it weren't for my obsessions,
You wouldn't know that she has sarcoidosis.
18 months ago she sold her stairmaster.
It was only two months old.
Now, eithershe needed the cash, or climbing stairs
Was getting more difficult.
12 months ago, she canceled a hiking trip.
Now, either she just wanted to sit home and watch tv,
Or walking was getting more difficult.
She's been suffering joint pain for the last two years.
Pull my ribbon, if you know what i mean.
A.C.E. Levels are too low for sarcoidosis.
That's not what i meant.
Could just be an inactive phase.
It's not christmas yet.
I remembered i'm not a satanist, i'm a druid.
No lung involvement.
Yet.
We'll need a bronchoalveolar lavage to confirm it.
That's a shame-
I was gonna surprise her with one for christmas.
Wow!
Now, either that cost more than 25 bucks
Or i'm seriously starting to doubt
Steve jobs' business strategies.
But thanks!
Last round of saline, maggie.
One more big breath.
We've gotta get the liquid to go all the way
Into your lungs, okay?
Here we go.
The gift could be from a patient.
Who sent it to the wrong doctor?
House obviously gave the present to himself.
They're arguing right now.
I've been looking for this all morning.
Did you look in the box on my desk?
Oh, by the way, your mom called.
Your dad's dead.
You left the present sitting on your desk?
It wouldn't have been as effective
Sitting in a closet in my home.
They're gonna know it's from you.
No, they're gonna guess that it was from me.
Might even be 90% sure that it was from me,
But all that means is they're 10% sure
That one of the other guys is screwing them over.
Have you ever considered channeling your powers
To, i don't know, bring peace to the mid-East?
I couldn't do that.
But if they ever got it, you could screw it up?
Yeah, that's more where my powers lie.
Gift could be from wilson.
It's house.
Why do you have a problem with him speculating?
Because that's what house wants us to do.
Lungs are pristine.
No infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.
Maggie, i'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?
A little harder.
Great.
Maggie, open your eyes.
Why aren't you saying anything?
What's wrong?
Maggie tested negative for sarcoidosis.
But she's bleeding into her eyes now.
Have her platelets dropped?
Plummeted.
New labs show they're under 40.
She'll bleed out of every orifice
If we don't find the cause.
Could be splenic sequestration, tuberculosis...
Gaucher disease, ttp-
Hemolytic uremic syndrome, sepsis-
Listing all the possible causes is only impressive
If you can do it reverse-Alphabetically.
We need to know why her platelet machine is broken.
Go to the factory.
Do a bone marrow aspiration.
I'm your secret santa.
You're not supposed to tell.
But you got a present already.
Which means you have more than one secret santa.
Or somebody else wants to make me happy.
Merry christmas.
On one hand, you should be in bed.
And on the other hand, i told you to rest.
So i see your dilemma.
I don't think resting is the problem.
Can strep cause this?
Clap on...
Trust me, first place i went.
No rash on my labia.
Do you need to take a look?
I'm saving my money for a red ryder bb gun.
Darker shade of lipstick?
I'm not wearing any.
You tell your mother what you do?
It doesn't matter.
I'm curious.
I don't need to break her heart just so i can feel righteous.
Do you do a donkey show?
I'm not curious.
It matters.
It's a donkey or a mule.
I can never remember.
Wow...
That is a creepy smile.
I bet the donkey's is even creepier.
Do i have to explain?
Nope.
That's my job.
Contagious ecthyma.
Any contact can cause rashes, flu symptoms,
Sore throat.
Has there been... contact?
Okay, antibiotic cream for you,
And a love glove for francis.
You'll both be fine.
You should come see the show.
I think you'd like it.
Sorry, i hate westerns.
So they really never lie?
Doesn't seem like it.
Admirable.
You tell cameron everything?
Ha!
No.
You think she keeps secrets?
If i knew, they wouldn't be secrets.
I hope she does.
People have a right to a little privacy,
Even from the people they love.
You buy house a present?
Why would i?
To screw with me.
Then i'm gonna say yes.
Wait, wait, stop, stop.
What's that smell?
The bone is smoking.
Her bones are harder than the drill?
We ran a full-Body bone scan
To find the cause of hardening in the hip.
No hot spots anywhere.
Tracer could have been inactive.
So i screwed up the test?
There are so many ways that could have happened.
Maybe it was inactive.
Maybe it didn't fully circulate.
It circulated.
The camera picked up-
Hey, hey- It's christmas.
Why are you guys fighting?
Why do you think there are no hot spots?
I did not screw up.
The density's consistent.
It just means the density was consistent.
It doesn't mean it was cold.
It's possible all she has are hot spots.
It's consistent
Because her entire skeleton is turning to stone.
Good for an aspiring superhero.
Fatal for a human hoping to make it to kwanzaa.
It's gotta be from a Carbonic Anhydrase Type-II deficiency.
It has free will- It doesn't have to be anything
- It doesn't want to be.
- I meant, if it's not CA-2...
Well, none of the other causes of osteopetrosis are treatable.
You're right.
It's gotta be.
We'll run her blood
And hope that your sunny optimism
Isn't misplaced.
They accused kutner of screwing up a test
Because they hate him.
You're surprised?
That's the sort of crap that happens
When you mess with people's heads.
One day he will screw up a test.
If they don't accuse him of that because they like him,
Someone could die.
Where are we going?
Nowhere, i just know it hurts you.
Ca-2 deficiency's a genetic disorder
That scrambles proteins.
If the blood test is positive,
You'll need a bone marrow transplant.
Transplant sounds like a euphemism for slim odds.
Uh, slim but not none.
We're gonna need to test jane for a match.
Don't you have donor banks?
Jane is your best bet.
The procedure's perfectly safe.
There's no risk.
No risk!
Any surgery has...
Then don't tell me there's no risk.
You gonna tell me there's no pain either?
The testing will hurt a little-
I'll be fine.
If she doesn't do this and you don't make it,
She's gonna spend the rest of her life
Blaming herself.
Mom... please.
Find someone else.
Let someone else take the risk.
Donor bank turned up a 49-Year-Old man in cleveland
Who's a five out of six hla match.
First flight out of cleveland leaves at-
Why is a 49-Year-Old cleveland man
A closer match than her daughter?
He may not be.
Maggie didn't let us test her.
- Why not?
- Pain,
Danger, risk of-
The only reason to give multiple reasons
Is your searching for what the person wants to hear.
House.
You were wrong about sainted mommy.
Don't care.
You can forget the donor bank.
There's no ca-2 deficiency.
Best we can do is make her comfortable.
Is that from taub?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Merry christmas.
Who's gonna tell the patient she's dying?
I will.
And nobody leaves here until we find out what killed her.
Whatever she has is fatal.
Makes no difference if it's disease number 58
Or 907.
You guys mad at me?
Nope.
You had no choice.
Of course i had a choice.
You had no choice once i made my choice.
And now i'm choosing not to be mad at you.
Why?
'Cause it'll drive house nuts.
You think that'll make your lives better or worse?
I told my mom i don't care what she thinks.
I want you to test my marrow.
I can't be dying.
Sure, you can.
You're wrong.
You don't even know what i have.
What you have is one last christmas
With your daughter.
One last chance to give her a present-
The truth.
It's inexpensive.
Highly valued.
Never have to stand in line to return it
The day after christmas.
What are you talking about?
A mother who's going to die
Doesn't refuse a donor test because it might hurt.
She refuses when she knows it won't match.
Which tends to happen when mother and daughter
Aren't mother and daughter.
I can do dna tests
If you'd rather keep lying to me.
I never wanted kids.
I love them, but with my genes-
I knew this woman.
A drug addict.
She got pregnant,
Didn't want to have an abortion.
But she also didn't want her daughter to ever know
Who her real mother was.
What she was.
I promised never to tell.
Then a promise to an addict is worth more
Than a promise to your daughter?
It'd be cruel to tell her.
Right.
She lives a lie,
You get to die a hypocrite.
Mom, the doctors told me what's happening.
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
I promise you.
Doctors can be wrong.
There's still a chance i can beat-
Do you really believe that?
I do.
No, mom, you're dying.
Nobody can help you.
It's not going to be okay.
That was cold.
Yeah.
What'd you get for christmas?
I got a watch, a vintage Ip,
And a second-Edition Conan Doyle.
And if that wasn't bad enough,
My patient's dying.
Oh, christmas deaths in a hospital-
There's nothing more depressing.
No one ever wants to go in the patient's room.
Even the candy stripers leave them alone.
But i saw something amazing.
Pure truth.
She told her mother that she was dying.
Stripped her of all hope.
That sounds...
horrible.
It was like watching some bizarre astronomical event
That you know you're never gonna see again.
You tell people the cold, hard truth all the time.
You get off on it.
'Cause i don't care.
She cared.
She did it anyway.
She did it because she cared.
The Angels of Christmas have finally given House
A present he can appreciate.
Well, don't ruin it.
Don't pin this on Christ.
He has got enough nails on him
Patients had to die...
Would you take off that hat.
It's Christmas.
It's a reindeer.
It's a moose on a jew.
Who cares?
Things have their place.
You wouldn't hang dreidels from a christmas tree.
You could.
Things don't care.
No, they don't.
Happy Solstice, House.
* God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen *
* Let Nothing You Dismay *
* Remember Christ Our Savior *
* Was Born On Christmas Day *
* To Save Us All From Satan's Power *
* When We Were Gone Astray... *
Don't you people know holiday spirit?
Bring me the eggnog of good cheer.
House, if you have something to say, say it.
If you don't, give us a chance to get home before Santa.
Scrooge.
Give the patient risperidone.
That's an anti-Psychotic.
She's dying.
She's not crazy.
I am going to perform a christmas miracle.
* Oh, Tidings *
* Of Comfort And Joy *
* Comfort And Joy... * *
You said all the other causes of Osteopetrosis are fatal.
Except for the one we discovered early.
Because it was impossible.
When a fetus forms, it's just a mass of cells.
Breast tissue covers an extensive portion of the body.
As the fetus develops, most of this tissue recedes,
Remaining only in the fun places.
But sometimes extra breast tissue
Is left behind in places where it doesn't belong.
Risperidone does a lot of things.
One is it makes breast tissue swell,
So we can find it more easily.
You're telling me i could have breast cancer...
Somewhere not in my breasts?
That doesn't make sense.
Taub's parents have a winter condo in florida,
But they're still new yorkers.
Actually, my parents- Don't care.
I told a parable.
Now i'm going to raise the dead.
Give me that syringe.
That's gotta be a fat deposit.
Yes, i could be wrong.
If i am, she's dead.
So shut up.
What's that?
Risperidone also causes galactorrhea.
What's that-
Galac-Galactic?
Open your mouth.
Relax, you've had it before.
I am not-
Milk?
Eww!
We'll cut out your mom's tumor and start her on Chemo.
All the rest of your symptoms should go away.
I love you.
I know.
Have a wonderful life.
Energy discharge confirmed
A sudden dispersion of charged particles followed by the requisite disturbance to the ionosphere.
origin has been narrowed to the Amazonian basin.
This is the third time and again from another new location.
No unusual solar flares spotted today.
- The phenomenon is so localized...
- It has to be artificial in origin.
maybe it's an experiment or something.
At any rate, the magnitude of this discharge seems larger than the others.
oh, it is.
Good news is we've managed to get a fix on the origin point.
Here's an image taken from a private satellite approximately five hours ago.
Take a look.
I don't see a thing.
of course, we all know it doesn't take much to alter photos these days.
Right, Cammy?
I'd have to agree there.
And it goes beyond this surveillance photo.
We can't say for certain that all of our data isn't being intercepted and altered as it comes in.
And it's notjust Delta Red that's affected, either.
Whoever's doing this has the wool pulled over the entire world's eyes.
Something is out there.
Something sinister operating from the shadows.
But who could have the connections and reach to pull that off?
Shadaloo, perhaps?
But Shadaloo is history...
Or so they say.
I'm off, then.
The paperwork will have to wait.
That's right.
The man you're looking for went missing three weeks ago.
The family has requested a full investigation, but...
In a small town like this, we simply don't have the manpower...
Of course, I feel sorry for the family, but investigations like that cost money and require personnel.
So, he was famous back home, was he?
You know, he used to come here to give martial arts lessons...
Bottom line?
Word came down from the brass.
my hands are tied.
Is there something going on I should know about?
I mean, Interpol visiting this little burg?
What if I told you this was happening all over the world?
Would that satisfy you?
Judging by the look on your face, I'd say we hit another dead end.
Don't let it get to you.
We're bound to find something eventually.
Boy, you sound like a cop.
Ever consider spending your time offwith your wife?
I thought you gave up police work yourself, and here you are doing this...
Birds of a feather, huh?
You're still not over Charlie, are you?
I only heard about the string of disappearances by coincidence, but I couldn't get it out of my head once I did.
That's when I called you...
Figured you might know something.
Fighters from around the world disappearing seemed to be up your alley.
It all started last year.
Famous martial artists just started vanishing.
The only thing in common is that each is considered the top practitioner in his or her respective art.
That, and no evidence is left behind following any of the abductions.
It'd be easy to assume an open and shut case of kidnapping, but there've been no ransom demands.
That was suspicious enough to get Interpol involved, and that's when I put the badge back on...
Actually, there are forces within Interpol that want this investigation stopped.
They say there's no evidence to link the disappearances.
They consider this a waste of resources.
Well, no naysayer is gonna stop us, right?
once you start talking about fighters from around the world...
Well, thatjust brings a lot of stuff floating back up to the surface.
Like Shadaloo...
There's no evidence that Bison and his men are really dead, though I hope to God they are.
Still, I won't believe it till I see it.
Not after what I've been through.
I know what they're capable of.
They're still alive...
I know it.
And, if they're still alive, they're probably behind this, right?
I understand your disappointment, sir.
I'm sorry.
No matter...
This weapon's value won't become evident until we manage to shrink it down and make it commercially viable.
For now, lets consider this but a preview to drum up interest.
Let it bring people to our little party.
Loosen their pocketbooks a bit.
Don't you agree?
Well, ifwe're to perfect the device, we'll need him.
I know this one.
He practices an art that was initially developed for assassination.
But there should be another that is even more powerful than him.
We aren't after him for his fighting style...
You see, if our theories are correct, he possesses a power within that, if awakened, eclipses even that ofthe other.
That power is called Satsui no Hado.
And this power would allow us to bring the BLECE project to fruition?
- Yes, sir.
- Satsui no Hado...
The murderous intent...
Interesting...
At ten, you have the usual management meeting.
VP of European operations has a teleconference scheduled for 11:30.
Representatives from the Pacific Rim exposition will be here...
I'm sure you're busy Mr. Masters, but allow me to introduce myself.
My name's Maya.
I'm a freelance journalist.
I'm sorry, but all interviews must be scheduled in advance.
I'd like to get a comment regarding the rising price of crude oil.
What's the Masters Group doing to combat this?
Didn't you hear the lady?
No appointment, no interview.
Ken Masters, the greatest American fighter and top dog of the business world.
I have to say, Mr. Masters, I had you pegged all wrong.
I wouldn't have expected you to get so worked up over a sudden visitor.
I thought fighters were supposed to be more laid-back.
That's cute...
You're not used to rejection, are you?
I wonder if your friend Ryu is in the habit of turning people away if they don't have an appointment.
You may have studied alongside him, but I'd say you're worlds apart.
I'll be going now.
I'll be sure to make an appointment next time so your precious rules are protected.
Ryu...
What are you up to these days, friend?
Still lost in your own head?
We both knew that our last battle wouldn't be the one to settle the score.
That fight can only take place once we've both truly found ourselves.
I know that the Satsui no Hado lurks within you like cancer, tempting you to throw away your humanity for unlimited power.
But you manage to make even that burden almost noble.
You know, Ryu, I have trouble even relating to you as a fighter these days.
I'm in a whole different world now.
Career...
Family...
Don't get me wrong, it's not like they're a burden.
Still, the more I live this life, the more I forget what it means to be a warrior.
Time just keeps passing and I feel like I'm running in place.
Listen to me go on about my stupid problems...
Whatever...
What's the point?
I suppose I've always seemed kinda trivial to a guy like you, Ryu.
After all, I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
I didn't have to work for this.
It's me.
About today's schedule...
Squeeze in as much as you can.
I'm ready to work.
I think we got it.
This is definitely where the energy discharge took place.
So they did alter the images...
This isn't a natural depression, that's for sure.
Looks like something heavy was sitting here.
And, jeez, look at all the dead animals, eh?
Bag them up.
Let's take a few corpses for analysis.
Captain!
What's the matter?
The ground here felt a bit soft, so I thought I'd do some digging to see why...
Oh, God!
Human bodies...
How long must you continue to resist, boy?
Until my last breath!
Why do you resist the power within?
I don't desire power!
I have my sights set higher than that!
What is it you seek, then?
Ah, but you have no answer.
Seeking anything but power is foolishness of the highest order!
The blood flowing through your veins calls out to you.
Answer it!
Answer it with your life!
No!
Then I shall murder you myself!
This mundane world is of no concern to us!
We grow stronger by consuming human life!
Enough!
I don't know anything about my birth.
My earliest memories are of master Goutetsu and master Gouken.
I remember Akuma training with them.
He was strong.
Stronger than the others.
All he cared about was power.
Then, one day...
he murdered master Gouken.
I must defeat Akuma!
However, I can't allow myself to become like him in the process.
But what can I do!
?
All my blood and sweat and training brings me no closer to finding my true purpose!
Keeping my urges under control takes all the power I can muster!
I don't know how long I can resist!
Ken!
I'll just be a minute.
Oh, thanks.
You're Eliza masters...
I interviewed your husband the other day.
He's a great man.
You saw Ken?
How was he?
Did he seem to be in good spirits?
I mean, he's just been so busy lately.
I don't really get to see him so much.
Yeah...
You feel like a cup of coffee or something?
Just us girls?
Delta Red is on the case.
There's a series of large scale secret experiments occurring all over the world.
Yeah, Cammy hasn't changed a bit...
That's right.
We found ten so far.
And it gets worse.
The victims' identities came as quite a surprise.
And a surprise it was.
I don't know how or why, but the fighters we're tracking down ended up dead.
They'd been abandoned in a shallow grave in the middle of a jungle.
But Cammy didn'tjust call to give us a shock.
Even if they determined the bodies to be those of the missing fighters, not even Delta Red intelligence can figure outjust how they got there.
The big picture is still a mystery.
Cammy...
About those animal corpses you collected...
We've examined them thoroughly and this is just incredible.
- Never seen anything li...
- Get on with it.
OK...
Are you ready for this?
Some of the victims' cells seem to have actually exploded.
It's as if the moisture inside of them was suddenly heated, causing it to boil.
It's...
It's freaky stuff!
I just...
I haven't actually reported this up the chain of command just yet.
For some reason...
I get the feeling it'd be swept under the rug if I did.
The Army and the fbi are suspiciously reluctant to help.
I don't have connections in the CIA, but I imagine they're in the same boat.
If even Interpol and Delta Red's intelligence is being manipulated and controlled behind the scenes, there must be a huge organization responsible for all this.
To tell the truth...
We did have an investigation going at one point.
I even had some leads...
But...
We'll get to the bottom of this!
Too many people have been hurt already!
Oh, what a beautiful doll, madam.
Thank you.
Isn't itjust adorable?
A friend gave it to me.
She's a journalist.
Well, I bet your husband will think it's cute as a button.
He's so busy these days, I hardly ever see him.
Still...
We should talk soon.
Contact your boss.
Right now!
I've got a message for him.
I don't appreciate being toyed with.
You're gonna have to show a little more faith.
You are regarded as a capable soldier.
Is my speaking directly to you not sufficient to show my trust in you?
If you do trust me, you'll call off your lapdogs and let me operate in peace so I can concentrate.
I can do that.
But are you sure you're barking up the right tree?
I distinctly recall ordering you to track down Ryu, not Ken masters.
The time it would take to blindly search for a wandering vagabond like Ryu is a luxury I can't afford.
The fact that you have so many others on the case tells me you're aware of that much.
What we have to do is wait for him to show up.
If he's going to stay in touch with anyone, it's masters.
Their friendship and rivalry run deep.
I'm sorry, friend.
If I'd have died before you, perhaps my body could have sustained you a bit longer.
All of mankind holds a power within.
The power of life.
This force is fragile, but eternal...
Life begets more life and the cycle continues.
This force, this power is what drives it all.
But what is power?
Looks like an ordinary ruined castle at first glance, but security's too tight for that to be the case.
Only one way to find out for sure...
Look!
That's the missing American karate champ!
That's enough!
Sonic...
Boom!
Hey!
What is this place, anyway?
Looks like a laboratory, but what are they researching?
They're onto us.
We'd better move.
Alright.
Let's go...
- Chun-Li!
- Gimme a sec.
So we lost another one...
Just what was going on there, anyway?
And who's responsible?
Clearly, these fighters are being used in some kind of strange experiments.
"Boiling Liquid Expanding Cell Explosion... "
"BLECE."
Exploding cells?
Scads of dead animals in the Amazon exhibiting that sort of damage.
I'm no scientist.
This stuff's way over my head.
Do you suppose there's a connection to the missing fighters?
Oh, my God...
- Ryu!
?
- What!
?
"It can be postulated that the completion of the BLECE project hinges on the system harnessing the Satsui no Hado, a power that lies dormant in this particular subject.
Without him and his power, BLECE can never achieve its full potential... "
Harnessing the Satsui no Hado?
madness...
Well, at least we know now that Ryu is going to be their next target.
Let's get moving.
We have find him before they do.
But how do are we supposed to find him?
He never stays in one place for long.
Well, if anyone knows where Ryu is...
- It's Ken!
- That's right!
I bet he can find him!
Wait...
What ifwe're not the only ones to come to that conclusion?
Hey, baby.
For a second there, I thought my secretary followed me home.
What's up?
You OK?
Never mind.
You look so tired...
You know, we really haven't talked lately, have we?
I'm sorry, baby.
I haven't forgotten about you.
Well...
Who are you trying to forget then?
You...
The you standing in front of me right now...
You're not the Ken Masters I fell in love with.
When I first met you, you used to be so laid back and carefree.
You were always smiling, but you've changed.
You've gotten so melancholy, so serious.
It's almost like you're trying to chase someone out of your heart.
Tell me what's going on.
I think you give me way too much credit.
I was never carefree.
I was always serious.
Is that what you really want to say?
No...
I just...
Stay here.
Who's there?
- What is wrong with you people?
- What the...
Sakura!
?
That was a pretty rude welcome.
I came all this way to see you, but, seriously,
I got treated like a common burglar or something.
And, by the way, they so started it!
Well, I should hope so!
That's what I pay them for!
You did sneak in, you know.
Oh, God, I am uptight.
I ran straight here from the airport, so I'm later than I'd expected.
I think you should hire some stronger security guards, dontcha think?
But I guess this place is pretty safe since you're here, Ken-san.
Anyway, to what do I owe the pleasure of your unannounced visit, Sakura?
Well...
I'm trying to track Ryu-san down.
- Ryu?
- Please tell me where he is!
Look, I don't know where he is.
I figure his stalker oughtta know better than anyone.
Well, I don't.
That's why I came here.
So deal.
So...
Why do you need to see him all of a sudden?
Hello?
From Chun-Li?
Put her through.
Hey!
Long time no see.
What's up?
You're calling pretty late.
Oh, you did?
Sorry.
I've been really busy lately.
I told my secretary to only let business calls through.
I'm at home.
Yeah?
You're looking for Ryu?
I've got no idea.
Here?
Now?
No, it's cool.
You can come by, but...
I'm a little busy right now.
We'll talk when you arrive.
Apparently, I'm Ryu's personal assistant now.
- Ken-san?
- Yeah?
Have you heard about the disappearances?
- The fighters being kidnapped?
- What?
So you haven't heard.
Famous martial artists from all over the world are vanishing.
You really didn't know about it?
I figured all fighters would have heard about it by now.
I've just been so busy lately...
Tell me all about it!
What's going on!
?
What have we got here?
You some kinda karateman or somethin'?
Yeah...
Something like that.
I thought so.
You know, I've got a friend who's into that.
He lives around here.
You know him?
- He's the US karate champ.
- Actually, I do know him.
We've sparred before.
Your friend is quite a fighter.
Sure is.
It wasn't enough to help him...
He went missing, all of a sudden, last year.
Haven't heard from him since.
Left behind a young wife.
She moved on.
Found a new man and got the heck outta Dodge.
I haven't given up lookin' for him, though.
I really don't know all the details.
No one knows what happened to the victims or where they are.
The rumorjust started circulating pretty recently.
From what I hear, the disappearances started last year.
All the victims are really famous.
No amateurs.
Everybody's talking about it lately.
It's big news.
I hadn't heard...
That's not true I just wasn't listening.
Dammit!
That must be what Chun-Li was getting at on the phone.
If she's involved, this is no ordinary kidnapping case.
Something's up.
That's why I'm so worried about Ryu-san.
I don't know where he is or what he's up to or anything.
He's my friend, too.
Chun-Li and the others should be here soon.
We can figure out what to do when they arrive.
Looks like I won't be in the office for a while.
It's me.
A truck driver? "Karateman"?
Ryu gave him my number?
OK, Put him through.
Yeah.
That's right.
This is Ken masters.
So you're looking for your missing friend and Ryu told you that I might know something, right?
So where did you meet Ryu, anyway?
I've located Ryu.
Get everything ready.
Begin preparations for plan B, just in case.
Chun-Li?
Listen, we found out where Ryu is.
Turns out, he's a lot closer than you'd think.
What am I doing here?
I guess the nostalgia of hearing about a former opponent got the better of me.
And now here I am chasing ghosts...
He left his family behind when he disappeared.
I couldn't imagine him doing something like that.
- Who are you?
- So we finally meet face to face.
I'd like to test your abilities, if you don't mind.
I suppose you're feeling a little confused right now.
I would be.
But I've known about you for a long time.
I was really hoping to meet you under better circumstances.
Oh, well!
Such power...
You're no ordinary fighter!
Tatsumaki!
Well?
Having fun?
Ready to show me what you can really do?
Hold it right there!
Don't fight her.
She's testing you.
Trying to bring out your true power...
I don't know who you are, but I know what you want.
Cammy, stop!
She's too strong for you.
What!
?
Quite a fashion statement, no?
There's only one like it.
And it's mine.
There's a lot at stake here.
I'll do what I have to to win.
Cammy, wait!
What'll it be, Ryu?
This poor girl's about to die.
Aren't you going to save her?
Don't do it!
If you fight now... make your choice!
This is it.
It's happening!
my God, he's gonna kill me.
So this is the Satsui no Hado...
Beautiful...
His power's off the charts.
He can't be captured in this state.
At least I got some data for analysis...
Ryu!
I know you!
Oh, no...
Ryu!
Stop!
No!
No, Ryu-san!
Stop it!
Cammy!
Cammy, are you OK?
It's me.
Dispatch a helicopter immediately.
We have a man down.
She's in bad shape.
Hurry!
Cammy's condition has stabilized.
Luckily, none of her vital organs were injured.
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have let her go ahead of us by herself.
oK...
Tell me everything you guys have figured out so far.
We managed to get our hands on a research brief detailing a new weapon.
The report is addressed to an emerging arms manufacturing corporation
- called S.I.N.
- S.I.N.?
I've heard of them.
They've grown like a weed for the past few years, but there's all sorts of rumors linking them to crime syndicates.
I'm pretty sure their ceo is named Seth...
Seth... something.
This is S.I.N.'s latest weapon.
It's codenamed BLECE.
The weapon isn't chemical, biological or nuclear.
It's powered by energy found within the human body.
This spiritual energy is what you might call "Ki. "
The BLECE device provides a method of harnessing human energy to cause a cyclical chain reaction...
This energy is artificially extracted from the subject and amplified via the device.
The resultant pulse resonates within the victim, causing the mitochondria to overflow with excess kinetic energy.
The moisture within living tissue begins to boil, causing an expansion that detonates the cells from within.
What a fantastic invention it is.
It uses the energy inside living things against the very form of life from whence it came.
It's clean.
It's simple.
It's... elegant.
When this device is shrunken down for commercial manufacturing, it will only become a bigger threat.
once miniaturized, the device can actually be implanted inside subjects, allowing them to harness their ki to cause massive destructive effects.
The subject can easily plant themselves into any crowd and be undetected.
The implications this could have on terrorism are frightening.
It can be thought of as a way to augment the natural ki energy we all hold within.
Essentially, it could give anyone powers that resemble the Satsui no Hado.
A new breed of undetectable assassins will rain destruction down upon civilization.
The missing fighters were used as guinea pigs for their research.
Their mastery of ki made them the perfect fodder for their tests.
S.I.N.'s goal is to get their hands on Ryu, who they regard as the ultimate test subject.
I cannot overstate my supreme disappointment.
You had Ryu in your sights, yet you come back to me without even a single shred of data to further our research.
Betrayal saddens me.
How do you suppose I should deal with this sadness... maya, was it?
Plan B was devised precisely for situations such as this.
That said, the plan will require a few adjustments.
Ifwe cause the Satsui no Hado to manifest itself in Ryu again, we won't be able to touch him.
We know that now.
Therefore, I propose that the ceo himself grace us with his participation.
You strike me as a curious man.
I'm sure you'd like a chance to see what Ryu is capable of firsthand.
And how are you today, Ken masters?
That voice...
You're that maya woman.
You remembered!
I'm honored.
Listen, I'm planning a fabulous party aboard a boat.
You'll be there, won't you?
Cut the games.
Who are you?
Why did you fight Ryu?
Do you work for S.I.N.?
So, you'll come?
I mean, your wife's here already.
may as well join her, right?
Eliza!
?
No...
I didn't even notice she was gone.
Tell me what you want!
It's yours!
What I want?
Quit screwing around!
You kidnapped her!
I know it!
She wouldn't just leave without telling me!
You're just a little know-it-all, aren't you?
How well do you really know your wife?
How many hours did you spend talking with her this week?
Or would minutes be more appropriate?
Didn't you notice anything on your mantle that wasn't there before?
Cute doll, isn't it?
- What are you getting at?
- Your wife is my guest, Ken masters.
She came here of her own free will.
Fine.
So I just have to show up at your little shindig, right?
- That's all you want?
- Well, that's not all I want.
You're going to bring Ryu along for the festivities.
Do I make myself clear?
Dammit.
They want Ryu in exchange for Eliza.
No!
If I hadn't beaten up your security guards...
It's not your fault.
This one is all me.
So what's the plan?
I doubt the police would be any use to us.
And we can'tjust hand Ryu over to them.
You got that right!
Ryu isn't going anywhere!
I'll rescue Eliza myself!
No...
I'll go.
- Ryu...
- If they're after my power, then the only way to put a stop to their plan is to keep it under control.
Right in front of them, so they know I can do it.
- Can you pull that off?
- You just worry about Eliza.
Sounds good.
You can count on our help, too.
Have a seat.
You tricked me.
Hold it right there.
Who are you two?
The agency sent us to help with the party.
We're the entertainment.
Hey, wait a second.
Sure this ain't some mistake?
Didn't hear nothing about hiring girls.
- The only mistake...
- Is you two...
Not knowing when to shut up!
Well, then...
- Ready for a little extra credit?
- Yeah!
I called in a favor to an old Coast Guard buddy.
Help is on the way.
In the meantime, teach those goons a lesson!
Let's split up.
I'll go after Eliza.
You take care of the bad guys.
I'll be fine here on my own.
You two go join the others.
Well, look what the cat dragged in...
I suppose whoever's fighting the guards right now are the same ones who stole the data from our facility?
Not that I care, mind you.
No matter who else you brought with you, my intuition tells me that Ryu's here.
That's all that matters.
- Where's Eliza?
- Take a hike, blondie.
I don't need you anymore.
- Where is Eliza!
?
- Out of my way!
C'mon!
I'll beat an answer out of you!
Your wife is right inside that room.
Ryu might possess an incredible power, but you're no slouch yourself.
Good luck, mr. masters.
Sorry to keep you waiting, babe.
Took a little while to get dressed.
Love the red.
That outfit always did look great on you.
Let's go.
This place gives me the creeps.
Is it ok for me to exert myself like that?
I mean, would running hurt the baby?
When did you find out?
Jeez, I didn't even know...
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to surprise you.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's my fault for not giving you a chance to bring it up.
Hell of a sense of timing you got there, though.
I love you so much, Eliza.
I just realized the strength that can come from wanting to protect someone you love.
I guess that's my special power.
I don't need Satsui no Hado or anything else.
Not when I have so much to look forward to.
You're gonna be a godfather, Ryu!
A good portion of life is spent wondering "why".
There are all manner of things that defy understanding.
Most of the time, it is difficult to determine where to begin looking for reason.
No matter the circumstances, your presence here was not inevitable.
on top of that, my presence here was far from a foregone conclusion.
Yet here we are.
Why do you suppose that is?
My apologies for the late introduction...
I... am Seth.
I understand, Ryu.
I know why we are here.
You see, I simply could not resist the chance to test out the legendary power you possess, myself.
You struggle against the temptation of that power.
Oh, it must be torture.
Ryu!
Ryu!
Ryu-san!
Sho...
Ryu...
Ken!
Still, some questions must be asked, some situations faced head on.
Surely you, who are most at home in the ring, find this power inside to be a great temptation...
And yet you struggle in vain against it even as it seeks to control you utterly.
Why do you fight it?
Why!
?
Keep it inside and you will die!
Your death'll garner nothing.
It'll be without meaning!
Stay back!
Power only has meaning if it is put into action.
It defines you.
Power like that is what rules the world!
Everyone seeks power, seeks to grow in strength.
But this goal is out of reach of ordinary men.
The poor seek riches, the ugly, beauty.
We compare ourselves to others and seek to cover our own inadequacies to find peace of mind.
The mere existence of those who are better than us becomes intolerable.
We fight in retaliation!
If beauty is not enough, we use money.
If money does not work, we resort to violence.
This energy is what powers our world!
It is essential.
All I seek is to help this natural process along!
This destructive force begotten from conflict, this power that everyone lusts for,
I will spread it over the world with but a touch.
It is like a well that can never run dry.
A precious mineral flowing from an inexhaustible mine!
This power will be mine.
Stubborn mule...
You avert your eyes from the power within and refuse to fight.
That may offer you a modicum of empty solace when faced with your pitiful frailty, but no more.
Pathetic.
Despite the power you possess, you will become a disposable test subject no different from the others.
I'm not through fighting.
And I do not run from the power I hold within.
I, too, seek strength.
That's what has driven me all this way.
And yet I never truly understood just what power is.
Or what it means to be strong.
Your words did help me to understand one thing.
The power I seek is nothing like what you describe.
The power humans possess, that is the source of and destination for all of life.
The power you're after is the opposite of this.
It can only destroy that which is good.
To seek it invites your own demise.
That is why I fight!
I fight to rid the world of such diabolical power.
I'll show you what true strength is!
It is the courage to stand up in the face of evil and emerge victorious.
What is this nonsense?
Power is power.
There is no difference!
Here's your answer.
Let go!
What have you done?
No...
What... is this... power?
!
How...
How could this happen?
You actually hurt me... my body!
They're getting away!
Hope your insurance is paid up!
Ryu!
This is the US Coast Guard.
Your are suspected of having entered this harbor without permission.
Prepare for a compulsory search of your vessel.
Passengers and crew should stand by for further instructions.
Oh, my God...
Shadaloo!
I bring you a message from Lord Bison.
You put on a fantastic show.
Y
He's been watching you all along.
He has another message for you, as well.
S.I.N.'s success has come only through the manipulation of Shadaloo working behind the scenes to ensure your good fortune.
He wanted you to know that.
Ken.
Did you see that?
I...
I saw it alright, bro!
That was amazing.
You really let your true power shine through.
I can feel it in you too, Ken.
This... power...
Thanks for coming to see me off, Ken-san.
I really wanted to stick around until Ryu-san gets better, but tickets are really cheap right now, so I had to jump at the chance.
I am a student, you know.
I'm not made of money.
Oh, that's right.
My friend gave me some chocolates she got on her trip to Hawaii.
Want some?
They're really good.
Even with all that evidence, we're right back where we started.
The cover-up is so vast, even the dispatch of the Coast Guard has been officially denied.
It feels like we're being treated as the enemy instead of the real threat.
The abduction and murder of the fighters, the connection to Shadaloo...
- It all goes unpunished...
- The evil is still out there.
Bison...
You may think you have the upper hand, but the truth is that S.I.N. has been manipulating Shadaloo.
Fool.
It's me.
About that new power Ryu displayed for us the other day...
Say no more.
I'll resume the search right away, sir.
Excellent job, Crimson Viper.
Your report was more than satisfactory.
Keep this up and we should know everything there is to know about S.I.N.'s activities.
Undercover work is no picnic, and we know you've been through hell already.
But there is simply no one else as suited to this job as you.
Please understand.
once the CIA has the information we need, we can bring S.I.N. to justice.
Don't worry about me, sir.
I understand my mission.
What's the matter, Ryu?
It's just that bird...
Looks like he got separated from the flock.
Yeah... maybe...
I guess this is goodbye.
Thanks.
But why are you headed out to train, anyway?
I mean, you've already proven you can keep the Satsui no Hado under control.
That may have been an exception.
I'm not sure I can do it every time.
It took an incredible amount of concentration.
I'm still nowhere near finished with my training.
I guess there's no arguing with you.
Go if you have to.
Go to places the rest of us can only dream of.
I wish you well.
Thanks.
And, don't worry, we'll meet again.
I'm looking forward to seeing how strong you've become by then.
You and I may travel down different roads, but our life-force is one and the same.
I'm sure our paths will lead to the same destination.
oh, we will meet again i guarantee it
By backfire
A sudden dispersion of charged particles followed by the requisite disturbance to the ionosphere.
origin has been narrowed to the Amazonian basin.
This is the third time and again from another new location.
No unusual solar flares spotted today.
- The phenomenon is so localized...
- It has to be artificial in origin.
maybe it's an experiment or something.
At any rate, the magnitude of this discharge seems larger than the others.
oh, it is.
Good news is we've managed to get a fix on the origin point.
Here's an image taken from a private satellite approximately five hours ago.
Take a look.
I don't see a thing.
of course, we all know it doesn't take much to alter photos these days.
Right, Cammy?
I'd have to agree there.
And it goes beyond this surveillance photo.
We can't say for certain that all of our data isn't being intercepted and altered as it comes in.
And it's notjust Delta Red that's affected, either.
Whoever's doing this has the wool pulled over the entire world's eyes.
Something is out there.
Something sinister operating from the shadows.
But who could have the connections and reach to pull that off?
Shadaloo, perhaps?
But Shadaloo is history...
Or so they say.
I'm off, then.
The paperwork will have to wait.
That's right.
The man you're looking for went missing three weeks ago.
The family has requested a full investigation, but...
In a small town like this, we simply don't have the manpower...
Of course, I feel sorry for the family, but investigations like that cost money and require personnel.
So, he was famous back home, was he?
You know, he used to come here to give martial arts lessons...
Bottom line?
Word came down from the brass.
my hands are tied.
Is there something going on I should know about?
I mean, Interpol visiting this little burg?
What if I told you this was happening all over the world?
Would that satisfy you?
Judging by the look on your face, I'd say we hit another dead end.
Don't let it get to you.
We're bound to find something eventually.
Boy, you sound like a cop.
Ever consider spending your time offwith your wife?
I thought you gave up police work yourself, and here you are doing this...
Birds of a feather, huh?
You're still not over Charlie, are you?
I only heard about the string of disappearances by coincidence, but I couldn't get it out of my head once I did.
That's when I called you...
Figured you might know something.
Fighters from around the world disappearing seemed to be up your alley.
It all started last year.
Famous martial artists just started vanishing.
The only thing in common is that each is considered the top practitioner in his or her respective art.
That, and no evidence is left behind following any of the abductions.
It'd be easy to assume an open and shut case of kidnapping, but there've been no ransom demands.
That was suspicious enough to get Interpol involved, and that's when I put the badge back on...
Actually, there are forces within Interpol that want this investigation stopped.
They say there's no evidence to link the disappearances.
They consider this a waste of resources.
Well, no naysayer is gonna stop us, right?
once you start talking about fighters from around the world...
Well, thatjust brings a lot of stuff floating back up to the surface.
Like Shadaloo...
There's no evidence that Bison and his men are really dead, though I hope to God they are.
Still, I won't believe it till I see it.
Not after what I've been through.
I know what they're capable of.
They're still alive...
I know it.
And, if they're still alive, they're probably behind this, right?
I understand your disappointment, sir.
I'm sorry.
No matter...
This weapon's value won't become evident until we manage to shrink it down and make it commercially viable.
For now, lets consider this but a preview to drum up interest.
Let it bring people to our little party.
Loosen their pocketbooks a bit.
Don't you agree?
Well, ifwe're to perfect the device, we'll need him.
I know this one.
He practices an art that was initially developed for assassination.
But there should be another that is even more powerful than him.
We aren't after him for his fighting style...
You see, if our theories are correct, he possesses a power within that, if awakened, eclipses even that ofthe other.
That power is called Satsui no Hado.
And this power would allow us to bring the BLECE project to fruition?
- Yes, sir.
- Satsui no Hado...
The murderous intent...
Interesting...
At ten, you have the usual management meeting.
VP of European operations has a teleconference scheduled for 11:30.
Representatives from the Pacific Rim exposition will be here...
I'm sure you're busy Mr. Masters, but allow me to introduce myself.
My name's Maya.
I'm a freelance journalist.
I'm sorry, but all interviews must be scheduled in advance.
I'd like to get a comment regarding the rising price of crude oil.
What's the Masters Group doing to combat this?
Didn't you hear the lady?
No appointment, no interview.
Ken Masters, the greatest American fighter and top dog of the business world.
I have to say, Mr. Masters, I had you pegged all wrong.
I wouldn't have expected you to get so worked up over a sudden visitor.
I thought fighters were supposed to be more laid-back.
That's cute...
You're not used to rejection, are you?
I wonder if your friend Ryu is in the habit of turning people away if they don't have an appointment.
You may have studied alongside him, but I'd say you're worlds apart.
I'll be going now.
I'll be sure to make an appointment next time so your precious rules are protected.
Ryu...
What are you up to these days, friend?
Still lost in your own head?
We both knew that our last battle wouldn't be the one to settle the score.
That fight can only take place once we've both truly found ourselves.
I know that the Satsui no Hado lurks within you like cancer, tempting you to throw away your humanity for unlimited power.
But you manage to make even that burden almost noble.
You know, Ryu, I have trouble even relating to you as a fighter these days.
I'm in a whole different world now.
Career...
Family...
Don't get me wrong, it's not like they're a burden.
Still, the more I live this life, the more I forget what it means to be a warrior.
Time just keeps passing and I feel like I'm running in place.
Listen to me go on about my stupid problems...
Whatever...
What's the point?
I suppose I've always seemed kinda trivial to a guy like you, Ryu.
After all, I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
I didn't have to work for this.
It's me.
About today's schedule...
Squeeze in as much as you can.
I'm ready to work.
I think we got it.
This is definitely where the energy discharge took place.
So they did alter the images...
This isn't a natural depression, that's for sure.
Looks like something heavy was sitting here.
And, jeez, look at all the dead animals, eh?
Bag them up.
Let's take a few corpses for analysis.
Captain!
What's the matter?
The ground here felt a bit soft, so I thought I'd do some digging to see why...
Oh, God!
Human bodies...
How long must you continue to resist, boy?
Until my last breath!
Why do you resist the power within?
I don't desire power!
I have my sights set higher than that!
What is it you seek, then?
Ah, but you have no answer.
Seeking anything but power is foolishness of the highest order!
The blood flowing through your veins calls out to you.
Answer it!
Answer it with your life!
No!
Then I shall murder you myself!
This mundane world is of no concern to us!
We grow stronger by consuming human life!
Enough!
I don't know anything about my birth.
My earliest memories are of master Goutetsu and master Gouken.
I remember Akuma training with them.
He was strong.
Stronger than the others.
All he cared about was power.
Then, one day...
he murdered master Gouken.
I must defeat Akuma!
However, I can't allow myself to become like him in the process.
But what can I do!
?
All my blood and sweat and training brings me no closer to finding my true purpose!
Keeping my urges under control takes all the power I can muster!
I don't know how long I can resist!
Ken!
I'll just be a minute.
Oh, thanks.
You're Eliza masters...
I interviewed your husband the other day.
He's a great man.
You saw Ken?
How was he?
Did he seem to be in good spirits?
I mean, he's just been so busy lately.
I don't really get to see him so much.
Yeah...
You feel like a cup of coffee or something?
Just us girls?
Delta Red is on the case.
There's a series of large scale secret experiments occurring all over the world.
Yeah, Cammy hasn't changed a bit...
That's right.
We found ten so far.
And it gets worse.
The victims' identities came as quite a surprise.
And a surprise it was.
I don't know how or why, but the fighters we're tracking down ended up dead.
They'd been abandoned in a shallow grave in the middle of a jungle.
But Cammy didn'tjust call to give us a shock.
Even if they determined the bodies to be those of the missing fighters, not even Delta Red intelligence can figure outjust how they got there.
The big picture is still a mystery.
Cammy...
About those animal corpses you collected...
We've examined them thoroughly and this is just incredible.
- Never seen anything li...
- Get on with it.
OK...
Are you ready for this?
Some of the victims' cells seem to have actually exploded.
It's as if the moisture inside of them was suddenly heated, causing it to boil.
It's...
It's freaky stuff!
I just...
I haven't actually reported this up the chain of command just yet.
For some reason...
I get the feeling it'd be swept under the rug if I did.
The Army and the fbi are suspiciously reluctant to help.
I don't have connections in the CIA, but I imagine they're in the same boat.
If even Interpol and Delta Red's intelligence is being manipulated and controlled behind the scenes, there must be a huge organization responsible for all this.
To tell the truth...
We did have an investigation going at one point.
I even had some leads...
But...
We'll get to the bottom of this!
Too many people have been hurt already!
Oh, what a beautiful doll, madam.
Thank you.
Isn't itjust adorable?
A friend gave it to me.
She's a journalist.
Well, I bet your husband will think it's cute as a button.
He's so busy these days, I hardly ever see him.
Still...
We should talk soon.
Contact your boss.
Right now!
I've got a message for him.
I don't appreciate being toyed with.
You're gonna have to show a little more faith.
You are regarded as a capable soldier.
Is my speaking directly to you not sufficient to show my trust in you?
If you do trust me, you'll call off your lapdogs and let me operate in peace so I can concentrate.
I can do that.
But are you sure you're barking up the right tree?
I distinctly recall ordering you to track down Ryu, not Ken masters.
The time it would take to blindly search for a wandering vagabond like Ryu is a luxury I can't afford.
The fact that you have so many others on the case tells me you're aware of that much.
What we have to do is wait for him to show up.
If he's going to stay in touch with anyone, it's masters.
Their friendship and rivalry run deep.
I'm sorry, friend.
If I'd have died before you, perhaps my body could have sustained you a bit longer.
All of mankind holds a power within.
The power of life.
This force is fragile, but eternal...
Life begets more life and the cycle continues.
This force, this power is what drives it all.
But what is power?
Looks like an ordinary ruined castle at first glance, but security's too tight for that to be the case.
Only one way to find out for sure...
Look!
That's the missing American karate champ!
That's enough!
Sonic...
Boom!
Hey!
What is this place, anyway?
Looks like a laboratory, but what are they researching?
They're onto us.
We'd better move.
Alright.
Let's go...
- Chun-Li!
- Gimme a sec.
So we lost another one...
Just what was going on there, anyway?
And who's responsible?
Clearly, these fighters are being used in some kind of strange experiments.
"Boiling Liquid Expanding Cell Explosion... "
"BLECE."
Exploding cells?
Scads of dead animals in the Amazon exhibiting that sort of damage.
I'm no scientist.
This stuff's way over my head.
Do you suppose there's a connection to the missing fighters?
Oh, my God...
- Ryu!
?
- What!
?
"It can be postulated that the completion of the BLECE project hinges on the system harnessing the Satsui no Hado, a power that lies dormant in this particular subject.
Without him and his power, BLECE can never achieve its full potential... "
Harnessing the Satsui no Hado?
madness...
Well, at least we know now that Ryu is going to be their next target.
Let's get moving.
We have find him before they do.
But how do are we supposed to find him?
He never stays in one place for long.
Well, if anyone knows where Ryu is...
- It's Ken!
- That's right!
I bet he can find him!
Wait...
What ifwe're not the only ones to come to that conclusion?
Hey, baby.
For a second there, I thought my secretary followed me home.
What's up?
You OK?
Never mind.
You look so tired...
You know, we really haven't talked lately, have we?
I'm sorry, baby.
I haven't forgotten about you.
Well...
Who are you trying to forget then?
You...
The you standing in front of me right now...
You're not the Ken Masters I fell in love with.
When I first met you, you used to be so laid back and carefree.
You were always smiling, but you've changed.
You've gotten so melancholy, so serious.
It's almost like you're trying to chase someone out of your heart.
Tell me what's going on.
I think you give me way too much credit.
I was never carefree.
I was always serious.
Is that what you really want to say?
No...
I just...
Stay here.
Who's there?
- What is wrong with you people?
- What the...
Sakura!
?
That was a pretty rude welcome.
I came all this way to see you, but, seriously,
I got treated like a common burglar or something.
And, by the way, they so started it!
Well, I should hope so!
That's what I pay them for!
You did sneak in, you know.
Oh, God, I am uptight.
I ran straight here from the airport, so I'm later than I'd expected.
I think you should hire some stronger security guards, dontcha think?
But I guess this place is pretty safe since you're here, Ken-san.
Anyway, to what do I owe the pleasure of your unannounced visit, Sakura?
Well...
I'm trying to track Ryu-san down.
- Ryu?
- Please tell me where he is!
Look, I don't know where he is.
I figure his stalker oughtta know better than anyone.
Well, I don't.
That's why I came here.
So deal.
So...
Why do you need to see him all of a sudden?
Hello?
From Chun-Li?
Put her through.
Hey!
Long time no see.
What's up?
You're calling pretty late.
Oh, you did?
Sorry.
I've been really busy lately.
I told my secretary to only let business calls through.
I'm at home.
Yeah?
You're looking for Ryu?
I've got no idea.
Here?
Now?
No, it's cool.
You can come by, but...
I'm a little busy right now.
We'll talk when you arrive.
Apparently, I'm Ryu's personal assistant now.
- Ken-san?
- Yeah?
Have you heard about the disappearances?
- The fighters being kidnapped?
- What?
So you haven't heard.
Famous martial artists from all over the world are vanishing.
You really didn't know about it?
I figured all fighters would have heard about it by now.
I've just been so busy lately...
Tell me all about it!
What's going on!
?
What have we got here?
You some kinda karateman or somethin'?
Yeah...
Something like that.
I thought so.
You know, I've got a friend who's into that.
He lives around here.
You know him?
- He's the US karate champ.
- Actually, I do know him.
We've sparred before.
Your friend is quite a fighter.
Sure is.
It wasn't enough to help him...
He went missing, all of a sudden, last year.
Haven't heard from him since.
Left behind a young wife.
She moved on.
Found a new man and got the heck outta Dodge.
I haven't given up lookin' for him, though.
I really don't know all the details.
No one knows what happened to the victims or where they are.
The rumorjust started circulating pretty recently.
From what I hear, the disappearances started last year.
All the victims are really famous.
No amateurs.
Everybody's talking about it lately.
It's big news.
I hadn't heard...
That's not true I just wasn't listening.
Dammit!
That must be what Chun-Li was getting at on the phone.
If she's involved, this is no ordinary kidnapping case.
Something's up.
That's why I'm so worried about Ryu-san.
I don't know where he is or what he's up to or anything.
He's my friend, too.
Chun-Li and the others should be here soon.
We can figure out what to do when they arrive.
Looks like I won't be in the office for a while.
It's me.
A truck driver? "Karateman"?
Ryu gave him my number?
OK, Put him through.
Yeah.
That's right.
This is Ken masters.
So you're looking for your missing friend and Ryu told you that I might know something, right?
So where did you meet Ryu, anyway?
I've located Ryu.
Get everything ready.
Begin preparations for plan B, just in case.
Chun-Li?
Listen, we found out where Ryu is.
Turns out, he's a lot closer than you'd think.
What am I doing here?
I guess the nostalgia of hearing about a former opponent got the better of me.
And now here I am chasing ghosts...
He left his family behind when he disappeared.
I couldn't imagine him doing something like that.
- Who are you?
- So we finally meet face to face.
I'd like to test your abilities, if you don't mind.
I suppose you're feeling a little confused right now.
I would be.
But I've known about you for a long time.
I was really hoping to meet you under better circumstances.
Oh, well!
Such power...
You're no ordinary fighter!
Tatsumaki!
Well?
Having fun?
Ready to show me what you can really do?
Hold it right there!
Don't fight her.
She's testing you.
Trying to bring out your true power...
I don't know who you are, but I know what you want.
Cammy, stop!
She's too strong for you.
What!
?
Quite a fashion statement, no?
There's only one like it.
And it's mine.
There's a lot at stake here.
I'll do what I have to to win.
Cammy, wait!
What'll it be, Ryu?
This poor girl's about to die.
Aren't you going to save her?
Don't do it!
If you fight now... make your choice!
This is it.
It's happening!
my God, he's gonna kill me.
So this is the Satsui no Hado...
Beautiful...
His power's off the charts.
He can't be captured in this state.
At least I got some data for analysis...
Ryu!
I know you!
Oh, no...
Ryu!
Stop!
No!
No, Ryu-san!
Stop it!
Cammy!
Cammy, are you OK?
It's me.
Dispatch a helicopter immediately.
We have a man down.
She's in bad shape.
Hurry!
Cammy's condition has stabilized.
Luckily, none of her vital organs were injured.
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have let her go ahead of us by herself.
oK...
Tell me everything you guys have figured out so far.
We managed to get our hands on a research brief detailing a new weapon.
The report is addressed to an emerging arms manufacturing corporation
- called S.I.N.
- S.I.N.?
I've heard of them.
They've grown like a weed for the past few years, but there's all sorts of rumors linking them to crime syndicates.
I'm pretty sure their ceo is named Seth...
Seth... something.
This is S.I.N.'s latest weapon.
It's codenamed BLECE.
The weapon isn't chemical, biological or nuclear.
It's powered by energy found within the human body.
This spiritual energy is what you might call "Ki. "
The BLECE device provides a method of harnessing human energy to cause a cyclical chain reaction...
This energy is artificially extracted from the subject and amplified via the device.
The resultant pulse resonates within the victim, causing the mitochondria to overflow with excess kinetic energy.
The moisture within living tissue begins to boil, causing an expansion that detonates the cells from within.
What a fantastic invention it is.
It uses the energy inside living things against the very form of life from whence it came.
It's clean.
It's simple.
It's... elegant.
When this device is shrunken down for commercial manufacturing, it will only become a bigger threat.
once miniaturized, the device can actually be implanted inside subjects, allowing them to harness their ki to cause massive destructive effects.
The subject can easily plant themselves into any crowd and be undetected.
The implications this could have on terrorism are frightening.
It can be thought of as a way to augment the natural ki energy we all hold within.
Essentially, it could give anyone powers that resemble the Satsui no Hado.
A new breed of undetectable assassins will rain destruction down upon civilization.
The missing fighters were used as guinea pigs for their research.
Their mastery of ki made them the perfect fodder for their tests.
S.I.N.'s goal is to get their hands on Ryu, who they regard as the ultimate test subject.
I cannot overstate my supreme disappointment.
You had Ryu in your sights, yet you come back to me without even a single shred of data to further our research.
Betrayal saddens me.
How do you suppose I should deal with this sadness... maya, was it?
Plan B was devised precisely for situations such as this.
That said, the plan will require a few adjustments.
Ifwe cause the Satsui no Hado to manifest itself in Ryu again, we won't be able to touch him.
We know that now.
Therefore, I propose that the ceo himself grace us with his participation.
You strike me as a curious man.
I'm sure you'd like a chance to see what Ryu is capable of firsthand.
And how are you today, Ken masters?
That voice...
You're that maya woman.
You remembered!
I'm honored.
Listen, I'm planning a fabulous party aboard a boat.
You'll be there, won't you?
Cut the games.
Who are you?
Why did you fight Ryu?
Do you work for S.I.N.?
So, you'll come?
I mean, your wife's here already.
may as well join her, right?
Eliza!
?
No...
I didn't even notice she was gone.
Tell me what you want!
It's yours!
What I want?
Quit screwing around!
You kidnapped her!
I know it!
She wouldn't just leave without telling me!
You're just a little know-it-all, aren't you?
How well do you really know your wife?
How many hours did you spend talking with her this week?
Or would minutes be more appropriate?
Didn't you notice anything on your mantle that wasn't there before?
Cute doll, isn't it?
- What are you getting at?
- Your wife is my guest, Ken masters.
She came here of her own free will.
Fine.
So I just have to show up at your little shindig, right?
- That's all you want?
- Well, that's not all I want.
You're going to bring Ryu along for the festivities.
Do I make myself clear?
Dammit.
They want Ryu in exchange for Eliza.
No!
If I hadn't beaten up your security guards...
It's not your fault.
This one is all me.
So what's the plan?
I doubt the police would be any use to us.
And we can'tjust hand Ryu over to them.
You got that right!
Ryu isn't going anywhere!
I'll rescue Eliza myself!
No...
I'll go.
- Ryu...
- If they're after my power, then the only way to put a stop to their plan is to keep it under control.
Right in front of them, so they know I can do it.
- Can you pull that off?
- You just worry about Eliza.
Sounds good.
You can count on our help, too.
Have a seat.
You tricked me.
Hold it right there.
Who are you two?
The agency sent us to help with the party.
We're the entertainment.
Hey, wait a second.
Sure this ain't some mistake?
Didn't hear nothing about hiring girls.
- The only mistake...
- Is you two...
Not knowing when to shut up!
Well, then...
- Ready for a little extra credit?
- Yeah!
I called in a favor to an old Coast Guard buddy.
Help is on the way.
In the meantime, teach those goons a lesson!
Let's split up.
I'll go after Eliza.
You take care of the bad guys.
I'll be fine here on my own.
You two go join the others.
Well, look what the cat dragged in...
I suppose whoever's fighting the guards right now are the same ones who stole the data from our facility?
Not that I care, mind you.
No matter who else you brought with you, my intuition tells me that Ryu's here.
That's all that matters.
- Where's Eliza?
- Take a hike, blondie.
I don't need you anymore.
- Where is Eliza!
?
- Out of my way!
C'mon!
I'll beat an answer out of you!
Your wife is right inside that room.
Ryu might possess an incredible power, but you're no slouch yourself.
Good luck, mr. masters.
Sorry to keep you waiting, babe.
Took a little while to get dressed.
Love the red.
That outfit always did look great on you.
Let's go.
This place gives me the creeps.
Is it ok for me to exert myself like that?
I mean, would running hurt the baby?
When did you find out?
Jeez, I didn't even know...
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to surprise you.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's my fault for not giving you a chance to bring it up.
Hell of a sense of timing you got there, though.
I love you so much, Eliza.
I just realized the strength that can come from wanting to protect someone you love.
I guess that's my special power.
I don't need Satsui no Hado or anything else.
Not when I have so much to look forward to.
You're gonna be a godfather, Ryu!
A good portion of life is spent wondering "why".
There are all manner of things that defy understanding.
Most of the time, it is difficult to determine where to begin looking for reason.
No matter the circumstances, your presence here was not inevitable.
on top of that, my presence here was far from a foregone conclusion.
Yet here we are.
Why do you suppose that is?
My apologies for the late introduction...
I... am Seth.
I understand, Ryu.
I know why we are here.
You see, I simply could not resist the chance to test out the legendary power you possess, myself.
You struggle against the temptation of that power.
Oh, it must be torture.
Ryu!
Ryu!
Ryu-san!
Sho...
Ryu...
Ken!
Still, some questions must be asked, some situations faced head on.
Surely you, who are most at home in the ring, find this power inside to be a great temptation...
And yet you struggle in vain against it even as it seeks to control you utterly.
Why do you fight it?
Why!
?
Keep it inside and you will die!
Your death'll garner nothing.
It'll be without meaning!
Stay back!
Power only has meaning if it is put into action.
It defines you.
Power like that is what rules the world!
Everyone seeks power, seeks to grow in strength.
But this goal is out of reach of ordinary men.
The poor seek riches, the ugly, beauty.
We compare ourselves to others and seek to cover our own inadequacies to find peace of mind.
The mere existence of those who are better than us becomes intolerable.
We fight in retaliation!
If beauty is not enough, we use money.
If money does not work, we resort to violence.
This energy is what powers our world!
It is essential.
All I seek is to help this natural process along!
This destructive force begotten from conflict, this power that everyone lusts for,
I will spread it over the world with but a touch.
It is like a well that can never run dry.
A precious mineral flowing from an inexhaustible mine!
This power will be mine.
Stubborn mule...
You avert your eyes from the power within and refuse to fight.
That may offer you a modicum of empty solace when faced with your pitiful frailty, but no more.
Pathetic.
Despite the power you possess, you will become a disposable test subject no different from the others.
I'm not through fighting.
And I do not run from the power I hold within.
I, too, seek strength.
That's what has driven me all this way.
And yet I never truly understood just what power is.
Or what it means to be strong.
Your words did help me to understand one thing.
The power I seek is nothing like what you describe.
The power humans possess, that is the source of and destination for all of life.
The power you're after is the opposite of this.
It can only destroy that which is good.
To seek it invites your own demise.
That is why I fight!
I fight to rid the world of such diabolical power.
I'll show you what true strength is!
It is the courage to stand up in the face of evil and emerge victorious.
What is this nonsense?
Power is power.
There is no difference!
Here's your answer.
Let go!
What have you done?
No...
What... is this... power?
!
How...
How could this happen?
You actually hurt me... my body!
They're getting away!
Hope your insurance is paid up!
Ryu!
This is the US Coast Guard.
Your are suspected of having entered this harbor without permission.
Prepare for a compulsory search of your vessel.
Passengers and crew should stand by for further instructions.
Oh, my God...
Shadaloo!
I bring you a message from Lord Bison.
You put on a fantastic show.
Y
He's been watching you all along.
He has another message for you, as well.
S.I.N.'s success has come only through the manipulation of Shadaloo working behind the scenes to ensure your good fortune.
He wanted you to know that.
Ken.
Did you see that?
I...
I saw it alright, bro!
That was amazing.
You really let your true power shine through.
I can feel it in you too, Ken.
This... power...
Thanks for coming to see me off, Ken-san.
I really wanted to stick around until Ryu-san gets better, but tickets are really cheap right now, so I had to jump at the chance.
I am a student, you know.
I'm not made of money.
Oh, that's right.
My friend gave me some chocolates she got on her trip to Hawaii.
Want some?
They're really good.
Even with all that evidence, we're right back where we started.
The cover-up is so vast, even the dispatch of the Coast Guard has been officially denied.
It feels like we're being treated as the enemy instead of the real threat.
The abduction and murder of the fighters, the connection to Shadaloo...
- It all goes unpunished...
- The evil is still out there.
Bison...
You may think you have the upper hand, but the truth is that S.I.N. has been manipulating Shadaloo.
Fool.
It's me.
About that new power Ryu displayed for us the other day...
Say no more.
I'll resume the search right away, sir.
Excellent job, Crimson Viper.
Your report was more than satisfactory.
Keep this up and we should know everything there is to know about S.I.N.'s activities.
Undercover work is no picnic, and we know you've been through hell already.
But there is simply no one else as suited to this job as you.
Please understand.
once the CIA has the information we need, we can bring S.I.N. to justice.
Don't worry about me, sir.
I understand my mission.
What's the matter, Ryu?
It's just that bird...
Looks like he got separated from the flock.
Yeah... maybe...
I guess this is goodbye.
Thanks.
But why are you headed out to train, anyway?
I mean, you've already proven you can keep the Satsui no Hado under control.
That may have been an exception.
I'm not sure I can do it every time.
It took an incredible amount of concentration.
I'm still nowhere near finished with my training.
I guess there's no arguing with you.
Go if you have to.
Go to places the rest of us can only dream of.
I wish you well.
Thanks.
And, don't worry, we'll meet again.
I'm looking forward to seeing how strong you've become by then.
You and I may travel down different roads, but our life-force is one and the same.
I'm sure our paths will lead to the same destination.
Oh, we will meet again i guarantee it.
Energy discharge confirmed
A sudden dispersion of charged particles followed by the requisite disturbance to the ionosphere.
origin has been narrowed to the Amazonian basin.
This is the third time and again from another new location.
No unusual solar flares spotted today.
The phenomenon is so localized It has to be artificial in origin.
maybe it's an experiment or something.
the magnitude of this discharge seems larger than the others.
it is.
Good news is we've managed to get a fix on the origin point.
Here's an image taken from a private satellite approximately five hours ago.
Take a look.
I don't see a thing.
we all know it doesn't take much
Cammy?
I'd have to agree there.
And it goes beyond this surveillance photo.
We can't say for certain that all of our data isn't being intercepted and altered as it comes in.
either.
Whoever's doing this has the wool pulled over the entire world's eyes.
Something is out there.
Something sinister operating from the shadows.
But who could have the connections and reach to pull that off?
perhaps?
But Shadaloo is history Or so they say.
then.
The paperwork will have to wait.
That's right.
The man you're looking for went missing three weeks ago.
but you know how these things go we simply don't have the manpower but investigations like that cost money and require personnel.
was he?
he used to come here to give martial arts lessons
Bottom line?
Word came down from the brass.
my hands are tied.
Is there something going on I should know about?
Interpol visiting this little burg?
What if I told you this was happening all over the world?
Would that satisfy you?
I'd say we hit another dead end.
Don't let it get to you.
We're bound to find something eventually.
you sound like a cop.
Ever consider spending your time offwith your wife? huh?
are you? but I couldn't get it out of my head once I did.
That's when I called you Figured you might know something.
Fighters from around the world disappearing seemed to be up your alley.
It all started last year.
Famous martial artists just started vanishing.
The only thing in common is that each is considered the top practitioner in his or her respective art.
and no evidence is left behind following any of the abductions. but there've been no ransom demands. and that's when I put the badge back on there are forces within Interpol that want this investigation stopped.
They say there's no evidence to link the disappearances.
They consider this a waste of resources.
right?
once you start talking about fighters from around the world that just brings a lot of stuff floating back up to the surface.
Like Shadaloo I won't believe it till I see it.
Not after what I've been through.
I know what they're capable of.
They're still alive I know it.
right?
sir.
I'm sorry.
No matter
This weapon's value won't become evident until we manage to shrink it down and make it commercially viable.
lets consider this but a preview to drum up interest.
Let it bring people to our little party.
Loosen their pocketbooks a bit.
Don't you agree?
we'll need him.
I know this one.
He practices an art that was initially developed for assassination.
But there should be another that is even more powerful than him.
We aren't after him for his fighting style eclipses even that of the other.
That power is called Satsui no Hado.
And this power would allow us to bring the BLECE project to fruition?
sir.
Satsui no Hado
The murderous intent Interesting
you have the usual management meeting.
VP of European operations has a teleconference scheduled for 11:30.
Representatives from the Pacific Rim exposition will be here
but allow me to introduce myself.
My name's Maya.
I'm a freelance journalist.
but all interviews must be scheduled in advance.
I'd like to get a comment regarding the rising price of crude oil.
What's the Masters Group doing to combat this?
no interview.
the greatest American fighter and top dog of the business world.
I had you pegged all wrong.
I wouldn't have expected you to get so worked up over a sudden visitor.
I thought fighters were supposed to be more laid-back.
are you?
I wonder if your friend Ryu is in the habit of turning people away if they don't have an appointment.
but I'd say you're worlds apart.
I'll be going now.
I'll be sure to make an appointment next time so your precious rules are protected.
Ryu friend?
Still lost in your own head?
We both knew that our last battle wouldn't be the one to settle the score.
That fight can only take place once we've both truly found ourselves. tempting you to throw away your humanity for unlimited power.
But you manage to make even that burden almost noble.
I have trouble even relating to you as a fighter these days.
I'm in a whole different world now.
Career Family it's not like they're a burden. the more I forget what it means to be a warrior.
Time just keeps passing and I feel like I'm running in place.
Listen to me go on about my stupid problems
Whatever What's the point?
Ryu.
I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
I didn't have to work for this.
It's me.
About today's schedule
Squeeze in as much as you can.
I'm ready to work.
I think we got it.
This is definitely where the energy discharge took place.
So they did alter the images that's for sure.
Looks like something heavy was sitting here.
eh?
Bag them up.
Let's take a few corpses for analysis.
Captain! so I thought I'd do some digging to see why
God!
Human bodies
boy?
Until my last breath!
Why do you resist the power within?
I don't desire power!
I have my sights set higher than that!
then?
but you have no answer.
Seeking anything but power is foolishness of the highest order!
The blood flowing through your veins calls out to you.
Answer it!
Answer it with your life!
No!
Then I shall murder you myself!
This mundane world is of no concern to us!
We grow stronger by consuming human life!
Enough!
I don't know anything about my birth.
My earliest memories are of master Goutetsu and master Gouken.
I remember Akuma training with them.
He was strong.
Stronger than the others.
All he cared about was power.
one day he murdered master Gouken.
I must defeat Akuma!
I can't allow myself to become like him in the process.
But what can I do!
?
All my blood and sweat and training brings me no closer to finding my true purpose!
Keeping my urges under control takes all the power I can muster!
I don't know how long I can resist!
Ken!
I'll just be a minute.
thanks.
You're Eliza masters
I interviewed your husband the other day.
He's a great man.
You saw Ken?
How was he?
Did he seem to be in good spirits?
he's just been so busy lately.
I don't really get to see him so much.
Yeah You feel like a cup of coffee or something?
Just us girls?
there's a series of large scale secret experiments occurring all over the world.
Cammy hasn't changed a bit
That's right.
We found ten so far.
And it gets worse.
The victims' identities came as quite a surprise.
And a surprise it was. but the fighters we're tracking down ended up dead.
They'd been abandoned in a shallow grave in the middle of a jungle.
But Cammy didn't just call to give us a shock. not even Delta Red intelligence can figure outjust how they got there.
The big picture is still a mystery.
Cammy About those animal corpses you collected
We've examined them thoroughly and this is just incredible.
Never seen anything li Get on with it.
Oh!
OK
Are you ready for this?
Some of the victims' cells seem to have actually exploded.
causing it to boil.
It's It's freaky stuff!
I just I haven't actually reported this up the chain of command just yet.
For some reason I get the feeling it'd be swept under the rug if I did.
The Army and the fbi are suspiciously reluctant to help.
but I imagine they're in the same boat.
If even Interpol and Delta Red's intelligence is being manipulated there must be a huge organization responsible for all this.
To tell the truth
We did have an investigation going at one point.
I even had some leads But
We'll get to the bottom of this!
Too many people have been hurt already!
madam.
Thank you.
Isn't it just adorable?
A friend gave it to me.
She's a journalist.
I bet your husband will think it's cute as a button.
I hardly ever see him.
Still
We should talk soon.
Contact your boss.
Right now!
I've got a message for him.
I don't appreciate being toyed with.
You're gonna have to show a little more faith.
You are regarded as a capable soldier.
Is my speaking directly to you not sufficient to show my trust in you?
you'll call off your lapdogs and let me operate in peace so I can concentrate.
I can do that.
But are you sure you're barking up the right tree?
not Ken masters.
The time it would take to blindly search for a wandering vagabond like Ryu is a luxury I can't afford.
The fact that you have so many others on the case tells me you're aware of that much.
What we have to do is wait for him to show up.
it's masters.
Their friendship and rivalry run deep.
friend. perhaps my body could have sustained you a bit longer.
All of mankind holds a power within.
but eternal
Life begets more life and the cycle continues.
this power is what drives it all.
But what is power? but security's too tight for that to be the case.
Only one way to find out for sure
Look!
That's the missing American karate champ!
That's enough!
Sonic Boom!
Hey!
anyway?
but what are they researching?
They're onto us.
We'd better move.
Alright.
Let's go
Chun-Li!
Gimme a sec.
So we lost another one
anyway?
And who's responsible?
these fighters are being used in some kind of strange experiments.
Boiling Liquid Expanding Cell Explosion
BLECE.
Exploding cells?
Scads of dead animals in the Amazon exhibiting that sort of damage.
I'm no scientist.
This stuff's way over my head.
Do you suppose there's a connection to the missing fighters?
my God
Ryu!
?
What!
?
It can be postulated that the completion of the BLECE project hinges a power that lies dormant in this particular subject.
BLECE can never achieve its full potential
Harnessing the Satsui no Hado?
madness at least we know now that Ryu is going to be their next target.
Let's get moving.
We have find him before they do.
But how do are we supposed to find him?
He never stays in one place for long.
if anyone knows where Ryu is
It's Ken!
That's right!
I bet he can find him!
Wait What if we're not the only ones to come to that conclusion?
baby.
I thought my secretary followed me home.
What's up?
You OK?
Never mind.
You look so tired
have we?
baby.
I haven't forgotten about you.
Well Who are you trying to forget then?
You The you standing in front of me right now
You're not the Ken Masters I fell in love with.
you used to be so laid back and carefree.
but you've changed.
so serious.
It's almost like you're trying to chase someone out of your heart.
Tell me what's going on.
I think you give me way too much credit.
I was never carefree.
I was always serious.
Is that what you really want to say?
No I just
Stay here.
Who's there?
What is wrong with you people?
What the Sakura!
?
That was a pretty rude welcome you know.
I got treated like a common burglar or something.
they so started it!
I should hope so!
That's what I pay them for!
you know.
I am uptight.
so I'm later than I'd expected.
dontcha think?
Ken-san.
Sakura?
Well I'm trying to track Ryu-san down.
Ryu?
Please tell me where he is!
I don't know where he is.
I figure his stalker oughtta know better than anyone.
I don't.
That's why I came here.
So deal.
So Why do you need to see him all of a sudden?
Hello?
From Chun-Li?
Put her through.
Hey!
Long time no see.
What's up?
You're calling pretty late.
you did?
Sorry.
I've been really busy lately.
I told my secretary to only let business calls through.
I'm at home.
Yeah?
You're looking for Ryu?
I've got no idea.
Here?
Now?
but
I'm a little busy right now.
We'll talk when you arrive.
I'm Ryu's personal assistant now.
Ken-san?
Yeah?
Have you heard about the disappearances?
The fighters being kidnapped?
What?
So you haven't heard.
Famous martial artists from all over the world are vanishing.
You really didn't know about it?
I figured all fighters would have heard about it by now.
I've just been so busy lately
Tell me all about it!
What's going on!
?
What have we got here?
You some kinda karateman or somethin'?
Yeah Something like that.
I thought so.
I've got a friend who's into that.
He lives around here.
You know him?
I do know him.
We've sparred before.
Your friend is quite a fighter.
Sure is.
It wasn't enough to help him
last year.
Haven't heard from him since.
Left behind a young wife.
She moved on.
Found a new man and got the heck outta Dodge.
though.
I really don't know all the details.
No one knows what happened to the victims or where they are.
The rumor just started circulating pretty recently.
the disappearances started last year.
All the victims are really famous.
No amateurs.
Everybody's talking about it lately.
It's big news.
I hadn't heard That's not true
I just wasn't listening.
Dammit!
That must be what Chun-Li was getting at on the phone.
this is no ordinary kidnapping case.
Something's up.
That's why I'm so worried about Ryu-san.
I don't know where he is or what he's up to or anything.
too.
Chun-Li and the others should be here soon enough.
We can figure out what to do when they arrive.
Looks like I won't be in the office for a while.
It's me.
A truck driver? "Karateman"?
Put him through.
Yeah.
That's right.
This is Ken masters.
So you're looking for your missing friend right?
anyway?
I've located Ryu.
Get everything ready.
just in case.
we found out where Ryu is.
he's a lot closer than you'd think.
What am I doing here?
I guess the nostalgia of hearing about a former opponent got the better of me.
And now here I am chasing ghosts
He left his family behind when he disappeared.
I couldn't imagine him doing something like that.
Who are you?
So we finally meet face to face.
if you don't mind.
I suppose you're feeling a little confused right now.
I would be.
But I've known about you for a long time.
I was really hoping to meet you under better circumstances.
well!
Such power You're no ordinary fighter!
Tatsumaki!
Well?
Having fun?
Ready to show me what you can really do?
Hold it right there!
Don't fight her.
She's testing you.
Trying to bring out your true power but I know what you want.
stop!
She's too strong for you.
What!
?
no?
There's only one like it.
And it's mine.
There's a lot at stake here.
I'll do what I have to to win.
wait!
Ryu?
This poor girl's about to die.
Aren't you going to save her?
Don't do it!
If you fight now make your choice!
This is it.
It's happening!
he's gonna kill me.
So this is the Satsui no Hado Beautiful
His power's off the charts.
He can't be captured in this state.
At least I got some data for analysis
Ryu!
I know you!
no Ryu!
Stop!
No!
Ryu-san!
Stop it!
Cammy!
are you OK?
It's me.
Dispatch a helicopter immediately.
We have a man down.
She's in bad shape.
Hurry!
Cammy's condition has stabilized.
none of her vital organs were injured.
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have let her go ahead of us by herself.
OK!
Tell me everything you guys have figured out so far.
We managed to get our hands on a research brief detailing a new weapon.
The report is addressed to an emerging arms manufacturing corporation
Called S.I.N.
S.I.N.?
I've heard of them. but there's all sorts of rumors linking them to crime syndicates.
I'm pretty sure their ceo is named Seth Seth something.
This is S.I.N.'s latest weapon.
It's codenamed BLECE.
biological or nuclear.
It's powered by energy found within the human body.
This spiritual energy is what you might call "Ki.
The BLECE device provides a method of harnessing human energy to cause a cyclical chain reaction
This energy is artificially extracted from the subject and amplified via the device. causing the mitochondria to overflow with excess kinetic energy. causing an expansion that detonates the cells from within.
What a fantastic invention it is.
It uses the energy inside living things against the very form of life from whence it came.
It's clean.
It's simple.
It's elegant. it will only become a bigger threat. allowing them to harness their Ki to cause massive destructive effects.
The subject can easily plant themselves into any crowd and be undetected.
The implications this could have on terrorism are frightening.
It can be thought of as a way to augment the natural ki energy we all hold within.
it could give anyone powers that resemble the Satsui no Hado.
A new breed of undetectable assassins will rain destruction down upon civilization.
The missing fighters were used as guinea pigs for their research.
Their mastery of Ki made them the perfect fodder for their tests. who they regard as the ultimate test subject.
I cannot overstate my supreme disappointment.
yet you come back to me without even a single shred of data to further our research.
Betrayal saddens me.
How do you suppose I should deal with this sadness was it?
Plan B was devised precisely for situations such as this.
the plan will require a few adjustments.
We won't be able to touch him.
We know that now.
I propose that the CEO himself grace us with his participation.
You strike me as a curious man.
I'm sure you'd like a chance to see what Ryu is capable of firsthand.
Ken masters?
That voice.
You're that maya woman.
You remembered!
I'm honored.
I'm planning a fabulous party aboard a boat.
won't you?
Cut the games.
Who are you?
Why did you fight Ryu?
Do you work for S.I.N.?
your wife's here already.
right?
Eliza!
?
No I didn't even notice she was gone.
Tell me what you want!
It's yours!
What I want?
Quit screwing around!
You kidnapped her!
I know it!
She wouldn't just leave without telling me!
aren't you?
How well do you really know your wife?
How many hours did you spend talking with her this week?
Or would minutes be more appropriate?
Didn't you notice anything on your mantle that wasn't there before?
isn't it?
Ken masters.
She came here of her own free will.
right?
that's not all I want.
You're going to bring Ryu along for the festivities.
Do I make myself clear?
Dammit.
They want Ryu in exchange for Eliza.
No!
If I hadn't beaten up your security guards
It's not your fault.
This one is all me.
So what's the plan?
I doubt the police would be any use to us.
And we can't just hand Ryu over to them.
You got that right!
Ryu isn't going anywhere!
I'll rescue Eliza myself!
No I'll go. then the only way to put a stop to their plan is to keep it under control.
so they know I can do it.
Can you pull that off?
You just worry about Eliza.
too.
Have a seat.
You tricked me.
Hold it right there.
Who are you two?
The agency sent us to help with the party.
We're the entertainment.
wait a second.
Sure this ain't some mistake?
Didn't hear nothing about hiring girls.
The only mistake Is you two
Not knowing when to shut up!
then
Ready for a little extra credit?
Yeah!
I called in a favor to an old Coast Guard buddy.
teach those goons a lesson!
Let's split up.
I'll go after Eliza.
You take care of the bad guys.
I'll be fine here on my own.
You two go join the others.
look what the cat dragged in
I suppose whoever's fighting the guards right now are the same ones who stole the data from our facility?
mind you.
my intuition tells me that Ryu's here.
That's all that matters.
blondie.
I don't need you anymore.
Where is Eliza!
?
Out of my way!
C'mon!
I'll beat an answer out of you!
Your wife is right inside that room.
but you're no slouch yourself.
mr. masters.
babe.
Took a little while to get dressed.
Love the red.
That outfit always did look great on you.
Let's go.
This place gives me the creeps.
Is it ok for me to exert myself like that?
would running hurt the baby?
I didn't even know
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to surprise you.
I'm so sorry.
it's my fault for not giving you a chance to bring it up.
though.
Eliza.
I just realized the strength that can come from wanting to protect someone you love.
I guess that's my special power.
I don't need Satsui no Hado or anything else.
Not when I have so much to look forward to.
Ryu!
A good portion of life is spent wondering "why".
There are all manner of things that defy understanding.
it is difficult to determine where to begin looking for reason.
your presence here was not inevitable.
my presence here was far from a foregone conclusion.
Yet here we are.
Why do you suppose that is?
My apologies for the late introduction
I am Seth.
Ryu.
I know why we are here.
I simply could not resist the chance to test out myself.
You struggle against the temptation of that power.
it must be torture.
Ryu!
Ryu!
Ryu-san!
Sho Ryu Ken! some situations faced head on. find this power inside to be a great temptation
And yet you struggle in vain against it even as it seeks to control you utterly.
Why do you fight it?
Why!
?
Keep it inside and you will die!
Your death'll garner nothing.
It'll be without meaning!
Stay back!
Power only has meaning if it is put into action.
It defines you.
Power like that is what rules the world!
seeks to grow in strength.
But this goal is out of reach of ordinary men.
beauty.
We compare ourselves to others and seek to cover our own inadequacies to find peace of mind.
The mere existence of those who are better than us becomes intolerable.
We fight in retaliation!
we use money.
we resort to violence.
This energy is what powers our world!
It is essential.
All I seek is to help this natural process along! I will spread it over the world with but a touch.
It is like a well that can never run dry.
A precious mineral flowing from an inexhaustible mine!
This power will be mine.
Stubborn mule
You avert your eyes from the power within and refuse to fight.
That may offer you a modicum of empty solace when faced but no more. you will become a disposable test subject no different from the others.
I'm not through fighting.
And I do not run from the power I hold within.
seek strength.
That's what has driven me all this way.
And yet I never truly understood just what power is.
Or what it means to be strong.
Your words did help me to understand one thing.
The power I seek is nothing like what you describe. that is the source of and destination for all of life.
The power you're after is the opposite of this.
It can only destroy that which is good.
To seek it invites your own demise.
That is why I fight!
I fight to rid the world of such diabolical power.
I'll show you what true strength is!
It is the courage to stand up in the face of evil and emerge victorious.
What is this nonsense?
Power is power.
There is no difference!
Here's your answer.
Let go!
What have you done?
No
What is this power?
!
How How could this happen?
You actually hurt me my body!
They're getting away!
Hope your insurance is paid up!
Ryu!
This is the US Coast Guard.
Your are suspected of having entered this harbor without permission.
Prepare for a compulsory search of your vessel.
Passengers and crew should stand by for further instructions.
my God Shadaloo!
I bring you a message from Lord Bison.
You put on a fantastic show.
Y
He's been watching you all along.
as well.
S.I.N.'s success has come only through the manipulation of Shadaloo working behind the scenes to ensure your good fortune.
He wanted you to know that.
Ken.
Did you see that?
I
bro!
That was amazing.
You really let your true power shine through.
Ken.
This power
Ken-san. so I had to jump at the chance.
you know.
I'm not made of money.
that's right.
My friend gave me some chocolates she got on her trip to Hawaii.
Want some?
They're really good.
we're right back where we started.
even the dispatch of the Coast Guard has been officially denied.
It feels like we're being treated as the enemy instead of the real threat. the connection to Shadaloo
It all goes unpunished The evil is still out there. but the truth is that S.I.N. has been manipulating Shadaloo.
Fool.
It's me.
About that new power Ryu displayed for us the other day
sir.
Crimson Viper.
Your report was more than satisfactory.
Keep this up and we should know everything there is to know about S.I.N.'s activities.
and we know you've been through hell already.
But there is simply no one else as suited to this job as you.
Please understand. we can bring S.I.N. to justice.
sir.
I understand my mission.
Ryu?
It's just that bird
Looks like he got separated from the flock.
Yeah maybe
I guess this is goodbye.
Thanks.
anyway?
you've already proven you can keep the Satsui no Hado under control.
That may have been an exception.
I'm not sure I can do it every time.
It took an incredible amount of concentration.
I'm still nowhere near finished with my training.
I guess there's no arguing with you.
Go if you have to.
Go to places the rest of us can only dream of.
I wish you well.
we'll meet again.
I'm looking forward to seeing how strong you've become by then. but our life-force is one and the same.
I'm sure our paths will lead to the same destination.
we will meet again i guarantee it

A sudden dispersion of charged particles followed by the requisite disturbance to the ionosphere.
origin has been narrowed to the Amazonian basin.
This is the third time and again from another new location.
No unusual solar flares spotted today.
- The phenomenon is so localized...
- It has to be artificial in origin.
maybe it's an experiment or something.
At any rate, the magnitude of this discharge seems larger than the others.
oh, it is.
Good news is we've managed to get a fix on the origin point.
Here's an image taken from a private satellite approximately five hours ago.
Take a look.
I don't see a thing.
of course, we all know it doesn't take much to alter photos these days.
Right, Cammy?
I'd have to agree there.
And it goes beyond this surveillance photo.
We can't say for certain that all of our data isn't being intercepted and altered as it comes in.
And it's notjust Delta Red that's affected, either.
Whoever's doing this has the wool pulled over the entire world's eyes.
Something is out there.
Something sinister operating from the shadows.
But who could have the connections and reach to pull that off?
Shadaloo, perhaps?
But Shadaloo is history...
Or so they say.
I'm off, then.
The paperwork will have to wait.
That's right.
The man you're looking for went missing three weeks ago.
The family has requested a full investigation, but...
In a small town like this, we simply don't have the manpower...
Of course, I feel sorry for the family, but investigations like that cost money and require personnel.
So, he was famous back home, was he?
You know, he used to come here to give martial arts lessons...
Bottom line?
Word came down from the brass.
my hands are tied.
Is there something going on I should know about?
I mean, Interpol visiting this little burg?
What if I told you this was happening all over the world?
Would that satisfy you?
Judging by the look on your face, I'd say we hit another dead end.
Don't let it get to you.
We're bound to find something eventually.
Boy, you sound like a cop.
Ever consider spending your time offwith your wife?
I thought you gave up police work yourself, and here you are doing this...
Birds of a feather, huh?
You're still not over Charlie, are you?
I only heard about the string of disappearances by coincidence, but I couldn't get it out of my head once I did.
That's when I called you...
Figured you might know something.
Fighters from around the world disappearing seemed to be up your alley.
It all started last year.
Famous martial artists just started vanishing.
The only thing in common is that each is considered the top practitioner in his or her respective art.
That, and no evidence is left behind following any of the abductions.
It'd be easy to assume an open and shut case of kidnapping, but there've been no ransom demands.
That was suspicious enough to get Interpol involved, and that's when I put the badge back on...
Actually, there are forces within Interpol that want this investigation stopped.
They say there's no evidence to link the disappearances.
They consider this a waste of resources.
Well, no naysayer is gonna stop us, right?
once you start talking about fighters from around the world...
Well, thatjust brings a lot of stuff floating back up to the surface.
Like Shadaloo...
There's no evidence that Bison and his men are really dead, though I hope to God they are.
Still, I won't believe it till I see it.
Not after what I've been through.
I know what they're capable of.
They're still alive...
I know it.
And, if they're still alive, they're probably behind this, right?
I understand your disappointment, sir.
I'm sorry.
No matter...
This weapon's value won't become evident until we manage to shrink it down and make it commercially viable.
For now, lets consider this but a preview to drum up interest.
Let it bring people to our little party.
Loosen their pocketbooks a bit.
Don't you agree?
Well, ifwe're to perfect the device, we'll need him.
I know this one.
He practices an art that was initially developed for assassination.
But there should be another that is even more powerful than him.
We aren't after him for his fighting style...
You see, if our theories are correct, he possesses a power within that, if awakened, eclipses even that ofthe other.
That power is called Satsui no Hado.
And this power would allow us to bring the BLECE project to fruition?
- Yes, sir.
- Satsui no Hado...
The murderous intent...
Interesting...
At ten, you have the usual management meeting.
VP of European operations has a teleconference scheduled for 11:30.
Representatives from the Pacific Rim exposition will be here...
I'm sure you're busy Mr. Masters, but allow me to introduce myself.
My name's Maya.
I'm a freelance journalist.
I'm sorry, but all interviews must be scheduled in advance.
I'd like to get a comment regarding the rising price of crude oil.
What's the Masters Group doing to combat this?
Didn't you hear the lady?
No appointment, no interview.
Ken Masters, the greatest American fighter and top dog of the business world.
I have to say, Mr. Masters, I had you pegged all wrong.
I wouldn't have expected you to get so worked up over a sudden visitor.
I thought fighters were supposed to be more laid-back.
That's cute...
You're not used to rejection, are you?
I wonder if your friend Ryu is in the habit of turning people away if they don't have an appointment.
You may have studied alongside him, but I'd say you're worlds apart.
I'll be going now.
I'll be sure to make an appointment next time so your precious rules are protected.
Ryu...
What are you up to these days, friend?
Still lost in your own head?
We both knew that our last battle wouldn't be the one to settle the score.
That fight can only take place once we've both truly found ourselves.
I know that the Satsui no Hado lurks within you like cancer, tempting you to throw away your humanity for unlimited power.
But you manage to make even that burden almost noble.
You know, Ryu, I have trouble even relating to you as a fighter these days.
I'm in a whole different world now.
Career...
Family...
Don't get me wrong, it's not like they're a burden.
Still, the more I live this life, the more I forget what it means to be a warrior.
Time just keeps passing and I feel like I'm running in place.
Listen to me go on about my stupid problems...
Whatever...
What's the point?
I suppose I've always seemed kinda trivial to a guy like you, Ryu.
After all, I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
I didn't have to work for this.
It's me.
About today's schedule...
Squeeze in as much as you can.
I'm ready to work.
I think we got it.
This is definitely where the energy discharge took place.
So they did alter the images...
This isn't a natural depression, that's for sure.
Looks like something heavy was sitting here.
And, jeez, look at all the dead animals, eh?
Bag them up.
Let's take a few corpses for analysis.
Captain!
What's the matter?
The ground here felt a bit soft, so I thought I'd do some digging to see why...
Oh, God!
Human bodies...
How long must you continue to resist, boy?
Until my last breath!
Why do you resist the power within?
I don't desire power!
I have my sights set higher than that!
What is it you seek, then?
Ah, but you have no answer.
Seeking anything but power is foolishness of the highest order!
The blood flowing through your veins calls out to you.
Answer it!
Answer it with your life!
No!
Then I shall murder you myself!
This mundane world is of no concern to us!
We grow stronger by consuming human life!
Enough!
I don't know anything about my birth.
My earliest memories are of master Goutetsu and master Gouken.
I remember Akuma training with them.
He was strong.
Stronger than the others.
All he cared about was power.
Then, one day...
he murdered master Gouken.
I must defeat Akuma!
However, I can't allow myself to become like him in the process.
But what can I do!
?
All my blood and sweat and training brings me no closer to finding my true purpose!
Keeping my urges under control takes all the power I can muster!
I don't know how long I can resist!
Ken!
I'll just be a minute.
Oh, thanks.
You're Eliza masters...
I interviewed your husband the other day.
He's a great man.
You saw Ken?
How was he?
Did he seem to be in good spirits?
I mean, he's just been so busy lately.
I don't really get to see him so much.
Yeah...
You feel like a cup of coffee or something?
Just us girls?
Delta Red is on the case.
There's a series of large scale secret experiments occurring all over the world.
Yeah, Cammy hasn't changed a bit...
That's right.
We found ten so far.
And it gets worse.
The victims' identities came as quite a surprise.
And a surprise it was.
I don't know how or why, but the fighters we're tracking down ended up dead.
They'd been abandoned in a shallow grave in the middle of a jungle.
But Cammy didn'tjust call to give us a shock.
Even if they determined the bodies to be those of the missing fighters, not even Delta Red intelligence can figure outjust how they got there.
The big picture is still a mystery.
Cammy...
About those animal corpses you collected...
We've examined them thoroughly and this is just incredible.
- Never seen anything li...
- Get on with it.
OK...
Are you ready for this?
Some of the victims' cells seem to have actually exploded.
It's as if the moisture inside of them was suddenly heated, causing it to boil.
It's...
It's freaky stuff!
I just...
I haven't actually reported this up the chain of command just yet.
For some reason...
I get the feeling it'd be swept under the rug if I did.
The Army and the fbi are suspiciously reluctant to help.
I don't have connections in the CIA, but I imagine they're in the same boat.
If even Interpol and Delta Red's intelligence is being manipulated and controlled behind the scenes, there must be a huge organization responsible for all this.
To tell the truth...
We did have an investigation going at one point.
I even had some leads...
But...
We'll get to the bottom of this!
Too many people have been hurt already!
Oh, what a beautiful doll, madam.
Thank you.
Isn't itjust adorable?
A friend gave it to me.
She's a journalist.
Well, I bet your husband will think it's cute as a button.
He's so busy these days, I hardly ever see him.
Still...
We should talk soon.
Contact your boss.
Right now!
I've got a message for him.
I don't appreciate being toyed with.
You're gonna have to show a little more faith.
You are regarded as a capable soldier.
Is my speaking directly to you not sufficient to show my trust in you?
If you do trust me, you'll call off your lapdogs and let me operate in peace so I can concentrate.
I can do that.
But are you sure you're barking up the right tree?
I distinctly recall ordering you to track down Ryu, not Ken masters.
The time it would take to blindly search for a wandering vagabond like Ryu is a luxury I can't afford.
The fact that you have so many others on the case tells me you're aware of that much.
What we have to do is wait for him to show up.
If he's going to stay in touch with anyone, it's masters.
Their friendship and rivalry run deep.
I'm sorry, friend.
If I'd have died before you, perhaps my body could have sustained you a bit longer.
All of mankind holds a power within.
The power of life.
This force is fragile, but eternal...
Life begets more life and the cycle continues.
This force, this power is what drives it all.
But what is power?
Looks like an ordinary ruined castle at first glance, but security's too tight for that to be the case.
Only one way to find out for sure...
Look!
That's the missing American karate champ!
That's enough!
Sonic...
Boom!
Hey!
What is this place, anyway?
Looks like a laboratory, but what are they researching?
They're onto us.
We'd better move.
Alright.
Let's go...
- Chun-Li!
- Gimme a sec.
So we lost another one...
Just what was going on there, anyway?
And who's responsible?
Clearly, these fighters are being used in some kind of strange experiments.
"Boiling Liquid Expanding Cell Explosion... "
"BLECE."
Exploding cells?
Scads of dead animals in the Amazon exhibiting that sort of damage.
I'm no scientist.
This stuff's way over my head.
Do you suppose there's a connection to the missing fighters?
Oh, my God...
- Ryu!
?
- What!
?
"It can be postulated that the completion of the BLECE project hinges on the system harnessing the Satsui no Hado, a power that lies dormant in this particular subject.
Without him and his power, BLECE can never achieve its full potential... "
Harnessing the Satsui no Hado?
madness...
Well, at least we know now that Ryu is going to be their next target.
Let's get moving.
We have find him before they do.
But how do are we supposed to find him?
He never stays in one place for long.
Well, if anyone knows where Ryu is...
- It's Ken!
- That's right!
I bet he can find him!
Wait...
What ifwe're not the only ones to come to that conclusion?
Hey, baby.
For a second there, I thought my secretary followed me home.
What's up?
You OK?
Never mind.
You look so tired...
You know, we really haven't talked lately, have we?
I'm sorry, baby.
I haven't forgotten about you.
Well...
Who are you trying to forget then?
You...
The you standing in front of me right now...
You're not the Ken Masters I fell in love with.
When I first met you, you used to be so laid back and carefree.
You were always smiling, but you've changed.
You've gotten so melancholy, so serious.
It's almost like you're trying to chase someone out of your heart.
Tell me what's going on.
I think you give me way too much credit.
I was never carefree.
I was always serious.
Is that what you really want to say?
No...
I just...
Stay here.
Who's there?
- What is wrong with you people?
- What the...
Sakura!
?
That was a pretty rude welcome.
I came all this way to see you, but, seriously,
I got treated like a common burglar or something.
And, by the way, they so started it!
Well, I should hope so!
That's what I pay them for!
You did sneak in, you know.
Oh, God, I am uptight.
I ran straight here from the airport, so I'm later than I'd expected.
I think you should hire some stronger security guards, dontcha think?
But I guess this place is pretty safe since you're here, Ken-san.
Anyway, to what do I owe the pleasure of your unannounced visit, Sakura?
Well...
I'm trying to track Ryu-san down.
- Ryu?
- Please tell me where he is!
Look, I don't know where he is.
I figure his stalker oughtta know better than anyone.
Well, I don't.
That's why I came here.
So deal.
So...
Why do you need to see him all of a sudden?
Hello?
From Chun-Li?
Put her through.
Hey!
Long time no see.
What's up?
You're calling pretty late.
Oh, you did?
Sorry.
I've been really busy lately.
I told my secretary to only let business calls through.
I'm at home.
Yeah?
You're looking for Ryu?
I've got no idea.
Here?
Now?
No, it's cool.
You can come by, but...
I'm a little busy right now.
We'll talk when you arrive.
Apparently, I'm Ryu's personal assistant now.
- Ken-san?
- Yeah?
Have you heard about the disappearances?
- The fighters being kidnapped?
- What?
So you haven't heard.
Famous martial artists from all over the world are vanishing.
You really didn't know about it?
I figured all fighters would have heard about it by now.
I've just been so busy lately...
Tell me all about it!
What's going on!
?
What have we got here?
You some kinda karateman or somethin'?
Yeah...
Something like that.
I thought so.
You know, I've got a friend who's into that.
He lives around here.
You know him?
- He's the US karate champ.
- Actually, I do know him.
We've sparred before.
Your friend is quite a fighter.
Sure is.
It wasn't enough to help him...
He went missing, all of a sudden, last year.
Haven't heard from him since.
Left behind a young wife.
She moved on.
Found a new man and got the heck outta Dodge.
I haven't given up lookin' for him, though.
I really don't know all the details.
No one knows what happened to the victims or where they are.
The rumorjust started circulating pretty recently.
From what I hear, the disappearances started last year.
All the victims are really famous.
No amateurs.
Everybody's talking about it lately.
It's big news.
I hadn't heard...
That's not true I just wasn't listening.
Dammit!
That must be what Chun-Li was getting at on the phone.
If she's involved, this is no ordinary kidnapping case.
Something's up.
That's why I'm so worried about Ryu-san.
I don't know where he is or what he's up to or anything.
He's my friend, too.
Chun-Li and the others should be here soon.
We can figure out what to do when they arrive.
Looks like I won't be in the office for a while.
It's me.
A truck driver? "Karateman"?
Ryu gave him my number?
OK, Put him through.
Yeah.
That's right.
This is Ken masters.
So you're looking for your missing friend and Ryu told you that I might know something, right?
So where did you meet Ryu, anyway?
I've located Ryu.
Get everything ready.
Begin preparations for plan B, just in case.
Chun-Li?
Listen, we found out where Ryu is.
Turns out, he's a lot closer than you'd think.
What am I doing here?
I guess the nostalgia of hearing about a former opponent got the better of me.
And now here I am chasing ghosts...
He left his family behind when he disappeared.
I couldn't imagine him doing something like that.
- Who are you?
- So we finally meet face to face.
I'd like to test your abilities, if you don't mind.
I suppose you're feeling a little confused right now.
I would be.
But I've known about you for a long time.
I was really hoping to meet you under better circumstances.
Oh, well!
Such power...
You're no ordinary fighter!
Tatsumaki!
Well?
Having fun?
Ready to show me what you can really do?
Hold it right there!
Don't fight her.
She's testing you.
Trying to bring out your true power...
I don't know who you are, but I know what you want.
Cammy, stop!
She's too strong for you.
What!
?
Quite a fashion statement, no?
There's only one like it.
And it's mine.
There's a lot at stake here.
I'll do what I have to to win.
Cammy, wait!
What'll it be, Ryu?
This poor girl's about to die.
Aren't you going to save her?
Don't do it!
If you fight now... make your choice!
This is it.
It's happening!
my God, he's gonna kill me.
So this is the Satsui no Hado...
Beautiful...
His power's off the charts.
He can't be captured in this state.
At least I got some data for analysis...
Ryu!
I know you!
Oh, no...
Ryu!
Stop!
No!
No, Ryu-san!
Stop it!
Cammy!
Cammy, are you OK?
It's me.
Dispatch a helicopter immediately.
We have a man down.
She's in bad shape.
Hurry!
Cammy's condition has stabilized.
Luckily, none of her vital organs were injured.
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have let her go ahead of us by herself.
oK...
Tell me everything you guys have figured out so far.
We managed to get our hands on a research brief detailing a new weapon.
The report is addressed to an emerging arms manufacturing corporation
- called S.I.N.
- S.I.N.?
I've heard of them.
They've grown like a weed for the past few years, but there's all sorts of rumors linking them to crime syndicates.
I'm pretty sure their ceo is named Seth...
Seth... something.
This is S.I.N.'s latest weapon.
It's codenamed BLECE.
The weapon isn't chemical, biological or nuclear.
It's powered by energy found within the human body.
This spiritual energy is what you might call "Ki. "
The BLECE device provides a method of harnessing human energy to cause a cyclical chain reaction...
This energy is artificially extracted from the subject and amplified via the device.
The resultant pulse resonates within the victim, causing the mitochondria to overflow with excess kinetic energy.
The moisture within living tissue begins to boil, causing an expansion that detonates the cells from within.
What a fantastic invention it is.
It uses the energy inside living things against the very form of life from whence it came.
It's clean.
It's simple.
It's... elegant.
When this device is shrunken down for commercial manufacturing, it will only become a bigger threat.
once miniaturized, the device can actually be implanted inside subjects, allowing them to harness their ki to cause massive destructive effects.
The subject can easily plant themselves into any crowd and be undetected.
The implications this could have on terrorism are frightening.
It can be thought of as a way to augment the natural ki energy we all hold within.
Essentially, it could give anyone powers that resemble the Satsui no Hado.
A new breed of undetectable assassins will rain destruction down upon civilization.
The missing fighters were used as guinea pigs for their research.
Their mastery of ki made them the perfect fodder for their tests.
S.I.N.'s goal is to get their hands on Ryu, who they regard as the ultimate test subject.
I cannot overstate my supreme disappointment.
You had Ryu in your sights, yet you come back to me without even a single shred of data to further our research.
Betrayal saddens me.
How do you suppose I should deal with this sadness... maya, was it?
Plan B was devised precisely for situations such as this.
That said, the plan will require a few adjustments.
Ifwe cause the Satsui no Hado to manifest itself in Ryu again, we won't be able to touch him.
We know that now.
Therefore, I propose that the ceo himself grace us with his participation.
You strike me as a curious man.
I'm sure you'd like a chance to see what Ryu is capable of firsthand.
And how are you today, Ken masters?
That voice...
You're that maya woman.
You remembered!
I'm honored.
Listen, I'm planning a fabulous party aboard a boat.
You'll be there, won't you?
Cut the games.
Who are you?
Why did you fight Ryu?
Do you work for S.I.N.?
So, you'll come?
I mean, your wife's here already.
may as well join her, right?
Eliza!
?
No...
I didn't even notice she was gone.
Tell me what you want!
It's yours!
What I want?
Quit screwing around!
You kidnapped her!
I know it!
She wouldn't just leave without telling me!
You're just a little know-it-all, aren't you?
How well do you really know your wife?
How many hours did you spend talking with her this week?
Or would minutes be more appropriate?
Didn't you notice anything on your mantle that wasn't there before?
Cute doll, isn't it?
- What are you getting at?
- Your wife is my guest, Ken masters.
She came here of her own free will.
Fine.
So I just have to show up at your little shindig, right?
- That's all you want?
- Well, that's not all I want.
You're going to bring Ryu along for the festivities.
Do I make myself clear?
Dammit.
They want Ryu in exchange for Eliza.
No!
If I hadn't beaten up your security guards...
It's not your fault.
This one is all me.
So what's the plan?
I doubt the police would be any use to us.
And we can'tjust hand Ryu over to them.
You got that right!
Ryu isn't going anywhere!
I'll rescue Eliza myself!
No...
I'll go.
- Ryu...
- If they're after my power, then the only way to put a stop to their plan is to keep it under control.
Right in front of them, so they know I can do it.
- Can you pull that off?
- You just worry about Eliza.
Sounds good.
You can count on our help, too.
Have a seat.
You tricked me.
Hold it right there.
Who are you two?
The agency sent us to help with the party.
We're the entertainment.
Hey, wait a second.
Sure this ain't some mistake?
Didn't hear nothing about hiring girls.
- The only mistake...
- Is you two...
Not knowing when to shut up!
Well, then...
- Ready for a little extra credit?
- Yeah!
I called in a favor to an old Coast Guard buddy.
Help is on the way.
In the meantime, teach those goons a lesson!
Let's split up.
I'll go after Eliza.
You take care of the bad guys.
I'll be fine here on my own.
You two go join the others.
Well, look what the cat dragged in...
I suppose whoever's fighting the guards right now are the same ones who stole the data from our facility?
Not that I care, mind you.
No matter who else you brought with you, my intuition tells me that Ryu's here.
That's all that matters.
- Where's Eliza?
- Take a hike, blondie.
I don't need you anymore.
- Where is Eliza!
?
- Out of my way!
C'mon!
I'll beat an answer out of you!
Your wife is right inside that room.
Ryu might possess an incredible power, but you're no slouch yourself.
Good luck, mr. masters.
Sorry to keep you waiting, babe.
Took a little while to get dressed.
Love the red.
That outfit always did look great on you.
Let's go.
This place gives me the creeps.
Is it ok for me to exert myself like that?
I mean, would running hurt the baby?
When did you find out?
Jeez, I didn't even know...
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to surprise you.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's my fault for not giving you a chance to bring it up.
Hell of a sense of timing you got there, though.
I love you so much, Eliza.
I just realized the strength that can come from wanting to protect someone you love.
I guess that's my special power.
I don't need Satsui no Hado or anything else.
Not when I have so much to look forward to.
You're gonna be a godfather, Ryu!
A good portion of life is spent wondering "why".
There are all manner of things that defy understanding.
Most of the time, it is difficult to determine where to begin looking for reason.
No matter the circumstances, your presence here was not inevitable.
on top of that, my presence here was far from a foregone conclusion.
Yet here we are.
Why do you suppose that is?
My apologies for the late introduction...
I... am Seth.
I understand, Ryu.
I know why we are here.
You see, I simply could not resist the chance to test out the legendary power you possess, myself.
You struggle against the temptation of that power.
Oh, it must be torture.
Ryu!
Ryu!
Ryu-san!
Sho...
Ryu...
Ken!
Still, some questions must be asked, some situations faced head on.
Surely you, who are most at home in the ring, find this power inside to be a great temptation...
And yet you struggle in vain against it even as it seeks to control you utterly.
Why do you fight it?
Why!
?
Keep it inside and you will die!
Your death'll garner nothing.
It'll be without meaning!
Stay back!
Power only has meaning if it is put into action.
It defines you.
Power like that is what rules the world!
Everyone seeks power, seeks to grow in strength.
But this goal is out of reach of ordinary men.
The poor seek riches, the ugly, beauty.
We compare ourselves to others and seek to cover our own inadequacies to find peace of mind.
The mere existence of those who are better than us becomes intolerable.
We fight in retaliation!
If beauty is not enough, we use money.
If money does not work, we resort to violence.
This energy is what powers our world!
It is essential.
All I seek is to help this natural process along!
This destructive force begotten from conflict, this power that everyone lusts for,
I will spread it over the world with but a touch.
It is like a well that can never run dry.
A precious mineral flowing from an inexhaustible mine!
This power will be mine.
Stubborn mule...
You avert your eyes from the power within and refuse to fight.
That may offer you a modicum of empty solace when faced with your pitiful frailty, but no more.
Pathetic.
Despite the power you possess, you will become a disposable test subject no different from the others.
I'm not through fighting.
And I do not run from the power I hold within.
I, too, seek strength.
That's what has driven me all this way.
And yet I never truly understood just what power is.
Or what it means to be strong.
Your words did help me to understand one thing.
The power I seek is nothing like what you describe.
The power humans possess, that is the source of and destination for all of life.
The power you're after is the opposite of this.
It can only destroy that which is good.
To seek it invites your own demise.
That is why I fight!
I fight to rid the world of such diabolical power.
I'll show you what true strength is!
It is the courage to stand up in the face of evil and emerge victorious.
What is this nonsense?
Power is power.
There is no difference!
Here's your answer.
Let go!
What have you done?
No...
What... is this... power?
!
How...
How could this happen?
You actually hurt me... my body!
They're getting away!
Hope your insurance is paid up!
Ryu!
This is the US Coast Guard.
Your are suspected of having entered this harbor without permission.
Prepare for a compulsory search of your vessel.
Passengers and crew should stand by for further instructions.
Oh, my God...
Shadaloo!
I bring you a message from Lord Bison.
You put on a fantastic show.
Y
He's been watching you all along.
He has another message for you, as well.
S.I.N.'s success has come only through the manipulation of Shadaloo working behind the scenes to ensure your good fortune.
He wanted you to know that.
Ken.
Did you see that?
I...
I saw it alright, bro!
That was amazing.
You really let your true power shine through.
I can feel it in you too, Ken.
This... power...
Thanks for coming to see me off, Ken-san.
I really wanted to stick around until Ryu-san gets better, but tickets are really cheap right now, so I had to jump at the chance.
I am a student, you know.
I'm not made of money.
Oh, that's right.
My friend gave me some chocolates she got on her trip to Hawaii.
Want some?
They're really good.
Even with all that evidence, we're right back where we started.
The cover-up is so vast, even the dispatch of the Coast Guard has been officially denied.
It feels like we're being treated as the enemy instead of the real threat.
The abduction and murder of the fighters, the connection to Shadaloo...
- It all goes unpunished...
- The evil is still out there.
Bison...
You may think you have the upper hand, but the truth is that S.I.N. has been manipulating Shadaloo.
Fool.
It's me.
About that new power Ryu displayed for us the other day...
Say no more.
I'll resume the search right away, sir.
Excellent job, Crimson Viper.
Your report was more than satisfactory.
Keep this up and we should know everything there is to know about S.I.N.'s activities.
Undercover work is no picnic, and we know you've been through hell already.
But there is simply no one else as suited to this job as you.
Please understand.
once the CIA has the information we need, we can bring S.I.N. to justice.
Don't worry about me, sir.
I understand my mission.
What's the matter, Ryu?
It's just that bird...
Looks like he got separated from the flock.
Yeah... maybe...
I guess this is goodbye.
Thanks.
But why are you headed out to train, anyway?
I mean, you've already proven you can keep the Satsui no Hado under control.
That may have been an exception.
I'm not sure I can do it every time.
It took an incredible amount of concentration.
I'm still nowhere near finished with my training.
I guess there's no arguing with you.
Go if you have to.
Go to places the rest of us can only dream of.
I wish you well.
Thanks.
And, don't worry, we'll meet again.
I'm looking forward to seeing how strong you've become by then.
You and I may travel down different roads, but our life-force is one and the same.
I'm sure our paths will lead to the same destination.
Oh, we will meet again i guarantee it.
Energy discharge confirmed
A sudden dispersion of charged particles followed by the requisite disturbance to the ionosphere.
origin has been narrowed to the Amazonian basin.
This is the third time and again from another new location.
No unusual solar flares spotted today.
- The phenomenon is so localized...
- It has to be artificial in origin.
maybe it's an experiment or something.
At any rate, the magnitude of this discharge seems larger than the others.
oh, it is.
Good news is we've managed to get a fix on the origin point.
Here's an image taken from a private satellite approximately five hours ago.
Take a look.
I don't see a thing.
of course, we all know it doesn't take much to alter photos these days.
Right, Cammy?
I'd have to agree there.
And it goes beyond this surveillance photo.
We can't say for certain that all of our data isn't being intercepted and altered as it comes in.
And it's notjust Delta Red that's affected, either.
Whoever's doing this has the wool pulled over the entire world's eyes.
Something is out there.
Something sinister operating from the shadows.
But who could have the connections and reach to pull that off?
Shadaloo, perhaps?
But Shadaloo is history...
Or so they say.
I'm off, then.
The paperwork will have to wait.
That's right.
The man you're looking for went missing three weeks ago.
The family has requested a full investigation, but...
In a small town like this, we simply don't have the manpower...
Of course, I feel sorry for the family, but investigations like that cost money and require personnel.
So, he was famous back home, was he?
You know, he used to come here to give martial arts lessons...
Bottom line?
Word came down from the brass.
my hands are tied.
Is there something going on I should know about?
I mean, Interpol visiting this little burg?
What if I told you this was happening all over the world?
Would that satisfy you?
Judging by the look on your face, I'd say we hit another dead end.
Don't let it get to you.
We're bound to find something eventually.
Boy, you sound like a cop.
Ever consider spending your time offwith your wife?
I thought you gave up police work yourself, and here you are doing this...
Birds of a feather, huh?
You're still not over Charlie, are you?
I only heard about the string of disappearances by coincidence, but I couldn't get it out of my head once I did.
That's when I called you...
Figured you might know something.
Fighters from around the world disappearing seemed to be up your alley.
It all started last year.
Famous martial artists just started vanishing.
The only thing in common is that each is considered the top practitioner in his or her respective art.
That, and no evidence is left behind following any of the abductions.
It'd be easy to assume an open and shut case of kidnapping, but there've been no ransom demands.
That was suspicious enough to get Interpol involved, and that's when I put the badge back on...
Actually, there are forces within Interpol that want this investigation stopped.
They say there's no evidence to link the disappearances.
They consider this a waste of resources.
Well, no naysayer is gonna stop us, right?
once you start talking about fighters from around the world...
Well, thatjust brings a lot of stuff floating back up to the surface.
Like Shadaloo...
There's no evidence that Bison and his men are really dead, though I hope to God they are.
Still, I won't believe it till I see it.
Not after what I've been through.
I know what they're capable of.
They're still alive...
I know it.
And, if they're still alive, they're probably behind this, right?
I understand your disappointment, sir.
I'm sorry.
No matter...
This weapon's value won't become evident until we manage to shrink it down and make it commercially viable.
For now, lets consider this but a preview to drum up interest.
Let it bring people to our little party.
Loosen their pocketbooks a bit.
Don't you agree?
Well, ifwe're to perfect the device, we'll need him.
I know this one.
He practices an art that was initially developed for assassination.
But there should be another that is even more powerful than him.
We aren't after him for his fighting style...
You see, if our theories are correct, he possesses a power within that, if awakened, eclipses even that ofthe other.
That power is called Satsui no Hado.
And this power would allow us to bring the BLECE project to fruition?
- Yes, sir.
- Satsui no Hado...
The murderous intent...
Interesting...
At ten, you have the usual management meeting.
VP of European operations has a teleconference scheduled for 11:30.
Representatives from the Pacific Rim exposition will be here...
I'm sure you're busy Mr. Masters, but allow me to introduce myself.
My name's Maya.
I'm a freelance journalist.
I'm sorry, but all interviews must be scheduled in advance.
I'd like to get a comment regarding the rising price of crude oil.
What's the Masters Group doing to combat this?
Didn't you hear the lady?
No appointment, no interview.
Ken Masters, the greatest American fighter and top dog of the business world.
I have to say, Mr. Masters, I had you pegged all wrong.
I wouldn't have expected you to get so worked up over a sudden visitor.
I thought fighters were supposed to be more laid-back.
That's cute...
You're not used to rejection, are you?
I wonder if your friend Ryu is in the habit of turning people away if they don't have an appointment.
You may have studied alongside him, but I'd say you're worlds apart.
I'll be going now.
I'll be sure to make an appointment next time so your precious rules are protected.
Ryu...
What are you up to these days, friend?
Still lost in your own head?
We both knew that our last battle wouldn't be the one to settle the score.
That fight can only take place once we've both truly found ourselves.
I know that the Satsui no Hado lurks within you like cancer, tempting you to throw away your humanity for unlimited power.
But you manage to make even that burden almost noble.
You know, Ryu, I have trouble even relating to you as a fighter these days.
I'm in a whole different world now.
Career...
Family...
Don't get me wrong, it's not like they're a burden.
Still, the more I live this life, the more I forget what it means to be a warrior.
Time just keeps passing and I feel like I'm running in place.
Listen to me go on about my stupid problems...
Whatever...
What's the point?
I suppose I've always seemed kinda trivial to a guy like you, Ryu.
After all, I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
I didn't have to work for this.
It's me.
About today's schedule...
Squeeze in as much as you can.
I'm ready to work.
I think we got it.
This is definitely where the energy discharge took place.
So they did alter the images...
This isn't a natural depression, that's for sure.
Looks like something heavy was sitting here.
And, jeez, look at all the dead animals, eh?
Bag them up.
Let's take a few corpses for analysis.
Captain!
What's the matter?
The ground here felt a bit soft, so I thought I'd do some digging to see why...
Oh, God!
Human bodies...
How long must you continue to resist, boy?
Until my last breath!
Why do you resist the power within?
I don't desire power!
I have my sights set higher than that!
What is it you seek, then?
Ah, but you have no answer.
Seeking anything but power is foolishness of the highest order!
The blood flowing through your veins calls out to you.
Answer it!
Answer it with your life!
No!
Then I shall murder you myself!
This mundane world is of no concern to us!
We grow stronger by consuming human life!
Enough!
I don't know anything about my birth.
My earliest memories are of master Goutetsu and master Gouken.
I remember Akuma training with them.
He was strong.
Stronger than the others.
All he cared about was power.
Then, one day...
he murdered master Gouken.
I must defeat Akuma!
However, I can't allow myself to become like him in the process.
But what can I do!
?
All my blood and sweat and training brings me no closer to finding my true purpose!
Keeping my urges under control takes all the power I can muster!
I don't know how long I can resist!
Ken!
I'll just be a minute.
Oh, thanks.
You're Eliza masters...
I interviewed your husband the other day.
He's a great man.
You saw Ken?
How was he?
Did he seem to be in good spirits?
I mean, he's just been so busy lately.
I don't really get to see him so much.
Yeah...
You feel like a cup of coffee or something?
Just us girls?
Delta Red is on the case.
There's a series of large scale secret experiments occurring all over the world.
Yeah, Cammy hasn't changed a bit...
That's right.
We found ten so far.
And it gets worse.
The victims' identities came as quite a surprise.
And a surprise it was.
I don't know how or why, but the fighters we're tracking down ended up dead.
They'd been abandoned in a shallow grave in the middle of a jungle.
But Cammy didn'tjust call to give us a shock.
Even if they determined the bodies to be those of the missing fighters, not even Delta Red intelligence can figure outjust how they got there.
The big picture is still a mystery.
Cammy...
About those animal corpses you collected...
We've examined them thoroughly and this is just incredible.
- Never seen anything li...
- Get on with it.
OK...
Are you ready for this?
Some of the victims' cells seem to have actually exploded.
It's as if the moisture inside of them was suddenly heated, causing it to boil.
It's...
It's freaky stuff!
I just...
I haven't actually reported this up the chain of command just yet.
For some reason...
I get the feeling it'd be swept under the rug if I did.
The Army and the fbi are suspiciously reluctant to help.
I don't have connections in the CIA, but I imagine they're in the same boat.
If even Interpol and Delta Red's intelligence is being manipulated and controlled behind the scenes, there must be a huge organization responsible for all this.
To tell the truth...
We did have an investigation going at one point.
I even had some leads...
But...
We'll get to the bottom of this!
Too many people have been hurt already!
Oh, what a beautiful doll, madam.
Thank you.
Isn't itjust adorable?
A friend gave it to me.
She's a journalist.
Well, I bet your husband will think it's cute as a button.
He's so busy these days, I hardly ever see him.
Still...
We should talk soon.
Contact your boss.
Right now!
I've got a message for him.
I don't appreciate being toyed with.
You're gonna have to show a little more faith.
You are regarded as a capable soldier.
Is my speaking directly to you not sufficient to show my trust in you?
If you do trust me, you'll call off your lapdogs and let me operate in peace so I can concentrate.
I can do that.
But are you sure you're barking up the right tree?
I distinctly recall ordering you to track down Ryu, not Ken masters.
The time it would take to blindly search for a wandering vagabond like Ryu is a luxury I can't afford.
The fact that you have so many others on the case tells me you're aware of that much.
What we have to do is wait for him to show up.
If he's going to stay in touch with anyone, it's masters.
Their friendship and rivalry run deep.
I'm sorry, friend.
If I'd have died before you, perhaps my body could have sustained you a bit longer.
All of mankind holds a power within.
The power of life.
This force is fragile, but eternal...
Life begets more life and the cycle continues.
This force, this power is what drives it all.
But what is power?
Looks like an ordinary ruined castle at first glance, but security's too tight for that to be the case.
Only one way to find out for sure...
Look!
That's the missing American karate champ!
That's enough!
Sonic...
Boom!
Hey!
What is this place, anyway?
Looks like a laboratory, but what are they researching?
They're onto us.
We'd better move.
Alright.
Let's go...
- Chun-Li!
- Gimme a sec.
So we lost another one...
Just what was going on there, anyway?
And who's responsible?
Clearly, these fighters are being used in some kind of strange experiments.
"Boiling Liquid Expanding Cell Explosion... "
"BLECE."
Exploding cells?
Scads of dead animals in the Amazon exhibiting that sort of damage.
I'm no scientist.
This stuff's way over my head.
Do you suppose there's a connection to the missing fighters?
Oh, my God...
- Ryu!
?
- What!
?
"It can be postulated that the completion of the BLECE project hinges on the system harnessing the Satsui no Hado, a power that lies dormant in this particular subject.
Without him and his power, BLECE can never achieve its full potential... "
Harnessing the Satsui no Hado?
madness...
Well, at least we know now that Ryu is going to be their next target.
Let's get moving.
We have find him before they do.
But how do are we supposed to find him?
He never stays in one place for long.
Well, if anyone knows where Ryu is...
- It's Ken!
- That's right!
I bet he can find him!
Wait...
What ifwe're not the only ones to come to that conclusion?
Hey, baby.
For a second there, I thought my secretary followed me home.
What's up?
You OK?
Never mind.
You look so tired...
You know, we really haven't talked lately, have we?
I'm sorry, baby.
I haven't forgotten about you.
Well...
Who are you trying to forget then?
You...
The you standing in front of me right now...
You're not the Ken Masters I fell in love with.
When I first met you, you used to be so laid back and carefree.
You were always smiling, but you've changed.
You've gotten so melancholy, so serious.
It's almost like you're trying to chase someone out of your heart.
Tell me what's going on.
I think you give me way too much credit.
I was never carefree.
I was always serious.
Is that what you really want to say?
No...
I just...
Stay here.
Who's there?
- What is wrong with you people?
- What the...
Sakura!
?
That was a pretty rude welcome.
I came all this way to see you, but, seriously,
I got treated like a common burglar or something.
And, by the way, they so started it!
Well, I should hope so!
That's what I pay them for!
You did sneak in, you know.
Oh, God, I am uptight.
I ran straight here from the airport, so I'm later than I'd expected.
I think you should hire some stronger security guards, dontcha think?
But I guess this place is pretty safe since you're here, Ken-san.
Anyway, to what do I owe the pleasure of your unannounced visit, Sakura?
Well...
I'm trying to track Ryu-san down.
- Ryu?
- Please tell me where he is!
Look, I don't know where he is.
I figure his stalker oughtta know better than anyone.
Well, I don't.
That's why I came here.
So deal.
So...
Why do you need to see him all of a sudden?
Hello?
From Chun-Li?
Put her through.
Hey!
Long time no see.
What's up?
You're calling pretty late.
Oh, you did?
Sorry.
I've been really busy lately.
I told my secretary to only let business calls through.
I'm at home.
Yeah?
You're looking for Ryu?
I've got no idea.
Here?
Now?
No, it's cool.
You can come by, but...
I'm a little busy right now.
We'll talk when you arrive.
Apparently, I'm Ryu's personal assistant now.
- Ken-san?
- Yeah?
Have you heard about the disappearances?
- The fighters being kidnapped?
- What?
So you haven't heard.
Famous martial artists from all over the world are vanishing.
You really didn't know about it?
I figured all fighters would have heard about it by now.
I've just been so busy lately...
Tell me all about it!
What's going on!
?
What have we got here?
You some kinda karateman or somethin'?
Yeah...
Something like that.
I thought so.
You know, I've got a friend who's into that.
He lives around here.
You know him?
- He's the US karate champ.
- Actually, I do know him.
We've sparred before.
Your friend is quite a fighter.
Sure is.
It wasn't enough to help him...
He went missing, all of a sudden, last year.
Haven't heard from him since.
Left behind a young wife.
She moved on.
Found a new man and got the heck outta Dodge.
I haven't given up lookin' for him, though.
I really don't know all the details.
No one knows what happened to the victims or where they are.
The rumorjust started circulating pretty recently.
From what I hear, the disappearances started last year.
All the victims are really famous.
No amateurs.
Everybody's talking about it lately.
It's big news.
I hadn't heard...
That's not true I just wasn't listening.
Dammit!
That must be what Chun-Li was getting at on the phone.
If she's involved, this is no ordinary kidnapping case.
Something's up.
That's why I'm so worried about Ryu-san.
I don't know where he is or what he's up to or anything.
He's my friend, too.
Chun-Li and the others should be here soon.
We can figure out what to do when they arrive.
Looks like I won't be in the office for a while.
It's me.
A truck driver? "Karateman"?
Ryu gave him my number?
OK, Put him through.
Yeah.
That's right.
This is Ken masters.
So you're looking for your missing friend and Ryu told you that I might know something, right?
So where did you meet Ryu, anyway?
I've located Ryu.
Get everything ready.
Begin preparations for plan B, just in case.
Chun-Li?
Listen, we found out where Ryu is.
Turns out, he's a lot closer than you'd think.
What am I doing here?
I guess the nostalgia of hearing about a former opponent got the better of me.
And now here I am chasing ghosts...
He left his family behind when he disappeared.
I couldn't imagine him doing something like that.
- Who are you?
- So we finally meet face to face.
I'd like to test your abilities, if you don't mind.
I suppose you're feeling a little confused right now.
I would be.
But I've known about you for a long time.
I was really hoping to meet you under better circumstances.
Oh, well!
Such power...
You're no ordinary fighter!
Tatsumaki!
Well?
Having fun?
Ready to show me what you can really do?
Hold it right there!
Don't fight her.
She's testing you.
Trying to bring out your true power...
I don't know who you are, but I know what you want.
Cammy, stop!
She's too strong for you.
What!
?
Quite a fashion statement, no?
There's only one like it.
And it's mine.
There's a lot at stake here.
I'll do what I have to to win.
Cammy, wait!
What'll it be, Ryu?
This poor girl's about to die.
Aren't you going to save her?
Don't do it!
If you fight now... make your choice!
This is it.
It's happening!
my God, he's gonna kill me.
So this is the Satsui no Hado...
Beautiful...
His power's off the charts.
He can't be captured in this state.
At least I got some data for analysis...
Ryu!
I know you!
Oh, no...
Ryu!
Stop!
No!
No, Ryu-san!
Stop it!
Cammy!
Cammy, are you OK?
It's me.
Dispatch a helicopter immediately.
We have a man down.
She's in bad shape.
Hurry!
Cammy's condition has stabilized.
Luckily, none of her vital organs were injured.
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have let her go ahead of us by herself.
oK...
Tell me everything you guys have figured out so far.
We managed to get our hands on a research brief detailing a new weapon.
The report is addressed to an emerging arms manufacturing corporation
- called S.I.N.
- S.I.N.?
I've heard of them.
They've grown like a weed for the past few years, but there's all sorts of rumors linking them to crime syndicates.
I'm pretty sure their ceo is named Seth...
Seth... something.
This is S.I.N.'s latest weapon.
It's codenamed BLECE.
The weapon isn't chemical, biological or nuclear.
It's powered by energy found within the human body.
This spiritual energy is what you might call "Ki. "
The BLECE device provides a method of harnessing human energy to cause a cyclical chain reaction...
This energy is artificially extracted from the subject and amplified via the device.
The resultant pulse resonates within the victim, causing the mitochondria to overflow with excess kinetic energy.
The moisture within living tissue begins to boil, causing an expansion that detonates the cells from within.
What a fantastic invention it is.
It uses the energy inside living things against the very form of life from whence it came.
It's clean.
It's simple.
It's... elegant.
When this device is shrunken down for commercial manufacturing, it will only become a bigger threat.
once miniaturized, the device can actually be implanted inside subjects, allowing them to harness their ki to cause massive destructive effects.
The subject can easily plant themselves into any crowd and be undetected.
The implications this could have on terrorism are frightening.
It can be thought of as a way to augment the natural ki energy we all hold within.
Essentially, it could give anyone powers that resemble the Satsui no Hado.
A new breed of undetectable assassins will rain destruction down upon civilization.
The missing fighters were used as guinea pigs for their research.
Their mastery of ki made them the perfect fodder for their tests.
S.I.N.'s goal is to get their hands on Ryu, who they regard as the ultimate test subject.
I cannot overstate my supreme disappointment.
You had Ryu in your sights, yet you come back to me without even a single shred of data to further our research.
Betrayal saddens me.
How do you suppose I should deal with this sadness... maya, was it?
Plan B was devised precisely for situations such as this.
That said, the plan will require a few adjustments.
Ifwe cause the Satsui no Hado to manifest itself in Ryu again, we won't be able to touch him.
We know that now.
Therefore, I propose that the ceo himself grace us with his participation.
You strike me as a curious man.
I'm sure you'd like a chance to see what Ryu is capable of firsthand.
And how are you today, Ken masters?
That voice...
You're that maya woman.
You remembered!
I'm honored.
Listen, I'm planning a fabulous party aboard a boat.
You'll be there, won't you?
Cut the games.
Who are you?
Why did you fight Ryu?
Do you work for S.I.N.?
So, you'll come?
I mean, your wife's here already.
may as well join her, right?
Eliza!
?
No...
I didn't even notice she was gone.
Tell me what you want!
It's yours!
What I want?
Quit screwing around!
You kidnapped her!
I know it!
She wouldn't just leave without telling me!
You're just a little know-it-all, aren't you?
How well do you really know your wife?
How many hours did you spend talking with her this week?
Or would minutes be more appropriate?
Didn't you notice anything on your mantle that wasn't there before?
Cute doll, isn't it?
- What are you getting at?
- Your wife is my guest, Ken masters.
She came here of her own free will.
Fine.
So I just have to show up at your little shindig, right?
- That's all you want?
- Well, that's not all I want.
You're going to bring Ryu along for the festivities.
Do I make myself clear?
Dammit.
They want Ryu in exchange for Eliza.
No!
If I hadn't beaten up your security guards...
It's not your fault.
This one is all me.
So what's the plan?
I doubt the police would be any use to us.
And we can'tjust hand Ryu over to them.
You got that right!
Ryu isn't going anywhere!
I'll rescue Eliza myself!
No...
I'll go.
- Ryu...
- If they're after my power, then the only way to put a stop to their plan is to keep it under control.
Right in front of them, so they know I can do it.
- Can you pull that off?
- You just worry about Eliza.
Sounds good.
You can count on our help, too.
Have a seat.
You tricked me.
Hold it right there.
Who are you two?
The agency sent us to help with the party.
We're the entertainment.
Hey, wait a second.
Sure this ain't some mistake?
Didn't hear nothing about hiring girls.
- The only mistake...
- Is you two...
Not knowing when to shut up!
Well, then...
- Ready for a little extra credit?
- Yeah!
I called in a favor to an old Coast Guard buddy.
Help is on the way.
In the meantime, teach those goons a lesson!
Let's split up.
I'll go after Eliza.
You take care of the bad guys.
I'll be fine here on my own.
You two go join the others.
Well, look what the cat dragged in...
I suppose whoever's fighting the guards right now are the same ones who stole the data from our facility?
Not that I care, mind you.
No matter who else you brought with you, my intuition tells me that Ryu's here.
That's all that matters.
- Where's Eliza?
- Take a hike, blondie.
I don't need you anymore.
- Where is Eliza!
?
- Out of my way!
C'mon!
I'll beat an answer out of you!
Your wife is right inside that room.
Ryu might possess an incredible power, but you're no slouch yourself.
Good luck, mr. masters.
Sorry to keep you waiting, babe.
Took a little while to get dressed.
Love the red.
That outfit always did look great on you.
Let's go.
This place gives me the creeps.
Is it ok for me to exert myself like that?
I mean, would running hurt the baby?
When did you find out?
Jeez, I didn't even know...
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to surprise you.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's my fault for not giving you a chance to bring it up.
Hell of a sense of timing you got there, though.
I love you so much, Eliza.
I just realized the strength that can come from wanting to protect someone you love.
I guess that's my special power.
I don't need Satsui no Hado or anything else.
Not when I have so much to look forward to.
You're gonna be a godfather, Ryu!
A good portion of life is spent wondering "why".
There are all manner of things that defy understanding.
Most of the time, it is difficult to determine where to begin looking for reason.
No matter the circumstances, your presence here was not inevitable.
on top of that, my presence here was far from a foregone conclusion.
Yet here we are.
Why do you suppose that is?
My apologies for the late introduction...
I... am Seth.
I understand, Ryu.
I know why we are here.
You see, I simply could not resist the chance to test out the legendary power you possess, myself.
You struggle against the temptation of that power.
Oh, it must be torture.
Ryu!
Ryu!
Ryu-san!
Sho...
Ryu...
Ken!
Still, some questions must be asked, some situations faced head on.
Surely you, who are most at home in the ring, find this power inside to be a great temptation...
And yet you struggle in vain against it even as it seeks to control you utterly.
Why do you fight it?
Why!
?
Keep it inside and you will die!
Your death'll garner nothing.
It'll be without meaning!
Stay back!
Power only has meaning if it is put into action.
It defines you.
Power like that is what rules the world!
Everyone seeks power, seeks to grow in strength.
But this goal is out of reach of ordinary men.
The poor seek riches, the ugly, beauty.
We compare ourselves to others and seek to cover our own inadequacies to find peace of mind.
The mere existence of those who are better than us becomes intolerable.
We fight in retaliation!
If beauty is not enough, we use money.
If money does not work, we resort to violence.
This energy is what powers our world!
It is essential.
All I seek is to help this natural process along!
This destructive force begotten from conflict, this power that everyone lusts for,
I will spread it over the world with but a touch.
It is like a well that can never run dry.
A precious mineral flowing from an inexhaustible mine!
This power will be mine.
Stubborn mule...
You avert your eyes from the power within and refuse to fight.
That may offer you a modicum of empty solace when faced with your pitiful frailty, but no more.
Pathetic.
Despite the power you possess, you will become a disposable test subject no different from the others.
I'm not through fighting.
And I do not run from the power I hold within.
I, too, seek strength.
That's what has driven me all this way.
And yet I never truly understood just what power is.
Or what it means to be strong.
Your words did help me to understand one thing.
The power I seek is nothing like what you describe.
The power humans possess, that is the source of and destination for all of life.
The power you're after is the opposite of this.
It can only destroy that which is good.
To seek it invites your own demise.
That is why I fight!
I fight to rid the world of such diabolical power.
I'll show you what true strength is!
It is the courage to stand up in the face of evil and emerge victorious.
What is this nonsense?
Power is power.
There is no difference!
Here's your answer.
Let go!
What have you done?
No...
What... is this... power?
!
How...
How could this happen?
You actually hurt me... my body!
They're getting away!
Hope your insurance is paid up!
Ryu!
This is the US Coast Guard.
Your are suspected of having entered this harbor without permission.
Prepare for a compulsory search of your vessel.
Passengers and crew should stand by for further instructions.
Oh, my God...
Shadaloo!
I bring you a message from Lord Bison.
You put on a fantastic show.
Y
He's been watching you all along.
He has another message for you, as well.
S.I.N.'s success has come only through the manipulation of Shadaloo working behind the scenes to ensure your good fortune.
He wanted you to know that.
Ken.
Did you see that?
I...
I saw it alright, bro!
That was amazing.
You really let your true power shine through.
I can feel it in you too, Ken.
This... power...
Thanks for coming to see me off, Ken-san.
I really wanted to stick around until Ryu-san gets better, but tickets are really cheap right now, so I had to jump at the chance.
I am a student, you know.
I'm not made of money.
Oh, that's right.
My friend gave me some chocolates she got on her trip to Hawaii.
Want some?
They're really good.
Even with all that evidence, we're right back where we started.
The cover-up is so vast, even the dispatch of the Coast Guard has been officially denied.
It feels like we're being treated as the enemy instead of the real threat.
The abduction and murder of the fighters, the connection to Shadaloo...
- It all goes unpunished...
- The evil is still out there.
Bison...
You may think you have the upper hand, but the truth is that S.I.N. has been manipulating Shadaloo.
Fool.
It's me.
About that new power Ryu displayed for us the other day...
Say no more.
I'll resume the search right away, sir.
Excellent job, Crimson Viper.
Your report was more than satisfactory.
Keep this up and we should know everything there is to know about S.I.N.'s activities.
Undercover work is no picnic, and we know you've been through hell already.
But there is simply no one else as suited to this job as you.
Please understand.
once the CIA has the information we need, we can bring S.I.N. to justice.
Don't worry about me, sir.
I understand my mission.
What's the matter, Ryu?
It's just that bird...
Looks like he got separated from the flock.
Yeah... maybe...
I guess this is goodbye.
Thanks.
But why are you headed out to train, anyway?
I mean, you've already proven you can keep the Satsui no Hado under control.
That may have been an exception.
I'm not sure I can do it every time.
It took an incredible amount of concentration.
I'm still nowhere near finished with my training.
I guess there's no arguing with you.
Go if you have to.
Go to places the rest of us can only dream of.
I wish you well.
Thanks.
And, don't worry, we'll meet again.
I'm looking forward to seeing how strong you've become by then.
You and I may travel down different roads, but our life-force is one and the same.
I'm sure our paths will lead to the same destination.
oh, we will meet again i guarantee it
By backfire
I'm going down to South Park Gonna have myself a time
Friendly faces everywhere Humble folks without temptation
Going down to South Park Gonna leave my woes behind
Ample parking day or night People spouting, "Howdy, neighbour"
Heading on up to South Park Gonna see if I can't unwind
Come on down to South Park And meet some friends of mine
I don't get it, Kenny.
Why did you buy razors and shaving cream?
Shave your balls?
Why would you shave your balls?
Girls like shaved balls?
What girl is going to see your balls?
Jesus!
There's another one.
Another pan flute band.
Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately?
Yeah, I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday.
All their crappy music sounds the same.
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go.
I think Kenny likes it.
- I got to get home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
- God!
- Shut up already!
I'm out of here.
See you, guys.
Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London.
London has something for everyone:
sights, theatre, and wonderful street performers.
- They're in London, too?
- Hey, time for dinner, guys.
- All right, kids, dig in.
- Where's Dad?
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
- Why?
- Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera, he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
All right, here we are.
Marsh family gathered for another dinner.
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
There's Shelly.
You excited about dinner, Shelly?
- Turn it off, Dad.
- Look.
Stan's eating a Tater Tot.
Wave to the camera, Stan.
Jesus Christ!
Neat-o!
It's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands.
Stan, go out and stand with them.
I can get a shot.
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces.
Screw you, Kyle.
- And, all right, your turn, Kenny.
- You guys, you guys, check this out.
I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
So?
So I just sat there and watched them for a while.
Guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
- How much?
- Over 200 bucks.
- $200%
- Really?
Are you sure?
Yeah, dude.
I'm starting to realise it's like the easiest job in the world,
- You know?
I mean, we could do that.
- Become a Peruvian flute band?
Yeah.
Why not?
We get some instruments and some costumes and then make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Oh, my God!
We're going to make so much fucking money, you guys.
Yeah.
But where are we going to get the money to buy costumes and instruments?
- Craig, dude, how you doing, bro?
- Fine.
Cool, awesome.
Craig, remember you were telling us how your grandma
- Gave you 100 bucks for your birthday?
- Yeah.
Craig, how would you like to turn that $100 into $1,000?
Come on in, Craig.
Have a seat.
Welcome.
What do you guys want?
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band.
All right, Craig.
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig.
Because they make bank.
We just need your money to buy some instruments and make some CDs.
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
You guys never hang out with me, you never invite me to do stuff, but now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me $100.
Craig, don't be an asshole.
I'll go get the money.
All right, guys.
Just like we rehearsed it.
You ready, Craig?
- All right, let's jam.
- And a one and a two and a...
- Wow, that's such cultural music.
- Very cultural, yes.
Por favor, buy our CDs de música.
How cultural.
This is awesome.
You see, Craig?
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, you guys can't play here.
We were here first.
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf.
You got that?
God damn it.
Come on, guys.
Jesus Christ.
Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions.
I'm talking, of course, about Peruvian flute bands.
The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are.
All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometre.
- General?
- France, Japan and the north-eastern United States are currently the hardest hit.
Make no mistake.
This is a pan flute epidemic.
A pandemic?
Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands.
We will need every resource available to see this through.
Excuse me, but...
Aid other countries?
- Senator?
- With all due respect, we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands.
Let other countries fend for themselves.
You heartless bastard.
This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity.
And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands.
Is that clear?
As Director of Homeland Security,
I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained.
Go.
Go.
Serves you right, assholes.
Come on, everybody.
Move.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- One more over here.
- Let's go.
Get them out.
Clear out.
Move.
This is a Homeland Security operation, people.
Let's go.
Hey, back off.
Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained.
There's Sharon and Shelly.
They're watching some television.
Wave to the camera, Shelly.
What are you watching, guys?
- The news.
- Huh?
We're watching the news.
That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.
What do you think about the television, Shelly?
The news is starting.
The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day.
In cities all over the world, flute bands have been removed and quarantined, but more may still be out there.
Homeland Security is requesting that if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it, mark down the flute band's location, and do not under any circumstances buy their CDs.
The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantine area in Miami.
Excuse us.
Hello?
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, there's been a misunderstanding.
Could I talk to you for a minute?
Sir?
Sir, could we talk to you for just a second?
Get back.
I'm not buying any of your damn CDs.
No, sir, there's been a big misunderstanding.
We actually aren't a...
I said I'm not buying any goddamn CDs today.
You got that?
I'm sick of it.
"Hey, Craig.
You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday?
"How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band?
"You can double your money in one afternoon.
"Come on, Craig.
Don't be an asshole."
Attention, Peruvian flute bands.
We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
Tomorrow you will be boarding ships.
Which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
Where you will spend the rest of your lives.
Guantanamo Bay?
We can't go to Guantanamo Bay.
Don't worry, you guys.
I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now, trying to find us.
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son, Craig.
Do you have any idea where they could have gone?
No.
I'm telling you this isn't like Craig at all.
I'm really worried.
- You've checked with the police?
- Nobody knows anything.
It's like the boys just vanished.
None of the other kids have seen them since...
Randy, will you put that thing down?
What is wrong with you?
Our son is missing.
- Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
- Well, then stop being an idiot and help.
Maybe the boys all ran away.
Were any of your boys upset about anything?
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
This is exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is a bad influence on our boys.
Now wait just a minute.
I'm just saying that your son has some problems...
Like every kid doesn't have some problems.
Obviously, Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
- Oh, my God!
- This is good.
Sir, good news.
Looks like we did it.
Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands.
We got them all.
All right!
We did it!
Calm down, people.
We still have work to do.
We have to take out the place these flute bands came from, so they never come again.
We don't know where they came from, sir.
We've been researching, but we can't figure it out.
Well, think about it, idiot.
Where else would Peruvian flute bands come from?
- The country is in the name.
- No, sir, we checked the entire map.
There isn't a country called "Peruvian" anywhere.
Not "Peruvian," retards.
Peru.
It's right here.
"Peru."
Now, I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all.
Is that really necessary, sir?
Seems a little extreme.
Yeah.
Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us
- Unless they are stopped at the source.
- Sir, you better come quick.
One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.
See?
God damn it.
"The Llama Brothers.
Tapas and Moodscapes."
This is a mistake, sir.
We aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
Right.
You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band.
We're just kids, you know?
We were just trying to make some money.
We just want to go home.
Which tourist location were they playing at?
- An outdoor mall in Colorado.
- Look, we're from Colorado.
- We grew up in the United States.
- We speak English.
And we're white.
Let me talk to you guys out here.
- Well, what do you think?
- I don't know what to make of it, sir.
It's like nothing I've ever seen before.
Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band, and yet they aren't.
They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like one of us.
I agree.
They're obviously some kind of hybrid.
A hybrid?
How is that possible?
Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females.
Who knows?
Well, however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had.
Sir?
If they are the hybrid we're talking about, then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?
Because you're always doing stuff like this.
You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something.
That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
You're being extremely negative, Craig.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't,
- But if you help us, we'll get you home.
- Help you how?
You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands.
They see you as one of them.
We are going to send you to their capital.
Can we please just go home, sir?
We still don't know whose side you're on.
You do this and we'll know.
- You leave for Peru in the morning.
- No.
No, I'm not going to Peru.
Not Peru.
- Kyle, calm down.
- You know I can't go there, Stan.
One of our friends was raped in Peru.
It was very traumatic.
You don't have a choice.
Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
Thompson, can you come over here?
The flute band players won't shut up about something, and I can't understand them.
They're saying something like,
"You can't send us away.
We are the protectors."
Protectors from what?
- What does that mean?
- I think he said "the furry death."
This is CNN.
The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world.
Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade, and, Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect.
Really welcome silence, Tom.
There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace.
The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the...
What the...
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ.
There's something else here.
It's not a Peruvian flute band.
It's like...
- Oh, my God!
What is that thing?
- Paul, what are you seeing?
It's furry.
It's very furry.
Okay.
Obviously something different has shown up.
Did he say "furry"?
Okay, we're experiencing some...
Oh, my God!
What is that thing?
All right, we're about 800 kilometres from Peru.
There'll be a truck to take you inside the border, where you'll be briefed on mission specifics.
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said,
"Hey, you know, this plan might backfire"?
No, that never occurs to you.
Because you guys are jerks and you never learn from your mistakes.
And that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
That's not true.
Kids at school like us.
Don't they?
Yeah, dude, kids at school totally like us.
Craig's just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
I'm being a dick?
Yes.
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
- There's no talking to this guy.
- All right, fine, Craig.
When we get back home, we'll get you your money back and we'll never talk to you again.
How's that?
That would be great.
Thank you.
This is wrong.
This just doesn't make any sense.
Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
I don't know.
It just feels like there's got to be something else going on here.
Please, I don't know where else to turn.
The police haven't been any help.
I think our boys might really be in trouble this time.
Yes, yes.
Please check and call me right back.
Thank you.
Randy, I swear to God, if you don't put that thing away...
Sharon, you're going to be glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
I mean it, Randy, that's enough!
You don't have to videotape every single...
What the hell was that?
Oh, my God!
Something's going on outside.
Stay here.
- What's going on, Dad?
- Get back to your room, Shelly.
- What's going on?
- They're all over the place.
- What are?
- They're really furry.
What did that?
What is that thing?
Mr. Marsh, you have to move.
It isn't safe to be here.
Oh, my God!
Go, go, go!
Go back the other way.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God, I'm so startled.
- Sir, we've got a bigger problem.
- And what might that be?
New reports are coming in from cities all over the world.
Word of massive destruction and death by what appear to be...
Guinea pigs?
Yes, sir.
How did you know?
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis.
Did you know that?
- Sir?
- I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.
You...
You knew this was going to happen.
This is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere.
Sorry, my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen.
The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this is on his way to the middle of nowhere.

"Pandemic (Part 1)"
I don't get it, Kenny.
Why did you buy razors and shaving cream?
'Cuz, dude, I'm gonna shave my balls.
Shave your balls?
Why would you shave your balls?
Because girls like shaved balls.
- Girls like shaved balls?
- Yes, they do.
What girl is gonna see your balls?
I don't know.
Oh, Jesus, there's another one!
Another pan flute band.
Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately?
Yeah, I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday.
All their crappy music sounds the same.
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
I think Kenny likes it.
- I gotta get home for dinner.
- Yeah, me too.
God!
Shut up already!
I'm outta here.
See you guys.
Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London!
London has something for everyone.
Sights.
Theater.
And wonderful street performers.
- They're in London, too?
- Hey, time for dinner, guys.
- All right, kids.
Dig in.
- Where's Dad?
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
Why?
Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera, he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
All right, here we are!
Marsh family gathered for another dinner.
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
- There's Shelley.
- You excited about dinner, Shelley?
Turn it off, Dad!
Oh, look!
Stan's eating a tater tot.
Wave to the camera, Stan!
Jesus Christ!
Oh, neat-o!
It's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands!
Stan, go out and stand with 'em.
I can get a shot.
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces.
Screw you, Kyle.
- And all right, your turn, Kenny.
- You guys!
You guys, check this out.
I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night!
So?
So I just sat there and watched them for a while.
Guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
- How much?
- Over $200 bucks!
- $200?
- Really, are you sure?
Yeah dude, I'm starting to realize it's like the easiest job in the world, you know?
I mean we could do that!
- Become a Peruvian flute band?
- Yeah!
Why not?
We get some instruments and some costumes and then make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Oh, my God!
We're gonna make so much fucking money, you guys!
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo!
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and instruments?
Craig, dude.
How you doing, bro?
- Fine.
- Cool.
Awesome!
Craig, remember you were telling us how your grandma gave you $100 bucks for your birthday?
Craig, how would you like to turn that $100 into $1,000?
Come on in, Craig.
Have a seat!
Welcome.
What do you guys want?
Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
All right, Craig!
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig.
Because they make bank.
We just need your money to buy instruments and make CDs.
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
You guys never hang out with me, you never invite me to do stuff, but now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me $100.
Craig, don't be an asshole.
I'll go get the money.
All right, guys.
Just like we rehearsed it!
You ready, Craig?
All right, let's jam!
And a one, and a two, and a...
Wow, that's such cultural music.
Very cultural, yes.
Por favor, buy our CDs de musica!
Gracias!
How cultural!
This is awesome!
You see, Craig?
Hey, you guys can't play here!
We were here first!
No trabajar aqui!
Vaya!
No playa la musica en la promenade!
No es bueno!
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf.
You got that?
- Goddammit!
- No!
No es bueno!
Come on, guys!
Jesus Christ!
No!
No es bueno!
No trabajar aqui!
Ladies and gentlemen,our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions.
I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands.
The red dots indicate where the highest concentration of Peruvian bands are.
All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now on average
65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer.
General?
France, Japan, and the northeastern US are currently the hardest hit.
Make no mistake...
This is a pan flute epidemic.
A pandemic?
Three countries in Asia, and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands.
We will need every resource available to see this through.
Excuse me, but aid other countries?
Senator?
With all due respect, we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands.
Let other countries fend for themselves.
You heartless bastard.
This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity.
And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands.
Is that clear?
As director of Homeland Security,
I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained.
Go, go!
Serves you right, assholes.
Let's go!
Let's go!
One more over here!
Let's go get 'em out!
Clear out.
Move!
This is a Homeland Security operation, people.
Let's go!
Hey, back off!
Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained.
There's Sharon and Shelley.
They're watching some television.
Wave to the camera, Shelley!
What are you watching, guys?
The news.
We're watching the news.
That's the TV in our living room.
Still showing commercials right now.
What you think about the television, Shelley?
The news is starting!
The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day.
In cities all over the world, flute bands have been removed and quarantined, but more may still be out there.
Homeland Security is requesting that if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it.
Mark down the flute band's location and do not under any circumstances, buy their CDs.
The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantine area in Miami.
Excuse us.
Hello?
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, there's been a misunderstanding.
Could I talk to you for a minute?
Sir, sir, could we talk to you for just a second?
Get back!
I'm not buying any of your damn CDs!
No, sir, there's been a big misunderstanding.
We actually aren't a Peruvian--
I said I'm not buying any goddamn CDs today!
You got that?
I'm sick of it!
Señor!
Comprar CD la musica?
Jesus Christ!
He shot that guy!
Hey, Craig.
You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday?
How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band?
You can double your money in one afternoon.
Come on, Craig.
Don't be an asshole.
Attention, Peruvian flute bands...
Attenciones, bandas de flauta Peru.
We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
Cooporation y paciencia es apreciado!
Tomorrow, you will be boarding ships.
Manana, sera el ambarque de barcos!
Which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
Que le llevara a bahia Guantanamo!
Where you will spend the rest of your lives.
Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas!
Gracias!
Guantanamo Bay?
We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
Don't worry.
I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig.
Do you have any idea where they could have gone?
No!
I'm telling you this isn't like Craig at all.
- I'm really worried!
- You've checked with the police?
Nobody knows anything.
It's like the boys just vanished.
None of the other kids have seen them since the...
Randy, will you put that thing down?
What is wrong with you?
Our son is missing!
Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
Well, then stop being an idiot and help!
Maybe the boys all ran away.
Were any of your boys upset about anything?
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
This is exactly why I've told Kyle not to hang around that boy!
What is that supposed to mean?
To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is a bad influence on our boys.
Now wait just a minute!
I'm just saying that your son has some problems.
Like every kid doesn't have some problems!
Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, this is good!
That's not ridiculous.
Sir, good news.
Looks like we did it.
Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands.
We got 'em all.
All right!
We did it!
Thank God!
Calm down, people.
We still have work to do.
We have to take out the place these flute bands came from, so they never come again.
We don't know where they came from, sir.
We've been researching, but we can't figure it out.
Well, think about it, idiot.
Where else would Peruvian flute bands come from?
The country is in the name!
No, sir, we checked the entire map.
There isn't a country called "Peruvian" anywhere.
Not "Peruvian", retards.
Peru!
It's right here!
Peru.
Now I want a plan in place to take Peru out once and for all.
Is that really necessary, sir?
- It seems a little extreme.
- Yeah.
Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us unless they are stopped at the source!
Sir, you better come quick.
One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.
You see?
Goddammit!
"The Llama Brothers.
Tapas and Moodscapes."
This is a mistake, sir.
We aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
Right.
You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with an llama but you're not a Peruvian flute band.
We're just kids, you know?
We were just trying to make some money.
We just want to go home!
Sir, please.
I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.
Which tourist location were they playing at?
An outdoor mall in Colorado.
Look, we're from Colorado.
We grew up in the United States!
- We speak English!
- And we're white!
Let me talk to you guys out here.
- What do you think?
- I don't know what to make of it, sir.
It's like nothing I've ever seen before.
Clearly, they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they aren't.
They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like...
- one of us.
- I agree.
They are obviously some kind of hybrid.
A hybrid?
How is that possible?
Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females.
Who knows?
Well however, they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had.
Sir?
If they are the hybrid we're talking about, then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?
Because you're always doing stuff like this.
You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something and then it backfires and then you end up in a foreign country or in outer space or something.
That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
You're being extremely negative, Craig.
All right, here's the deal.
Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us,
- we'll get you home.
- Help you how?
You are able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands.
They see you as one of them.
We are going to send you to their capital.
Can we please just go home, sir?
We still don't know who's side you're on!
You do this and we'll know.
You leave for Peru in the morning.
No.
No, I'm not going to Peru!
- Not Peru!
- Kyle, calm down.
You know I can't go there, Stan!
One of our friends was raped in Peru.
It was very traumatic.
You don't have a choice.
Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
Thompson, can you come over here?
The flute band players won't shut up about something
- and I can't understand them.
- Por favor!
No podemos ir!
Estamos aqui para proteger a ustedes!
- Si, no podemis ir!
- Que son protectores.
They're saying something like you can't send us away.
- We are the protectors.
- Protectors from what?
La muerte peludo!
La muerte peludo!
- What does that mean?
- I think he said,
"the furry death."
La muerte peludo!
La muerte peludo!
This is CNN.
The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world.
Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade.
And Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect?
Really welcome silence, Tom.
There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now and everyone is really been enjoying the peace.
The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the--
What the...?
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!
There's something else here!
It's not a Peruvian flute band.
It's...
Oh, my God.
What is that thing?
What are you seeing?
It's furry.
It's very furry!
Okay.
Obviously something different has shown up.
Did he say "furry"?
Okay, we are experiencing some...
My God!
What is that thing?
All right.
We're about 800 kilometers from Peru.
There will be a truck to take you inside the border where you'll be briefed on mission specifics.
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said, "Hey, you know,
"this plan might backfire?"
No, that never occurs to you.
Because you guys are jerks and you never learn from your mistakes.
And that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
That's not true!
Kids at school like us!
Don't they?
Yeah, dude, kids at school totally like us.
Craig's just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
I'm being a dick.
Yes!
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the county of Peru and I'm being a dick.
- There's no talking to this guy.
- All right, fine, Craig.
When we get back home, we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again.
How's that?
That would be great.
Thank you.
This is wrong.
This just doesn't make any sense.
Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
Because they were starting to take over the world?
I don't know.
It just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
Please, I don't know where else to turn.
The police haven't been any help.
I think our boys might really be in trouble this time.
Yes, please check and call me right back.
Thank you.
Randy, I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...
Sharon, you're going to be really glad
I have all this footage of the family some day.
I mean it, Randy.
That's enough!
You don't have to videotape every single...
What the hell was that?
Oh, my God!
Something's going on outside.
Stay here.
- What's going on, Dad?
- Get back to your room, Shelley!
- What's going on?
- They're all over the place!
- What are?
- They're really furry!
What did that?
What is that thing?
Mr. Marsh, you have to move.
It isn't safe to be here.
Oh, my God!
Go, go back the other way!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
I'm so... startled.
Sir, we've got a bigger problem.
And what might that be?
New reports are coming in from cities all over the world.
Word of massive destruction and death by what appear to be...
Guinea pigs?
Yes, sir.
How did you know?
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis.
Did you know that?
Sir?
I really thought you had me at Miami.
But you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.
You...
You... knew this was going to happen.
Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis.
And I can't let you interfere.
Sorry, my friend.
But I've work too hard to make all this happen.
The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising.
And the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere.

I don't get it, kenny.
Why did you buy razors and shaving cream?
'Cuz, dude, I'm gonna shave my balls.
Shave your balls?
Why would you shave your balls?
Because girls like shaved balls.
Girls like shaved balls?
Yes, they do.
What girl is gonna see your balls?
I don't know.
Oh, jesus, there's another one!
Another pan flute band.
Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately?
Yeah, I saw like three of those bands down in denver yesterday.
All their crappy music sounds the same.
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
I think kenny likes it.
I gotta get home for dinner.
Yeah, me too.
God!
Shut up already!
I'm outta here.
See you guys.
Tonight, the travel channel takes you to london!
London has something for everyone.
Sights.
Theater.
And wonderful street performers.
They're in london, too?
Hey, time for dinner, guys.
All right, kids.
Dig in.
Where's dad?
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
Why?
Because ever since your father got this stupid video camera, he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
All right, here we are!
Marsh family gathered for another dinner.
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
There's shelley.
You excited about dinner, shelley?
Turn it off, dad!
Oh, look!
Stan's eating a tater tot.
Wave to the camera, stan!
Aw, jesus christ!
Oh, neat-o!
It's one of those peruvian pan flute bands!
Stan, go out and stand with 'em so I can get a shot.
I will play this card to move kyle back seven spaces.
Screw you, kyle.
And all right, your turn, kenny.
You guys!
You guys, check this out.
I saw another peruvian flute band outside my house last night!
So?
So I just sat there and watched them for a while.
Guess how much money they made selling their crappy cds?
How much?
Over $200 bucks!
- $200?
- Really, are you sure?
I'm starting to realize it's like the easiest job in the world.
You know?
I mean we could do that!
Become a peruvian flute band?
Yeah!
Why not?
We get some instruments and some costumes and then make some crappy pan flute music cds on my computer.
Oh, my god!
We're gonna make so much [Bleep] Money, you guys!
Yeah!
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and instruments?
Craig, dude, how you doing, bro?
Fine.
Oh, cool.
Awesome!
Um, craig, remember you were telling us how your grandma gave you $100 bucks for your birthday?
Yeah.
Craig, how would you like to turn that $100 into $1,000?
Come on in, craig, have a seat!
Welcome.
What do you guys want?
Craig, we have chosen you to join our peruvian flute band!
Oh, all right, craig!
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
There's a reason they're everywhere, craig.
Because they make bank.
We just need your money to buy some instruments and make some cds.
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, craig.
You guys never hang out with me, you never invite me to do stuff, but now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me $100.
Craig, don't be an asshole.
I'll go get the money.
All right, guys.
Just like we rehearsed it!
You ready, craig?
All right, let's jam!
And a one, and a two, and a --
Wow, that's such cultural music.
Very cultural, yes.
Pro favor, buy our cds de musica!
THE LLAMA BROTHERS TAPAS AND MOODSCAPES
Gracias!
How cultural!
This is awesome!
You see, craig?
Hey, you guys can't play here.
We were here first!
No trabajar aqui!
Via!
No playa la musica en la promenade!
No es bueno!
This is our peruvian flute band's turf.
You got that?
Goddammit!
No!
No es bueno!
Come on, guys!
Jesus christ!
No!

Get back to your room, shelley!
What's going on?
They're all over the place!
What are?
They're really furry!
What did that?
What is that thing?
Mr. Marsh, you have to move.
It isn't safe to be here.
Oh, my god!
Go, go, go back the other way!
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
I'm so startled.
Sir, we've got a bigger problem.
And what might that be?
News reports are coming in from cities all over the world.
Word of massive destruction and death by what appear to be --
Guinea pigs?
Yes, sir.
How did you know?
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis,did you know that?
Sir?
I really thought you had me in Miami..
but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together
You...
You.. knew this was going to happen..
Oh,this is only the beginning,Davis.
And I can't let you interfere.
Sorry my friend but I've worked too hard to make all this happen.
The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, and the guinea pigs are rising.
And the only person who could have stopped all this is on his his way to the middle of nowhere...
I don't get it, Kenny.
Why do you buy razors and shavind cream.
[mumbles]
Shave your balls?
Why would you shave your balls?
[mumbles]
Girls like shaved balls?
[mumbles]
What girl is gonna see your balls?
[mumbles]
Oh, Jesus, there's another one.
Another penflu band.
Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately?
Yeah, I saw like three of those bands down at ... yesterday.
All their crappy music sounds the same.
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go.
I think Kenny likes it.
I gotta get home for dinner.
Yeah, me too.
God!
Shut up already.
I'm outta here, see you guys.
Tonight.
The travel channel takes you to London.
London has something for everyone.
Sights, cinema and wonderful street performers.
They're in London too?
!
Time for dinner guys.
All right, kids, dig in.
Where's dad?
He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in a bathtub.
Why?
Because ever since you father got that stupid videocamera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
All right, here we are.
Marsh family gathered for another dinner.
Randy, there's plenty of video of us eating dinner.
There's Shelly!
Excited about dinner, Shelly?
Cut it off, dad!
Oh, look, Stanley's eating a ... Wake to the camera, Stan.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, Nido, it's one of those peruvian penflu bands.
Stan, go out and stand with them so I could get a shot.
I would play this card to move Kyle back sever spaces.
Screw you, Kyle.
Eh, all right, your turn, Kenny.
You guys, you guys, check this out.
I saw another peruvian flu band outside my house last night.
- So?
- So, so I've just set there and watched them for a while.
Guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs.
- How much?
- Over 200 bucks.
- Two hundred dollars?
- Really?
You sure?
Yeah, dude.
I'm certain to realize it's like easiest job in the world, you know.
I mean we could do that.
- Become a peruvian flu band?
- Yeah, why not?
We get some instruments and some costumes and then make some crappy penflu music CDs on my computer.
Oh my god!
We are gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
- Yeah!
Woo -hoo!
But where we gonna get the money to buy costumes and the instruments?
Craig, dude, how you're doing, bro?
- Fine.
- Cool, awesome.
Am, Craig, remember you were telling us how your grandma gave you a 100 bucks for your birthday?
- Yeah.
Craig, how would you like to turn that $100 into a $1000?
Come on in, Craig, have a seat.
Welcome.
What do you guys want?
Craig, we've chosen you to join our peruvian flu band.
All right, Craig!
You mean like those guys you see at all tourist spots?
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig, because they make bank!
We just need your money to buy some instruments and make some CDs.
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
You guys never hang out with me, you never invite me to do stuff but now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me $100.
Craig, don't be an asshole.
I'll go get the money.
All right, guys, just like we rehearsed.
You ready, Craig?
All right, let's jam.
And the one, and the two, and the--
Wow, that's such cultural music.
Very cultural, yes.
Por favor, buy our CDs da musica.
Gracias.
How cultural.
This is awesome.
You see, Craig?
Hey!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey.
Hey you guys cannot play here.
We were here first.
[speaks spanish]
Not play-a la musica in la promenad.
No es bueno!
This is our peruvian flu band turf.
You got that?
God damn it.
No!
No es bueno!
C'mon guys.
Jesus Christ!
[speaks spanish]
Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing and economic and ecological crysis of disasterous proportions.
I'm talking of course about peruvian flute bands.
The red dots indicate where's the highest concentrations of peruvian bands are.
All over the world wherever there are tourists or shoppers there are now on average 65 peruvian flute bands per sq. kilometer.
- General?
- France, Japan and the north-eastern US are currently the hardest hit.
Make no mistake.
This is the pan flute epidemic.
A pandemic?
Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their peruvian flute bands.
We will need every resource available to see this through.
Excuse me, but-- Aid other countries?
- Senator?
- With all due respect, we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands.
Let other countries fend for themself.
You heartless bastard!
This country was founded in beliefs of freedom and integrity and we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by peruvian flute bands.
Is that clear?
As director of homeland security I'm taking control of the military until the crysis is contained.
Go!
Go!
Huh!
Sort you right assholes.
One more over here.
Let's go, get them out.
Clear up, move, this is homeland security operation, people.
Let's go!
Hey!
Back off!
Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained.
There's Sharon and Shelly.
They're watching some television.
Wave to the camera, Shelly.
What are you watching guys?
- The news.
- Huh?
We're watching the news.
Tht's the TV in our living room still showing commercials right now.
What do you thing about the television, Shelly?
Ah, the news is starting.
The government efforts to stop the peruvian flute band crysis are now on their third day.
In cities all over the world flute bands are being removed and quarantined.
But more may still be out there.
Homeland security's requesting that if you see a peruvian flute band, do not approach it mark down the flute band's location and do not under any circumstations buy their CDs.
The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to the quarantine area in Miami.
Excuse us, hello?
Excuse me, sir?
Sir?
There's been a misunderstanding.
Can-
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sir?
Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
Get back, I'm not buying any of your damned CDs.
No, sir, there's been a big misunderstanding, we actually aren't a peruvian
I've said I'm not buying any goddamned CDs today, you got that?
I'm sick of it.
[speaking spanish] [mumbles]
Hey, Craig, you know that money you grandma gave you for your bithday?
How would you like to invest in a peruvian flute band?
You can double your money in one afternoon, c'mon Craig, don't be an asshole.
Attention peruvian flute bands!
[translates into spanish]
We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
[translates into spanish]
Tomorrow you will be boarding ships.
[translates into spanish]
Which will take you to Guantanamo bay.
[translates into spanish]
Where you will spend the rest of your lives.
[translates into spanish]
Guantanamo bay?
We can't go to the Guantanamo bay!
Don't worry you guys.
I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
Please, mr. and mrs.
Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig.
Do you have any idea where they could have gone?
No!
I'm telling you, this isn't like Craig at all.
I'm really worried.
You've checked with the police?
Nobody knows anything, it's like the boys just wanished.
None of the other kids have seen them since-
- Randy, would you put that thing down?
!
What is wrong with you?
Our son is missing!
Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
Well then stop being an idiot and help!
Maybe the boys aren't ran away.
When have your boys upset about anything?
All we know was they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
This exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
What is that supposed to mean?
To be honest, mrs.
Tucker, we think Craig has a bad influence on our boys.
Now wait just a minute!
I'm just saying that your son has some problems.
Like every kid doesn't have some problems.
Obviously, Craig has gotten them into some kind of problems.
Oh my god!
Oh, this is good.
Sir, good news!
Looks like we did it.
Every major city is reporting zero peruvian flute bands.
We've got them all.
Calm down people, we still have work to do.
We have to take out the place this flute bands came from so they never come again.
We don't know where they came from, sir.
We've been researching but we can't figure it out.
Well, think about it idiot.
Where else would peruvian flute bands come from?
- Hmmm--
- The country is in the name!
No, sir.
We checked the entire map, there isn't a coutry named Peruvian anywhere.
Not Peruvian, retards, Peru!
It's right here.
PE-RU
Now I want a plan and place to take out Peru once and for all.
- Is that really necessary, sir?
Seems a little extreme.
- Yeah.
Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us unless they are stopped at the source.
Sir, you better come quick.
One of the panflute bands was trying to escape.
See?
God damn it!
The llama brothers, tapas and moodscapes.
This is a mistake, sir.
We aren't really a peruvian flute band.
Right.
You just play panflute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a lama, but you are not a peruvian flute band.
We-
- We just kids, you know.
We just trying to get some money.
We just wanna go home.
[mumbles]
Which tourist location were they playing at?
In outdoor mall in Colorado.
Look, we're from Colorado.
We-
- We grew up in the US.
- We speak english.
- And we're white.
Let me talk to you guys out here.
- Well, what do you think?
- I don't know what to make of it, sir.
It's like nothing I've ever seen before.
Clearly they are a peruvian flute band and yet they aren't.
They play panflute music like the others but they talk and act like one of us.
I agree.
They obviously some kind of-- hybrid.
A hybrid?
How was that possible?
Perhaps a peruvian flute band made it with one of our females, who knows.
Sir, if they are the hybrid we're talking about, then they could be our way of taking out Peru, once and for all.
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?
Because you always do stuff like this.
You always coming up with some stupid idea to do something and then it backfires and then you end up in some foreign country or outer space or something.
That's why noone likes hanging out with you guys.
You're being extremely negative, Craig.
All right, here's the deal.
Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us, we'll get you home.
Help you how?
You're able to walk amongst the peruvian flute bands, they see you as one of them.
We're going to send you to their capital.
Can we please just go home, sir?
We still don't know whose side you're on.
You do this and we'll know.
You leave for Peru in the morning.
No, no, I'm not going to Peru, not Peru!
- Kyle, calm down.
- You know, I can't go there, Stan!
One of our friends was raped in Peru, it was very dramatic.
You don't have a choice.
Either you go to Peru or you get up locked forever with the other flute bands.
Thompson, can you get over there?
The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them.
[speaks spanish]
They're saying something "You can't send us away, we're the protectors"
Protectors from what?
[speaks spanish]
- What's that mean?
- I think he's said "The Furry Death"
[speaks spanish]
This is CNN
Last of peruvian flute band have successfuly been eradicated from every part of the world.
Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and-
- Paul?
Pretty nice not have any peruvian music I suspect?
Really welcome silence, Tom.
There hasn't been a peruvian panflute band in sight for days now and everyone's enjoying the peace.
The world breathe a collective relief now as we thank--
What the--
Oh my god-- Jesus-
- AAAARGH
There's-
- There's something else here, it's-- it's not a peruvian flute band, it's like--
Oh my god, what is that thing?
- Paul, what do you see?
- It's furry, it's really furry(?
)!
Okay, obviously something different has shown up--
Did he said furry?
Okay.
We're-
- We're experiencing some--
Oh my god, what is that thing?
All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru.
There'll be a truck to take you inside the border while you'll be briefed on mission specifics.
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know, this plan may backfire"
No, that never accused to you, because you guys are jerks and you never learn from your mistakes.
And that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
That's not true, kids at school like us, don't they?
Yeah, dude.
Kids at school totally like us, Craig just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
- I'm being a dick?
- Yes!
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru.
And I'm being a dick?
Let's no talking to this guy.
All right, fine, Craig.
When we get back home, we'll get you your money back and will never talk to you again.
How's that?
That would be great.
Thank you.
This is wrong.
This just doesn't make any sense.
Why would homeland security send us into Peru?
[mumbles]
I don't know, it just feels like-- there's got to be something else going on here.
Please, I don't know where else to turn.
The police haven't been any help.
I think our boys might really be in trouble this time.
Yes.
Yes, please, check and call me right back.
Thank you.
Randy, I swear to god, if you don't put that thing away--
Sharon, you goona be really glad I have all this footage of the family some day.
I mean it, Randy.
That's enough.
You don't have to videotape every single--
What the hell was that?
- Oh my god.
- Something's going on outside.
Stay here.
- What's going on, dad?
- Get back to your room, Shelly.
- What's going on?
- They are all over the place.
- What are?
- The really furry(?
).
What did that?
What is that thing?
Mr. Marsh you have to move, it isn't safe to be--
Oh my god!
Go-go-go, go back the other way!
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god!
I'm so-- startled.
Sir, we've got a bigger problem.
Oh?
And what might that be?
New reports are coming in from cities all over the world.
Word of massive destruction of what appear to be--
Kenny(?
) pigs?
Yes sir!
How did you know?
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davies.
Did you know that?
- Sir?
- I've really thought you got me in Miami.
But you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.
You-
- You knew this was going to happen.
Oh, this is only the beginning, Davies.
And I can't let you interfere.
Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen.
The panflute bands are on their way to their deaths, the kenny pigs arising and the only person who could have stop all this is on his way to the middle of nowhere.
Season 12 Episode 10 "Pandemic"
I don't get it, Kenny.
Why did you buy razors and shaving cream?
(Because, dude, I'm gonna shave my balls.)
Shave your balls?
Why would you shave your balls?
(Because girls like shaved balls.)
- Girls like shaved balls?
- (Yes, they do.)
- What girl is gonna see your balls?
- (I don't know.)
Oh, Jesus, there's another one!
Another pan flute band.
Have you noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately?
Yeah, I saw three of those bands in Denver yesterday.
All their crappy music sounds the same.
I'm sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!

Aw, Jesus Christ!
Oh, neat-o!

Stan, go out and stand with them so I can get a shot.
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces.
Screw you, Kyle.
- And all right, your turn, Kenny.
- You guys!
Check this out.
I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night!
- So?
- So I watched them for a while.
Guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
- How much?
- Over $200!
- $200?
- Really, are you sure?
Yeah.
I'm starting to realize it's like the easiest job in the world.
I mean, we could do that!
- Become a Peruvian flute band?
- Yeah!
Why not?
We get some instruments and costumes, then make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Oh, my God!
We're gonna make so much fucking money, you guys!
Yeah!
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and instruments?
Craig, dude, how you doing, bro?
- Fine.
- Cool.
Awesome!
Craig, remember you were telling us how your grandma gave you $100 for your birthday?
Yeah.
Craig, how would you like to turn that $100 into $1,000?
- Come on in, have a seat!
Welcome.

We're just kids, you know?
We were trying to make some money.
We just want to go home!
(Please.
I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)

It was very traumatic.
You don't have a choice.
Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
Thompson, can you come over here?
The flute band players won't shut up and I can't understand them.
{\¡Por favor!
¡No podemos ir!
}
{\¡Estamos aqui para proteger a ustedes!
}
{\- ¡Si, no podemis ir!
- Que son protectores.}
They're saying something like, "You can't send us away."
- "We are the protectors."
- Protectors from what?
{\¡La muerte peluda!
¡La muerte peluda!
}
- What does that mean?
- I think he said...
"The Furry Death?"
{\¡La muerte peluda!
¡La muerte peluda!
}
This is CNN.
The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world.
Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade.
Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect?
Really welcome silence, Tom.
There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now and everyone has really been enjoying the peace.
The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the-
What the-
Oh, my God!
Jesus Christ!
There's something else here!
It's not a Peruvian flute band.
It's- oh, my God.
What is that thing?
- Paul, what are you seeing?
- It's furry.
It's very furry!
Okay.
Obviously something different has shown up.
Did he say "furry?"
Okay, we are experiencing some-
Oh, my God!
What is that thing?
All right.
We're about 800 kilometers from Peru.
There will be a truck to take you inside where you'll be briefed on mission specifics.
Was there ever a moment when you first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band, that any of you said,
"Hey, you know, this plan might backfire?"
No, that never occurs to you.
Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes.
And that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
That's not true!
- Kids at school like us!
Don't they?
- Yeah, they totally like us.
Craig's just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
- I'm being a dick?
- Yes!
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru and I'm being a dick.
There's no talking to this guy.
All right.
When we get home we'll get you your money back and never talk to you again.
How's that?
That would be great.
Thank you.
This is wrong.
This just doesn't make any sense.
Why would homeland security send us into Peru?
(Because they were starting to take over the world?
)
I don't know, it feels like, there's got to be something else going on here.
Please, I don't know where else to turn.
The police haven't been any help.
I think our boys might really be in trouble this time.
Yes, please check and call me right back.
Thank you.
Randy, I swear to God if you don't put that thing away-
Sharon, you'll be glad I have all this footage of the family some day.
I mean it.
That's enough!
You don't have to videotape every single-
What the hell was that?
Oh, my God!
Something's going on outside.
Stay here.
- What's going on, dad?
- Get back to your room, Shelley!
- What's going on?
- They're all over the place!
- What are?
- They're really furry!
What did that?
What is that thing?
Mr. Marsh, you have to move.
It isn't safe to be here.
Oh, my God!
Go, go back the other way!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
I'm so... startled.
Sir, we've got a bigger problem.
And what might that be?
News reports are coming in from cities all over the world.
Word of massive destruction and death by what appear to be-
Guinea pigs?
Yes, sir.
How did you know?
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis.
Did you know that?
- Sir?
- I thought you had me in Miami.
But you just couldn't quiet put the pieces together.
You...
You... knew this was going to happen.
Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis.
And I can't let you interfere.
Sorry my friend, but I worked too hard too make all this happen.
The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising.
And the only person who could have stopped all this is on his way to the middle of nowhere.
Winters didn't feel this cold... when I was a child.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Please, this way.
Coming in.
My condolences.
We are here to assist you with encoffining.
May I light up the incense?
Yes.
Thank you for coming.
Looks like she's still alive.
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.
How can you tell?
The body is undamaged.
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.
What a waste, she's beautiful.
Do you want to try?
Yes.
For the deceased's peaceful departure,
I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.
Everyone, please see her off from up close.
I will now begin the cleansing.
It has the thing.
What thing?
The thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing...
Err...
May I have a word with you?
Yes, what is it?
After the cleansing, we apply makeup on the deceased...
We have different makeups for male and female...
Oh... please wait.
Yes.
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?
Men's or girl's?
Come on, which one?
If I gave birth to a girl from the start, this would've never happened...
But thanks to someone's seed...
Girl's is fine then?
Yep.
Female's, please.
Yes.
Tomeo...
"Okuribito"
DEPARTURES
Not many in the audience again today.
Yeah, they should put more effort into advertising.
I know!
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.
My wife's a web designer.
I'll make her do it for free.
What do you think?
More importantly, are you going to be fine?
About what?
Next, the next.
Next what?
You spent so much money on that, gotta start looking for the next one.
Good performance again, everyone.
Good work everyone.
Although the seats were empty...
I think your performances were great.
Um... actually... today... the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki... has something to tell you, so please give him your attention.
You're... disbanded.
See ya.
I finally became an orchestra member.
But it became a past memory in a flash.
This cello is innocent.
Only because it was bought by a loser like me, it lost its job.
In many ways... this cello was too heavy for me.
Thank you very much.
Please cook it immediately.
Yes.
Good bye.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
She gave me an octopus.
I just happened to see our neighbor.
They just caught it this morning.
What's wrong?
Disbanded.
What is?
My orchestra.
I see...
You just have to find the next one.
There won't be a next one.
Someone with my skill level can only go so far... and there's the debt for this cello.
How much?
Don't worry, if it's just around $10,000...
I can pay it back with my job.
$180,000.
$1... $180,000?
Pros all spend that much... it's relatively cheap.
Why did you hide it from me?
I knew you'd be against it.
Why didn't you tell me... about something so important?
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner.
"All the cities around the world are our new homes.
Let's live together on a musical tour."
Those were the words of my marriage proposal.
But the reality is harsh.
No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.
What happened?
This octopus is alive!
You're right.
It's alive.
Hey, Dai... what should we do?
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I think I'll quit.
Quit what?
Cello.
What will you do then?
Go back to the countryside... in Yamagata.
I vote yes!
Huh?
You don't mind?
Well, the house your mom left you... we don't need to pay rent, right?
But you really don't mind?
Yes.
This is a wonderful instrument.
I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life, but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.
As if I was suddenly released from being tied up.
What I believed to be my dream... was probably not my real dream.
The only thing my mother left me, when she died two years ago.
I've been told my father ran the cafe at first, but I have almost no recollection of it.
After he left home for another woman, my mother ran this small cafe, and raised me alone.
Meal's ready.
Okay.
I thought you would hate the countryside more.
No, it's kind of refreshing.
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.
Really?
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.
What will you sell?
This is it!
This, this one!
No age limit, high salary?
In addition, short actual working time?
As a full-time employee!
"NK Agent"?
What kind of company is that?
"A job that helps out journeys."
A travel agency?
Oh, maybe tour guide?
It says "no experience necessary".
I'll go ask for details.
Yeah.
This is it.
Excuse me.
Is this "NK Agent"?
Yes...
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.
Oh, you're here for the interview!
The boss will be back soon, sit here.
Yes, thank you.
I... was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.
Oh...
It's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.
Um... what does this company do?
What?
You came without knowing anything?
It said to help out with journeys...
Uh... that's not what you do?
Boss, he's here for the interview.
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.
Oh, it's you.
You seem more energetic than on the phone.
Thank you.
See?
It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.
Yes.
I brought my resume just in case.
Okay, sit down.
Thank you.
Can you put in lots of hours here?
Huh?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
Eh?
What's your name again?
It's Kobayashi Daigo.
Order his business cards right away.
Got it.
W... wait...
We haven't discussed anything...
salaries and other things...
Oh, right.
Let's start with one hand.
"One hand"?
$500?
$5000.
$5000?
!
Too little?
Not at all, I can get that much?
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?
Let's see...
As my assistant at first.
Exactly what...?
To be exact... encoffining.
Encoffining?
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.
It's starting to bloom!
Corpse as in dead people?
You ask funny questions.
No, uh, um...
The job posting said helping out journeys.
I assumed it was a travel agency...
Oh, this is a misprint.
Misprint?
Not "helping out journeys", it's...
"Helping out peaceful departure".
Departure?
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.
This is for today.
No, I can't...
Don't worry!
No...
I'm back.
Welcome back.
Here.
Where did you get this?
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?
Yonezawa-beef?
The highest-grade sirloin.
Wow!
Was it expensive?
I got paid in advance.
You got the job?
Kind of, yes.
Great!
Let's celebrate today.
Sure.
So, what kind of job was it?
Tour guide after all?
Not really...
Sales?
What's the matter?
It wasn't a travel agency.
Oh?
What was it?
Ceremonial event-related...
Like a wedding hall?
Yeah.
They might make you play the cello again!
I'll make sukiyaki right away.
Okay.
This is great!
Looks tasty.
I don't think I'll come back that late.
Get going.
Bye.
Morning.
Hello.
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.
Your business cards are ready.
No misprints.
Are these that uncommon?
This is my first time seeing a real one.
First time?
Yes.
My grandparents passed away before I'd grown up, and my mother passed away while I was abroad.
She was already in her grave when I got back.
What about your father?
He left home for another woman when I was 6.
Your mother must have been lonely.
But...
I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before... can really do this job?
You'll get used to it!
To dead bodies?
Yeah.
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy... but change of season...
Do you need help?
...will be very busy for us.
Where does work come from?
Funeral homes.
Funeral homes?
Yes.
Encoffining... used to be done by family members.
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes, then companies like ours appeared.
In short, it's a super-niche industry.
It's pretty heavy.
There are many kinds of coffins.
$500, $1000, $3000.
They differ by that much?
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and carvings on both sides.
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.
Yes, they all burn the same way.
Same ashes.
The last shopping of your life is done by others.
Kind of ironic.
Right.
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Yes, he's here.
Yes, Minato Theater?
Immediately?
Okay.
Is that the boss?
A job.
A job?
Are you from NK?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, there he is.
He's a newcomer to our company...
Kobayashi.
His name is Kobayashi, the model for today.
Good luck everyone!
Model?
We're going to film right after you finish changing.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Get changed and makeup over there.
Makeup?
Yes.
Boss...
Don't worry.
Go ahead.
Okay.
[ Encoffining Manual ] ...first apply cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Followed by...
The model is coming out!
Not bad.
Um... who's going to see this video?
Don't worry, it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.
In encoffining, we first perform cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust... and also symbolizes the first bath for a new birth.
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing, but for sanitary reasons, nowadays, we use sterilized cloths... to wipe... the body.
Clothing ritual is performed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives... we perform it with utmost care.
After the preparation, we shave the face before applying makeup.
Males in particular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin, it seems as if they have a long mustache, so we shave them thoroughly.
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.
Therefore, we perform it with caution and care...
Ow!
What the...
Ow, ow!
Uh, oh.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!
Uh, oh...
Ow, ow!
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's not so bad.
Welcome home.
I'm home.
What is it?
What happened to your face?
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.
You were shaving at work?
Yeah.
You only use electric shavers at home...
I had no choice, the boss ordered me to do it.
Don't worry, it's not so bad.
Weird company.
No kidding.
Weird... weird company.
The first job came without a warning.
Um... what should I do?
For today... you just have to watch.
Okay.
But man... we hit a bad one.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Well, you'll see.
Don't scare me like that!
Thank you for waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Where is the body?
An old lady living by herself...
dead for two weeks.
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful.
See you later.
Who is he?
From the funeral home.
Our employer.
Let's get started.
It stinks!
Ugh.
This way.
Eh?
Help out a little.
Yes.
Hold her feet.
Her feet!
Yes.
You said I only have to watch...
Slowly... gently...
Come on, hold them!
Yes.
Wait, wait...
You can go home for today.
It was a bit too intense for the first job.
Really?
Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!
Hey, did you eat something weird?
No.
Something smells.
Must be your scarf!
No way!
That guy wearing black, he smells!
Ah!
It's still here!
Leave it over there.
Yes.
$3.
Okay.
Thanks.
Towels for $1.
Okay.
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.
I refuse to quit.
Leave already.
I just want the best for you.
You talk just like a civil servant!
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!
Right?
Shiori?
Can I come for the big bath again?
Yes, of course!
For you, grandma will work hard!
Daigo...
Yamashita.
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!
Sorry, I've been busy.
Oh!
You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It sure has been!
I hear you have an amazing job!
Huh?
Well... yes...
What is that instrument called?
Cello, that monster-sized violin.
Right, cello!
He's a great man.
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
If only my son was as talented as he is!
Mom...
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...
Sure, next time.
Bring your wife here next time.
You're married, right?
Yes.
This place is very peaceful without this fool.
Which fool gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!
Oh, I got it!
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I finally figured it out.
Something happen at work?
No.
Let's eat!
Yeah.
Let's eat...
Our neighbor gave it to me.
Oh.
It was just slaughtered this morning, so it's really fresh!
She said we can even eat it raw!
Maybe we should wait a little longer.
Hey...
Are you ok?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dai, you're acting strange...
Hey, come on, Dai...
Hey, you're embarrassing me.
Not here...
Dai?
Hey, wait...
Mika...
Mika...
What exactly... am I being tested for?
Is this my punishment for not seeing my mother off?
What will happen to me?
Strangely, thinking about it made me want to play the cello.
I simply wanted to play the cello while reminiscing my past.
It's so small...
Salmons?
Ah, yes.
They're right by the rocks... over there.
Oh!
Go for it!
It's kind of sad... to climb only to die.
Why work so hard if you're going to die anyway?
I'm sure they want to go back... to their birthplace.
Let's go for lunch.
Lunch.
It's an order from your boss.
Is this a coincidence?
Huh?
That you happened to pass through here.
It's fate.
There's no such thing...
This is your god-given job.
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.
They're angry!
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!
Sorry.
You're late.
It's 5 minutes past already!
I apologize.
You people make a living from the dead.
Brother...
Hurry up, damn it.
I sincerely apologize.
Is there a lipstick your wife liked to use?
What?
To revive a cold body, and grant eternal beauty.
It was calm and precise.
And more than anything, it was filled with affection.
To be present at the last farewell, and send off the deceased.
It was tranquil, and every action seemed elegant.
Thank you very much.
Please allow me to close the lid.
Naomi...
Naomi...
Excuse me...
I'm sorry about earlier today.
No, it's our fault.
Please take these.
Thank you.
That was... the most beautiful she's ever been.
Thank you so much.
It's nothing.
Welcome.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ah!
Don't tell me...
Yes, she's my wife.
Wow!
Nice to meet you.
You've caught a pretty one!
It's not a big deal!
Take your time and warm up.
Yes, thank you.
Good evening.
Oh, hello.
Do you always come here?
I've been coming here for more than 50 years.
Oh!
Maybe I've seen you before...
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.
They use groundwater heated by firewood.
The water feels soft.
That's why it doesn't sting even though it's hot.
I see.
It's the best bath house in Japan!
Right.
See you again, Tsuyako.
Thank you, come again.
Would you like me to help?
It's bad karma to get help from the customer!
You do everything by yourself?
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.
My son who works at a government office tells me I should sell this place, so they can build a condo here... but my current customers would be in a fix.
As long as I'm still healthy...
Come on, you're still young.
Give him your support.
What?
Dai is too kind.
He keeps everything to himself.
When his parents split up too...
He never cried in front of his mother.
He cried when he was alone in the bath.
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.
He's like that sometimes.
Please be understanding.
Yes.
How's the water today?
Hmm... so-so.
Oh, shush!
That's great.
It looks good on you.
It's all white!
It's going to get cold starting tomorrow!
Give it to me.
Thanks.
Hey, wanna go for a drink?
Oh, right!
I know a nice bar.
Really?
Let's go!
(With dialect) "Let's go".
Let's go?
Let's go.
Let's go!
It's good!
It's been a long time since we've drunk together like this.
It's like a scene from an enka (traditional Japanese song).
Your mother listened to this kind of music?
They must all be my father's.
Oh, right.
It started out as your father's cafe.
I don't even want to think about him.
Actually, I don't even remember his face.
Don't you want to see him?
Nope.
But... if I did...
If you met him?
I'd knock him out.
It's my father's favorite.
I think... your mom loved your dad the whole time.
No way.
Otherwise she would've thrown out all the records.
She wouldn't have sorted them.
Yes?
I want you to go right away.
What?
Now?
Yes, someone hung himself in the Star Hotel by the station.
What about the boss?
He just left for another client.
Please go by yourself today.
Okay?
Okay.
Have a good day.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Morning.
Thanks for last night.
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.
I gave it everything I've got.
I see.
It's really cold today.
Yeah.
Here.
Thank you.
Bloodshot eyes!
Didn't get any sleep?
This job is mentally draining.
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?
Thanks for the tea.
A lot happened when I was young.
I couldn't stay over there...
Where?
Hokkaido.
None of my past jobs lasted.
I just happened to end up in a cafe in this town.
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage... and died all of a sudden!
Then, our boss came...
That was when I witnessed encoffining for the first time.
Made me think... when I die, I want this person to do it for me.
He's completely different from others.
That's how I ended up here.
Fate plays funny tricks on people.
Never know what'll happen.
You're right.
Tastes great.
Hey, Yamashita.
Is he a friend of yours?
Good afternoon!
Good afternoon!
You don't have to greet him.
Honey...
Go on.
I'll catch up.
There's a rumor going around.
About what?
It's none of my business, but find a proper job!
Let's go!
Come!
I'm home.
Mika?
Mika...
What's wrong?
...make sure the relatives cannot see the cotton stuffing taking place...
At times, we may need to stuff the anus as well.
Roll up the cotton like this, and... push in all the way inside the anus to prevent an outflow of body fluid.
What's this?
You looked through my desk without my permission?
That's not the issue.
I just happened to be a model for this...
I found out about your job too.
So... what?
Why didn't you tell me?
You would've been against it...
Of course!
Doing this kind of job... aren't you ashamed of it?
Why should I be?
Because I touch dead people every day?
I just want you to have a normal job.
What's normal?
Everyone dies.
I'll eventually die, and so will you.
Death itself is normal.
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.
Please.
I've never complained until now.
When you wanted to quit the cello... and when you said you wanted to come back to the countryside...
I followed you with a smile.
Of course, I was actually sad.
But... because I love you...
So please... just this once,
do what I ask.
And if I said no?
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?
I'm going back to my parent's home.
Come and get me after you quit your job.
Mika...
Don't touch me!
Filthy!
It's wrong.
Huh?
My daughter didn't look like this.
Her hair color is wrong... it's all wrong!
That's what she looks like!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong.
Redo it.
Yes.
Why are you saying this now?
This only happened... because you didn't raise her properly!
You don't have to say it like that.
What did you say?
You also never paid any attention to her.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You got her on the damn bike, and you ended up surviving!
Aren't you ashamed?
Stop.
Stop, stop.
It's you!
Leave.
It doesn't change the fact that it's your fault Miyuki died.
Can you make up for it?
Huh?
Can you take that guy's job for the rest of your life and make up for it?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss will be sad to hear that.
What?
He really liked you.
He did?
Yeah!
You're our first ever employee!
The interview was very simple despite that.
He always acts on his instincts!
He said he felt something in you.
But still...
Sorry, but please talk to him in person if you want to quit.
He's upstairs.
Excuse me.
Come on in.
Okay.
What have you been eating?
What?
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?
Yes...
Eat here.
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.
Let's eat.
What's this?
Blowfish milt.
It's best grilled, with salt.
That's my wife.
Passed away 9 years ago.
All married couples are eventually separated by a death, but it's tough being the one left behind.
I dressed her up, and sent her away.
My very first client.
I've been working in this business ever since.
This too...
This is a corpse too.
The living eat the living to live.
Right?
These plants are an exception.
You have to eat if you don't want to die.
If you're going to eat, might as well taste good.
Tasty, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah it is... sadly.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Will I really be able to make a living with this job?
Do you want to try?
Yes.
Slowly, lower from the head.
Tomeo...
Good bye.
Thank you.
We've been doing nothing but argue since Tomeo started dressing up like that...
I haven't looked straight into his face for a long time.
But... seeing him smile made me think... ah... he really is my child.
Even if he looks like a girl... he really is my child!
Thank you so much!
Tastes great!
Is it tasty?
...Sadly.
Did you bring the cello?
Really?
I want to hear!
I'll play a little bit.
It's my first time listening to a cello live.
You were in an orchestra too, right?
Yes, but it went out of business right away.
How long have you been playing?
Ever since I was in kindergarten.
Wow, for that long?
This is also a children's cello... my father forced me to learn to play this.
Your father had a fine taste.
He's the worst father ever.
He ran a small cafe, but he ran away with a waitress, never came back.
He really was the worst father ever.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Who knows, probably already dead.
Well, what should I play?
Let's see... something Christmassy.
Yeah.
Uh... will different religions bother you?
Don't worry.
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu... we handle all religions here.
Then, for the Holy Night...
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Thank you always for your business.
Yes, tomorrow.
The name of the deceased is...
I will now prepare her for her last journey.
Gently cover her toes...
Um...
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.
Okay.
Grandma,
bye-bye.
Thank you for everything, grandma.
...in the name of Jesus Christ...
Amen.
Boss has aged a lot!
Thank you, honey.
Mika!
You haven't been cleaning this place?
Occasionally.
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.
I cleaned twice.
That's not "occasionally".
You're a mess without me, as I thought.
I have something to report too.
What is it?
I'm pregnant.
Wow...
I'm going to be a father?
So please start getting your life together.
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.
I don't care about money.
Let's just live happily together.
Yes, hello?
What?
Now?
What?
!
Okay.
I'll be there right away.
You're going to work at a time like this?
Lady at the bath house... passed away.
She's my wife, Mika.
She collapsed while carrying firewood... and passed away.
She was working 'til the very end.
It'll be lonely around here, without this bath house.
Please wipe her face one by one, and bid her farewell one last time.
Mom...
Mother...
Shiori.
This is good-bye to your grandma.
Mother...
Thank you for everything.
This is where you work?
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.
Please allow me to close the 'window'.
Thank you... see you again.
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?
Thank you.
I guess people get a hunch about these things.
Last winter, the two of us had a little Christmas party.
I didn't expect her to celebrate it at this age.
But... she said she wanted to have one no matter what.
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles... and celebrated together.
Then, out of the blue... she asked me to help her with the firewood.
This must have been what she meant.
I'm good at burning things.
Working here for a long time makes me think... that death... is a gateway.
Death doesn't mean the end, but leaving the present, heading for the next stage.
Truly a gateway.
As a gatekeeper,
I've seen off many people.
"Have a nice trip, see you again", I would say...
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry.
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
What are you doing?
This is it!
Here.
What?
Stone-letter.
"Stone-letter"?
In the ancient times, before humans invented writing... they searched for the stone that resembled their feelings, and gave it to another person.
The person who received the stone, read the other person's feelings by the weight and texture.
For example, smooth texture symbolizing a peaceful mind, and rough texture symbolizing a concern for others.
Thank you!
What did you feel?
It's a secret.
That's a wonderful story.
Who did you hear it from?
My old man.
Does that mean... that big stone too?
Yes, I got it from my father.
I never knew.
"Let's give each other stone-letters every year", he said... yet that was the only time.
Such a lousy father!
Can you play every day for the unborn baby?
Sure.
What nice weather.
Good afternoon.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.
What...?
Is she no longer here?
No, uh... my mother-in-law passed away two years ago.
Really?
Oh...
Excuse me, can I see it?
You're not supposed to...
[ Kobayashi Hideki. ] [ Time of death: 7:30 of the 18th, ]
[ Please come and collect his body... ]
I'm back, sorry for taking so long.
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.
What?
Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.
Father passed away.
Whose?
Yours.
What do you mean?
... is what they told me when I called the Yurahama Fishing Association.
Our address was in his belongings.
But I don't even know him...
I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!
And the person he ran away with can take care of him.
It seems he was alone the whole time.
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.
Anyway, we're no longer legally related... tell them I can't sign the documents.
Thanks.
Dai...
Please go for him.
Don't worry about it.
Please, I'm begging you.
I... abandoned my son in Hokkaido.
He was 6 years old.
I fell in love with someone...
"Mommy, mommy"... he cried, but...
I shook off his small arm, and left home.
Your son...
Of course I want to see him, but...
I can't.
Why not?
Just go see him if you want to.
Do all parents who've abandoned their child act like that?
Then you're all too irresponsible!
Please, go for him.
Go and see his last appearance.
Dai...
Boss...
Hey...
Take one you like.
Go ahead.
He was already dead when I showed up this morning.
I was surprised.
I don't know where he came from, but he came to this town by himself.
He worked very hard at the port.
So I let him live in this shack.
I see...
He was a quiet man...
I'm glad someone from his family showed up.
People from the funeral home will be here soon.
Okay.
He's your father.
I'm ashamed to admit...
I don't recognize... his face.
That he looked like this...
It doesn't even ring a bell.
What was this man's life?
He lived for 70-odd years...
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.
He's here.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Can I take him now?
Let's just toss him in.
Yeah.
Um...
Yes?
May I?
No, we can do it.
Just give him a drink after we place him into the coffin.
Ready...
What are you doing?
My husband is... an encoffiner.
Father...
He's my father.
Father...

Winters didn't feel this cold... when I was a child.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Please, this way.
Coming in.
My condolences.
We are here to assist you with encoffining.
May I light up the incense?
Yes.
Thank you for coming.
Looks like she's still alive.
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.
How can you tell?
The body is undamaged.
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.
What a waste, she's beautiful.
Do you want to try?
Yes.
For the deceased's peaceful depar ture, I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.
Everyone, please see her off from up close.
I will now begin the cleansing.
It has the thing.
What thing?
The thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing...
Err...
May I have a word with you?
Yes, what is it?
After the cleansing, we apply makeup on the deceased...
We have different makeups for male and female...
Oh... please wait.
Yes.
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?
Men's or girl's?
Come on, which one?
If I gave bir th to a girl from the star t, this would've never happened... but thanks to someone's seed...
Girl's is fine then?
Yep.
Female's, please.
Yes.
Tomeo...
"Okuribito"
DEPARTURES
Not many in the audience again today.
Yeah, they should put more effor t into adver tising.
I know!
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.
My wife's a web designer.
I'll make her do it for free.
What do you think?
More impor tantly, are you going to be fine?
About what?
Next, the next.
Next what?
You spent so much money on that, gotta star t looking for the next one.
Good per formance again, everyone.
Good work everyone.
Although the seats were empty... I think your per formances were great.
Um... actually... today... the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki... has something to tell you, so please give him your attention.
You're... disbanded.
See ya.
I finally became an orchestra member.
But it became a past memory in a flash.
This cello is innocent.
Only because it was bought by a loser like me, it lost its job.
In many ways... this cello was too heavy for me.
Thank you very much.
Please cook it immediately.
Yes.
Good bye.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
She gave me an octopus.
I just happened to see our neighbor.
They just caught it this morning.
What's wrong?
Disbanded.
What is?
My orchestra.
I see...
You just have to find the next one.
There won't be a next one.
Someone with my skill level can only go so far... and there's the debt for this cello.
How much?
Don't worry, if it's just around $1 0,000... I can pay it back with my job.
$1 80,000.
$1 ... $1 80,000?
Pros all spend that much... it's relatively cheap.
Why did you hide it from me?
I knew you'd be against it.
Why didn't you tell me... about something so impor tant?
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner.
"All the cities around the world are our new homes.
Let's live together on a musical tour."
Those were the words of my marriage proposal.
But the reality is harsh.
No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.
What happened?
This octopus is alive!
You're right. lt's alive.
Hey, Dai... what should we do?
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I think I'll quit.
Quit what?
Cello.
What will you do then?
Go back to the countryside... in Yamagata.
I vote yes!
Huh?
You don't mind?
Well, the house your mom left you... we don't need to pay rent, right?
But you really don't mind?
Yes.
This is a wonder ful instrument.
I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life, but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.
As if I was suddenly released from being tied up.
What I believed to be my dream... was probably not my real dream.
The only thing my mother left me, when she died two years ago.
I've been told my father ran the cafe at first, but I have almost no recollection of it.
After he left home for another woman, my mother ran this small cafe, and raised me alone.
Meal's ready.
Okay.
I thought you would hate the countryside more.
No, it's kind of refreshing.
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.
Really?
Oh, maybe I'll star t a shop.
What will you sell?
This is it!
This, this one!
No age limit, high salary?
In addition, shor t actual working time?
As a full-time employee!
"NK Agent"?
What kind of company is that?
"A job that helps out journeys."
A travel agency?
Oh, maybe tour guide?
It says "no experience necessary".
I'll go ask for details.
Yeah.
This is it.
Excuse me.
is this "NK Agent"?
Yes... I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.
Oh, you're here for the inter view!
The boss will be back soon, sit here.
Yes, thank you.
I... was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.
Oh... lt's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.
Um... what does this company do?
What?
You came without knowing anything?
It said to help out with journeys...
Uh... that's not what you do?
Boss, he's here for the inter view.
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.
Oh, it's you.
You seem more energetic than on the phone.
Thank you.
See?
It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.
Yes.
I brought my resume just in case.
Okay, sit down.
Thank you.
Can you put in lots of hours here?
Huh?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
Eh?
What's your name again?
It's Kobayashi Daigo.
Order his business cards right away.
Got it.
W... wait...
We haven't discussed anything...
salaries and other things...
Oh, right.
Let's star t with one hand.
"One hand"?
$500?
$5000.
$5000?
!
Too little?
Not at all, I can get that much?
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.
No, wait, what kind of work will I?
Let's see...
As my assistant at first.
Exactly what?
To be exact... encoffining.
Encoffining?
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.
It's star ting to bloom!
Corpse as in dead people?
You ask funny questions.
No, uh, um...
The job posting said helping out journeys.
I assumed it was a travel agency...
Oh, this is a misprint.
Misprint?
Not "helping out journeys", it's...
"Helping out peaceful depar ture".
Depar ture?
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.
This is for today.
No, I can't...
Don't worry!
No... I'm back.
Welcome back.
Here.
Where did you get this?
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?
Yonezawa-beef?
The highest-grade sirloin.
Wow!
Was it expensive?
I got paid in advance.
You got the job?
Kind of, yes.
Great!
Let's celebrate today.
Sure.
So, what kind of job was it?
Tour guide after all?
Not really...
Sales?
What's the matter?
It wasn't a travel agency.
Oh?
What was it?
Ceremonial event-related...
Like a wedding hall?
Yeah.
They might make you play the cello again!
I'll make sukiyaki right away.
Okay.
This is great!
Looks tasty.
I don't think I'll come back that late.
Get going.
Bye.
Morning.
Hello.
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.
Your business cards are ready.
No misprints.
Are these that uncommon?
This is my first time seeing a real one.
First time?
Yes.
My grandparents passed away before I've grown up, and my mother passed away while I was abroad.
She was already in her grave when I got back.
What about your father?
He left home for another woman when I was 6.
Your mother must have been lonely.
But... I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before... can really do this job?
You'll get used to it!
To dead bodies?
Yeah.
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy... but change of season...
Do you need help?
...will be very busy for us.
Where does work come from?
Funeral homes.
Funeral homes?
Yes.
Encoffining... used to be done by family members.
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes, then companies like ours appeared.
In shor t, it's a super-niche industry.
It's pretty heavy.
There are many kinds of coffins.
$500, $1 000, $3000.
They differ by that much?
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and car vings on both sides.
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.
Yes, they all burn the same way.
Same ashes.
The last shopping of your life is done by others.
Kind of ironic.
Right.
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Yes, he's here.
Yes, Minato Theater?
Lmmediately?
Okay.
is that the boss?
A job.
A job?
Are you from NK?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, there he is.
He's a newcomer to our company...
Kobayashi.
...his name is Kobayashi, the model for today.
Good luck everyone.
Model?
We're going to film right after you finish changing.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Get changed and makeup over there.
Makeup?
Yes.
Boss...
Don't worry.
Go ahead.
Okay.
[Encoffining Manual] ...first apply cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Followed by...
The model is coming out!
Not bad.
Um... who's going to see this video?
Don't worry, it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.
In encoffining, we first per form cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust... and also symbolizes the first bath for a new bir th.
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing, but for sanitary reasons, nowadays, we use sterilized cloths... to wipe... the body.
Clothing ritual is per formed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives... we per form it with utmost care.
After the preparation, we shave the face before applying makeup.
Males in par ticular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin, it seems as if they have a long mustache, so we shave them thoroughly.
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.
Therefore, we per form it with caution and care...
Ow!
What the...
Ow, ow!
Uh, oh.
Ow, it hur ts, it hur ts!
Uh, oh...
Ow, ow!
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's not so bad.
Welcome home.
I'm home.
What is it?
What happened to your face?
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.
You were shaving at work?
Yeah.
You only use electric shavers at home... I had no choice, the boss ordered me to do it.
Don't worry, it's not so bad.
Weird company.
No kidding.
Weird... weird company.
The first job came without a warning.
Um... what should I do?
For today... you just have to watch.
Okay.
But man... we hit a bad one.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Well, you'll see.
Don't scare me like that!
Thank you for waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Where is the body?
An old lady living by herself... dead for two weeks.
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful.
See you later.
Who is he?
From the funeral home.
Our employer.
Let's get star ted.
It stinks!
Ugh.
This way.
Eh?
Help out a little.
Yes.
Hold her feet.
Her feet!
Yes.
You said I only have to watch...
Slowly... gently...
Come on, hold them!
Yes.
Wait, wait...
You can go home for today.
It was a bit too intense for the first job.
Really?
Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!
Hey, did you eat something weird?
No.
Something smells.
Must be your scar f!
No way!
That guy wearing black, he smells!
Ah!
It's still here!
Leave it over there.
Yes.
$3.
Okay.
Thanks.
Towels for $1 .
Okay.
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.
I refuse to quit.
Leave already.
I just want the best for you.
You talk just like a civil ser vant!
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!
Right?
Shiori?
Can I come for the big bath again?
Yes, of course!
For you, grandma will work hard!
Daigo...
Yamashita.
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!
Sorry, I've been busy.
Oh!
You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It sure has been!
I hear you have an amazing job!
Huh?
Well... yes...
What is that instrument called?
Cello, that monster-sized violin.
Right, cello!
He's a great man.
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
If only my son was as talented as he is!
Mom...
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...
Sure, next time.
Bring your wife here next time.
You're married, right?
Yes.
This place is very peaceful without this fool.
Which fool gave bir th to this fool?
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!
Oh, I got it!
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I finally figured it out.
Something happen at work?
No.
Let's eat!
Yeah.
Let's eat...
Our neighbor gave it to me.
Oh.
It was just slaughtered this morning, so it's really fresh!
She said we can even eat it raw!
Maybe we should wait a little longer.
Hey...
Are you ok?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dai, you're acting strange...
Hey, come on, Dai...
Hey, you're embarrassing me.
Not here...
Dai?
Hey, wait...
Mika...
Mika...
What exactly... am I being tested for?
is this my punishment for not seeing my mother off?
What will happen to me?
Strangely, thinking about it made me want to play the cello.
I simply wanted to play the cello while reminiscing my past.
It's so small...
Salmons?
Ah, yes.
They're right by the rocks... over there.
Oh!
Go for it!
It's kind of sad... to climb only to die.
Why work so hard if you're going to die anyway?
I'm sure they want to go back... to their bir thplace.
Let's go for lunch.
Lunch.
It's an order from your boss.
is this a coincidence?
Huh?
That you happened to pass through here.
It's fate.
There's no such thing...
This is your god-given job.
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.
They're angry!
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!
Sorry.
You're late.
It's 5 minutes past already!
I apologize.
You people make a living from the dead.
Brother...
Hurry up, damn it.
I sincerely apologize.
is there a lipstick your wife liked to use?
What?
To revive a cold body, and grant eternal beauty.
It was calm and precise.
And more than anything, it was filled with affection.
To be present at the last farewell, and send off the deceased.
It was tranquil, and every action seemed elegant.
Thank you very much.
Please allow me to close the lid.
Naomi...
Naomi...
Excuse me... I'm sorry about earlier today.
No, it's our fault.
Please take these.
Thank you.
That was... the most beautiful she's ever been.
Thank you so much.
It's nothing.
Welcome.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ah!
Don't tell me...
Yes, she's my wife.
Wow!
Nice to meet you.
You've caught a pretty one!
It's not a big deal!
Take your time and warm up.
Yes, thank you.
Good evening.
Oh, hello.
Do you always come here?
I've been coming here for more than 50 years.
Oh!
Maybe I've seen you before...
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.
They use groundwater heated by firewood.
The water feels soft.
That's why it doesn't sting even though it's hot.
I see.
It's the best bath house in Japan!
Right.
See you again, Tsuyako.
Thank you, come again.
Would you like me to help?
It's bad karma to get help from the customer!
You do everything by yourself?
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.
My son who works at a government office tells me I should sell this place so they can build a condo here... but my current customers would be in a fix.
As long as I'm still healthy...
Come on, you're still young.
Give him your suppor t.
What?
Dai is too kind.
He keeps everything to himself.
When his parents split up too...
He never cried in front of his mother.
He cried when he was alone in the bath.
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.
He's like that sometimes.
Please be understanding.
Yes.
How's the water today?
Hmm... so-so.
Oh, shush!
That's great. lt looks good on you.
It's all white!
It's going to get cold star ting tomorrow!
Give it to me.
Thanks.
Hey, wanna go for a drink?
Oh, right!
I know a nice bar.
Really?
Let's go!
(With dialect) "Let's go".
Let's go?
Let's go.
Let's go!
It's good!
It's been a long time since we've drunk together like this.
It's like a scene from an enka (traditional Japanese song).
Your mother listened to this kind of music?
They must all be my father's.
Oh, right.
It star ted out as your father's cafe.
I don't even want to think about him.
Actually, I don't even remember his face.
Don't you want to see him?
Nope.
But... if I did... lf you met him?
I'd knock him out.
It's my father's favorite.
I think... your mom loved your dad the whole time.
No way.
Other wise she would've thrown out all the records.
She wouldn't have sor ted them.
Yes?
I want you to go right away.
What?
Now?
To go right away.
Yes, someone hung himself in the Star Hotel by the station.
What about the boss?
He just left for another client.
Please go by yourself today.
Okay?
Okay.
Have a good day.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Morning.
Thanks for last night.
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.
I gave it everything I've got.
I see.
It's really cold today.
Yeah.
Here.
Thank you.
Bloodyshot eyes!
Didn't get any sleep?
This job is mentally draining.
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?
Thanks for the tea.
A lot happened when I was young.
I couldn't stay over there...
Where?
Hokkaido.
None of my past jobs lasted.
I just happened to end up in a cafe in this town.
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage... and died all of a sudden!
Then, our boss came...
That was when I witnessed encoffining for the first time.
Made me think... when I die, I want this person to do it for me.
He's completely different from others.
That's how I ended up here.
Fate plays funny tricks on people.
Never know what'll happen.
You're right.
Tastes great.
Hey, Yamashita.
is he a friend of yours?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You don't have to greet him.
Honey...
Go on. I'll catch up.
There's a rumor going around.
About what?
It's none of my business, but find a proper job!
Let's go.
Come.
I'm home.
Mika?
Mika...
What's wrong?
...make sure the relatives cannot see the cotton stuffing taking place...
At times, we may need to stuff the anus as well.
Roll up the cotton like this, and... push in all the way inside the anus to prevent an outflow of body fluid.
What's this?
You looked through my desk without my permission?
That's not the issue.
I just happened to be a model for this... I found out about your job too.
So... what?
Why didn't you tell me?
You would've been against it...
Of course!
Doing this kind of job... aren't you ashamed of it?
Why should I be?
Because I touch dead people everyday?
I just want you to have a normal job.
What's normal?
Everyone dies.
I'll eventually die, and so will you.
Death itself is normal.
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.
Please.
I've never complained until now.
When you wanted to quit the cello... and when you said you wanted to come back to the countryside... I followed you with a smile.
Of course, I was actually sad.
But... because I love you...
So please... just this once,
do what I ask.
And if I said no?
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?
I'm going back to my parent's home.
Come and get me after you quit your job.
Mika...
Don't touch me!
Filthy!
It's wrong.
Huh?
My daughter didn't look like this.
Her hair color is wrong... it's all wrong!
That's how she look like!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong.
Redo it.
Yes.
Why are you saying this now?
This only happened... because you didn't raise her properly!
You don't have to say it like that.
What did you say?
You also never paid any attention to her.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You got her on the damn bike, and you ended up sur viving!
Aren't you ashamed?
Stop.
Stop, stop.
It's you!
Leave.
It doesn't change the fact that it's your fault Miyuki died.
Can you make up for it?
Huh?
Can you take that guy's job for rest of your life and make up for it?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss will be sad to hear that.
What?
He really liked you.
He did?
Yeah!
You're our first ever employee!
The inter view was very simple despite that.
He always acts on his instincts!
He said he felt something in you.
But still...
Sorry, but please talk to him in person if you want to quit.
He's upstairs.
Excuse me.
Come on in.
Okay.
What have you been eating?
What?
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?
Yes...
Eat here.
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.
Let's eat.
What's this?
Blow fish milt.
It's best grilled, with salt.
That's my wife.
Passed away 9 years ago.
All married couples are eventually separated by a death, but it's tough being the one left behind.
I dressed her up, and sent her away.
My very first client.
I've been working in this business ever since.
This too...
This is a corpse too.
The living eat the living to live.
Right?
These plants are an exception.
You have to eat if you don't want to die.
If you're going to eat, might as well taste good.
Tasty, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah it is... sadly.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Will I really be able to make a living with this job?
Do you want to try?
Yes.
Slowly, lower from the head.
Tomeo...
Good bye.
Thank you.
We've been doing nothing but argue since Tomeo star ted dressing up like that... I haven't looked straight into his face for a long time.
But... seeing him smile made me think... ah... he really is my child.
Even if he looks like a girl... he really is my child!
Thank you so much!
Tastes great!
is it tasty?
...Sadly.
Did you bring the cello?
Really?
I want to hear!
I'll play a little bit.
It's my first time listening to a cello live.
You were in an orchestra too, right?
Yes, but it went out of business right away.
How long have you been playing?
Ever since I was in kindergar ten.
Wow, for that long?
This is also a children's cello... my father forced me to learn to play this.
Your father had a fine taste.
He's the worst father ever.
He ran a small cafe, but he ran away with a waitress, never came back.
He really was the worst father ever.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Who knows, probably already dead.
Well, what should I play?
Let's see... something Christmassy.
Yeah.
Uh... will different religions bother you?
Don't worry.
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu... we handle all religions here.
Then, for the Holy Night...
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Thank you always for your business.
Yes, tomorrow.
The name of the deceased is... I will now prepare for her last journey.
Gently cover her toes...
Um...
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.
Okay.
Grandma,
bye-bye.
Thank you for everything, grandma.
...in the name of Jesus Christ...
Amen.
Boss has aged a lot!
Thank you, honey.
Mika!
You haven't been cleaning this place?
Occasionally.
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.
I cleaned twice.
That's not "occasionally".
You're a mess without me, as I thought.
I have something to repor t too.
What is it?
I'm pregnant.
Wow... I'm going to be a father?
So please star t getting your life together.
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.
I don't care about money.
Let's just live happily together.
Yes, hello?
What?
Now?
What?
!
Okay. I'll be there right away.
You're going to work at a time like this?
Lady at the bath house... passed away.
She's my wife, Mika.
She collapsed while carrying firewood... and passed away.
She was working 'til the very end.
It'll be lonely around here, without this bath house.
Please wipe her face one by one, and bid her farewell one last time.
Mom...
Mother...
Shiori.
This is good-bye to your grandma.
Mother...
Thank you for everything.
This is where you work?
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.
Please allow me to close the 'window'.
Thank you... see you again.
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?
Thank you.
I guess people get a hunch about these things.
Last winter, the two of us had a little Christmas par ty.
I didn't expect her to celebrate it at this age.
But... she said she wanted to have one no matter what.
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles... and celebrated together.
Then, out of the blue... she asked me to help her with the firewood.
This must have been what she meant.
I'm good at burning things.
Working here for a long time makes me think... that death... is a gateway.
Death doesn't mean the end, but leaving the present, heading for the next stage.
Truly a gateway.
As a gatekeeper, I've seen off many people.
"Have a nice trip, see you again", I would say...
Mom... I'm sorry, mom... I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry.
Mom... I'm sorry, mom.
What are you doing?
This is it!
Here.
What?
Stone-letter.
"Stone-letter"?
In the ancient times, before humans invented writing... they searched for the stone that resembled their feelings, and gave it to another person.
The person who received the stone, read the other person's feelings by the weight and texture.
For example, smooth texture symbolizing a peaceful mind, and rough texture symbolizing a concern for others.
Thank you.
What did you feel?
It's a secret.
That's a wonder ful story.
Who did you hear it from?
My old man.
Does that mean... that big stone too?
Yes, I got it from my father.
I never knew.
"Let's give each other stone-letters every year", he said... yet that was the only time.
Such a lousy father!
Can you play everyday for the unborn baby?
Sure.
What a nice weather.
Good afternoon.
is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.
What?
is she no longer here?
No, uh... my mother-in-law passed away two years ago.
Really?
Oh...
Excuse me, can I see it?
You're not supposed to...
[Kobayashi Hideki.
Time of death: 7:30 of the 1 8th, please come and collect his body...] I'm back, sorry for taking so long.
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.
What?
Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.
Father passed away.
Whose?
Yours.
What do you mean?
...is what they told me when I called the Yurahama Fishing Association.
Our address was in his belongings.
But I don't even know him... I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!
And the person he ran away with can take care of him.
It seems he was alone the whole time.
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.
Anyway, we're no longer legally related... tell them I can't sign the documents.
Thanks.
Dai...
Please go for him.
Don't worry about it.
Please, I'm begging you.
I... abandoned my son in Hokkaido.
He was 6 years old.
I fell in love with someone...
"Mommy, mommy"... he cried, but... I shook off his small arm, and left home.
Your son...
Of course I want to see him, but...
I can't.
Why not?
Just go see him if you want to.
Do all parents who've abandoned their child act like that?
Then you're all too irresponsible!
Please, go for him.
Go and see his last appearance.
Dai... boss...
Hey...
Take one you like.
Go ahead.
He was already dead when I showed up this morning.
I was surprised.
I don't know where he came from, but he came to this town by himself.
He worked very hard at the por t.
So I let him live in this shack.
I see...
He was a quiet man... I'm glad someone from his family showed up.
People from the funeral home will be here soon.
Okay.
He's your father.
I'm ashamed to admit... I don't recognize... his face.
That he looked like this... lt doesn't even ring a bell.
What was this man's life?
He lived for 70-odd years...
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.
He's here.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Can I take him now?
Let's just toss him in.
Yeah.
Um...
Yes?
May I?
No, we can do it.
Just give him a drink after we place him into the coffin.
Ready...
What are you doing?
My husband is... an encoffiner.
Father...
He's my father.
Father...

When I was a child winter didn't feel so cold.
It's nearly two months since I moved home from Tokyo.
It's been an awkward time.
(In Mourning)
This way.
Excuse us.
Please accept our condolences.
We are here for the encoffinment.
May we offer incense?
Please do.
She looks alive.
Suicide by charcoal.
How do you know?
No agony.
And they probably found her right away.
Too bad... she's beautiful.
Want to do it?
All right.
The rite of encoffinment is to prepare the deceased for a peaceful departure.
Please come closer and watch.
I will now wipe the body.
She's got one.
Got what?
A thing.
What thing?
A 'thing'!
Excuse me...
Yes?
Once the departed is dressed, we will apply make-up.
We have make-up for women, or for men...
Oh... just a minute.
How'd you like Tomeo made up, Sis?
Boy, or girl?
What'll it be?
If I'd only had him as a girl at the first, none of this... would've happened.
Girl, then?
Yes.
As a girl, please.
Certainly.
Tomeo!
Departures
Another empty house.
We should advertise more.
I know!
An orchestra website.
My wife's a web designer.
She'd do it for free.
Forget that, Daigo.
Are you OK?
Huh?
Your next gig.
Next?
You'll need a job to pay off a cello like that.
Well done, everybody.
The audience was a little sparse, but you played wonderfully.
However, as it turns out... the owner of this orchestra, Mr Sonezaki, has a few words to say.
So if you would please give him your attention...
The orchestra is dissolved.
See you.
The orchestra job
I'd finally managed to land... in a flash was not history, only a memory.
It wasrt the cello's fault.
I shouldn't have bought it.
Now I'd lost my job.
In many ways that cello... had been too much for me.
Thank you!
Goodbye.
I'm home!
Hi.
I got an octopus.
From the neighbor.
Caught this morning.
What's the matter?
We're dissolved.
Who?
The orchestra.
Oh...
You'll find another one.
There won't be one.
I'm not good enough.
And I owe for that.
How much?
That's OK.
I'm working.
We can pay off a million yen.
18 million.
18 million yen!
That's what all the pros pay.
Maybe even more.
Why did you hide that?
I thought you'd say no.
But something that important...
why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry.
I'll make supper.
'The world's cities will be our home.
'Come tour with me.'
That's how I proposed.
But reality was harsh.
No.
I should have realized the limits to my talent.
What's wrong?
It's alive!
Yeah!
What should we do?
!
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I should quit.
What?
Cello.
And do what?
Go back up to Yamagata.
Agreed!
You don't mind?
We can live free in the house your mother left you.
It's really OK?
This was my great turning point... but in a strange way, selling the cello was a relief.
I felt freed from ties that had bound me for so long.
What I'd always taken as my dream maybe hadrt been one after all.
'Harmony'
This was all my mother had left me when she'd died two years before.
My father had run a coffee shop here... but I hardly remembered it.
After he deserted us... she ran it as a small bar... and raised me alone.
Supper's ready!
Coming!
I thought you'd hate it here.
No!
Everything's so new.
Rice tastes better.
Maybe it's the water.
Maybe I should open a shop...
What kind?
Hey!
This ad.
'No age restriction, good salary.
'Short working hours, full-time employee.'
'NK Agent'... what's that?
'Working with departures.' A travel agency, maybe.
A tour guide?
'No experience necessary.' I'll give them a call.
Here.
NK Agent
Hello?
Is this NK Agent?
Yes.
I'm Kobayashi.
I called earlier.
For the interview?
The boss'll be right back.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
I was against the boss putting an ad in the paper.
It's hard finding people for this.
What sort of company would this be?
You mean you don't know?
It said 'departures'...
No?
The mars here about the job.
Hello.
I phoned this morning.
Oh, you...
So you're not depressing...
Thank you.
I knew an ad would work.
Make some tea.
My resume...
Good.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Will you work hard?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
What's your name?
'Daigo Kobayashi'.
Get him some cards.
OK.
But what about salary and stuff like that?
Oh... how about one hand to start?
'One hand'?
50,000?
500.
500,000?
!
Too low?
You pay that much?
In cash, if you want.
What does the job involve?
Well...
At first, being my assistant, I guess.
Specifically...
'Specifically'?
Casketing.
'Casketing'?
Putting bodies in coffins.
It bloomed!
You mean 'dead bodies'?
That's really funny.
Uh, no, I mean...
The ad said 'departures', so I thought it meant... a travel agency.
That's a misprint.
It's not 'departures', it's... 'the departed'.
The departed?
!
'NK' stands for [nokan], 'casketing'.
Anyway, fate brought you here.
Give it a try.
Quit if you don't like it.
Today's pay.
No, I couldn't...
It's fine.
No, no...
I'm back.
Hi.
Here.
What's that?
You said you wanted sukiyaki.
Yonezawa beef?
!
Grade A.
That's expensive!
I got an advance.
You got the job?
Sort of.
So we're celebrating!
So what's the job?
A tour guide?
No...
Sales?
What?
It's not a travel agent.
So what is it?
Ceremonies.
Like weddings?
Maybe you can play cello for them.
I'll get the sukiyaki ready.
OK.
I won't be too late.
'Bye.
'Morning.
Here I am.
Use the boss's desk till yours comes.
Your business cards are done.
No misprints.
They're just coffins.
They're the first I've seen.
The first?
My grandparents died before I can remember.
I was abroad when my mom died, so I missed her funeral.
And your dad?
He left us when I was six.
That must have been hard for your mom.
Can someone who's never seen a corpse actually do this job?
You'll get used to it.
To corpses?
It's slow now in the summer, but when the seasons change...
I'll help.
...it's one job after another.
Who hires us?
Undertakers.
Undertakers?
It used to be that families prepared the bodies.
Then undertakers took it on... and places like ours started up.
It's a niche market.
They're heavy.
There's different types.
50,000.
100,000.
300,000.
They're that different?
That's plywood, this one has gold fittings and carved sides.
And this one's pure hinoki cypress.
So it's the wood and the fittings...
Yep.
They burn the same way, into the same ashes.
Your last purchase, and someone else chooses it.
It's ironic.
NK Agent...
Yes, he's here.
The Minatoza?
He'll be right there.
The boss?
A job.
A job?
(Minatoza Theater)
NK Agent?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, good.
This is my new assistant, uh...
'Kobayashi'.
Kobayashi.
He'll be our model today.
Model?
We'll start shooting as soon as you get changed.
Costume and make-up's over here.
Make-up?
Sir...
It's fine.
Let's start.
(Casketing Procedure)
The model's ready!
Good.
Where will this be shown?
It's fine.
It's just for the trade.
No one'll see it.
The first step in casketing is washing of the body.
This washes away the weariness, pain, and cares of this world... and represents the first bath for one newborn in the next.
In olden times, a wash-cloth was used for this, but now, for reasons of hygiene, a sterilized cloth is used
to wipe... the body.
To preserve dignity, take great care that family members do not see the bare skin of the deceased.
Once the body is dressed, the face is shaved before make-up is applied.
Especially with men, facial hair will be more apparent due to tissue contraction and drying of the skin so great care must be taken.
Necrotic skin is extremely fragile.
Even the pressure of a finger can break it.
For this reason, we must proceed... with very great care...
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
He's bleeding!
Ow!
It's fine.
It's just a scratch.
Hi.
What?
Your face...
The boss wanted me shaved.
You shaved at work?
But you only ever use an electric razor.
The boss said to.
It's just a scratch.
That's weird.
Yeah, it's a weird place.
Suddenly, my first case.
What should I do?
Today... just watch.
All right.
But it's one of those.
You picked a bad one.
What do you mean?
You'll see.
Don't scare me!
Here we are.
Ah, good.
Where's the body?
Old lady, lived alone.
Dead two weeks.
She's in pretty bad shape.
See you later.
Who's that?
The undertaker.
Our employer.
Let's get to work.
It stinks!
Come on.
Give me a hand.
Get her legs.
Her legs!
Right.
You said just to watch.
Gently, gently...
Hold her tighter!
Take the day off.
That was a bit much for your first job.
Did you eat something weird?
No.
Something stinks.
Your scarf!
It does not!
No?
- Hey...
- What?
That guy in the suit...
Next stop, Minami-Ginza.
(Tsurunoyu Public Bath)
It's still here!
Just leave it there.
300 yen.
Thanks.
Towel's 100 yen.
You'll get a good price now!
I'm not quitting!
Go away!
It's for your own good, Ma!
Get back to your city hall.
I'm not that old yet.
Am I, Shiori?
Can I come again for the big bath?
Of course!
I'll keep this bath-house going just for you!
Daigo?
Yamashita...
Why didn't you tell me you're back?
Sorry.
It's been a bit crazy.
Well!
If it's not the Kobayashi boy Daigo!
It's been a while.
That it has!
That's quite the job you found yourself!
Huh?
Uh, yeah...
What's that thing he plays?
The cello.
A great big violin.
That's it, a cello!
That gentlemars really something.
He plays the cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
I wish my son had talent!
Ma!
This isn't a good time.
We'll have a drink.
OK.
Bring the wife along.
You're married, aren't you?
Yes.
When this fool's not here.
And who gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I'm not selling!
There!
Mate?
Mate.
I win.
Anything wrong?
Let's eat.
Mrs Fujii next door gave us this.
Fresh-killed this morning.
You could eat it raw.
Not quite yet...
Are you OK?
Are you OK?
What?
What's the matter?
What's wrong with you?
Hey!
No, Daigo, don't!
Not here!
Daigo?
Hey...
Mika!
Was this a trial I was being put through for not looking after my mother?
Where was I going?
I suddenly wanted to play the cello.
I just wanted to play the cello and let memory rewind.
It's tiny!
Salmon?
Oh... yes.
There, by those rocks.
Go!
Go!
Sad, isn't it.
Coming all this way just to die.
It doesn't seem won'th it.
They want to come home.
Back to where they were born.
Let's go eat.
The boss says to.
Why... did you take this road?
Fate.
Yeah, right!
You were born to do this.
That's fine for you to say!
I'm very, very sorry!
He's mad!
Mr Sasaki, please!
I'm sorry.
You're late!
Five minutes late!
I'm very sorry.
You make your living on the dead.
Stop it!
Move it!
I apologize.
May I have your wife's favorite lipstick?
Huh?
One grown cold, restored to beauty for all eternity.
This was done with a calmness, a precision and above all, a gentle affection.
At the final parting, sending the dead on their way everything done peacefully, and beautifully.
Thank you.
I will now affix the lid.
Naomi!
Naomi...
Naomi!
Excuse me!
I'm sorry about what I said.
No.
We were late.
Please have this.
Thank you.
She'd... never looked so beautiful.
Thank you very much.
Nothing.
Come in.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Don't tell me...
Yes.
My wife.
How do you do.
Isn't she a dear!
You're too kind.
Go into the bath and get warm.
Thank you.
'Evening.
Oh, hello.
You always come here?
For 50 years.
I see... well...
It's nice the water's so hot.
She pumps up groundwater and heats it with wood.
That softens it.
It's hot, but it doesn't make you itch.
I see...
Best in the land!
Good night, Tsuyako.
Thank you.
Shall I help you?
It's bad luck to put a customer to work.
You do it all yourself?
Yes, for years.
Since I lost my husband.
My civil-servant son wants me to sell the place for condominiums.
But what would my customers do?
So while I'm still healthy...
You still have a long time.
Look after him.
Daigo's a dear boy.
He takes it all on himself.
When his folks split up, he'd never cry in front of his mom.
But he would when he was alone in that bath.
The poor little thing, his shoulders shaking...
So that's how he is.
Please understand him.
I will.
How was the water?
So-so.
The kerchief suits you.
It's all white!
The cold's set in.
Here.
Thanks.
Let's have a drink.
I know a fine place.
Let's go!
Let's be off.
OK?
OK.
We're off!
That's good!
We haven't done this in ages.
It's like an old song.
Your mom liked this?
They were all dad's.
Right, this was your dad's coffee shop...
Don't remind me.
I don't even remember his face.
Would you like to see him?
No.
But if I did...
If you did...
I'd hit him.
Dad liked this piece.
I bet... your mom stayed in love with your dad.
No.
Then she'd have thrown his records out.
Not kept them so nice.
Go ahead.
Right now.
Right now?
Someone hanged himself in a hotel.
Where's the boss?
He just left on another call.
Can you handle it alone?
All right.
Off you go.
See you.
Good morning.
Good job last night.
The police were impressed.
'He's so young,' they said.
It was all a blur.
Oh?
Isn't it cold!
Here.
Thank you.
Your eyes are red.
Didrt you sleep?
The job grows on you, doesn't it.
How did you get into this business?
Thanks.
Things happened when I was young.
I had to leave my home town.
Obihiro.
I had a bunch of jobs and ended up in a little bar here.
But the owner... took a stroke and died.
Then the boss came.
I'd never seen casketing before.
I thought if I died,
I'd want him to put me in my coffin.
There's no one quite like him, is there.
So here I am.
It's funny how fate works.
You never know where you'll end up.
That's right.
This tea's good.
Hi, Yamashita.
A friend?
Hello!
Ignore him.
Stop it!
Go on ahead.
People are talking.
About what?
Get yourself a proper job!
Let's go.
I'm home.
Huh?
Mika?
Mika?
What's wrong?
This is done in such a way that the family does not see.
The anus must sometimes be blocked.
The cotton wool is rolled and pressed deep into the anus.
This prevents seepage.
What's all that?
You looked in my desk...
Don't change the subject.
I just got this acting job...
I checked what the company does.
So?
Why didn't you say?
You'd say no.
Of course!
Arert you ashamed having a job like that?
What's to be ashamed of?
Touching dead people?
Just get a normal job.
'Normal'?
Everyone dies.
I'll die, and so will you.
Death is normal.
Spare me the word games!
I want you to quit.
Please.
I haven't said anything so far, have I.
When you wanted to quit the cello and move back up here...
I just smiled.
The fact is, I was all broken up over it.
But...
I love you.
So... just this once... listen to me.
And if I don't?
Will this be a career?
I'm going home.
Come see me when you quit.
Mika!
Don't touch me!
You're unclean!
No.
I'm sorry?
That's not my daughter.
The color's wrong.
It's all wrong!
That's Miyuki!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong!
Do it again.
Certainly.
What's the point now?
You didn't raise her right.
That's why this happened!
Don't talk like that.
What?
!
You didn't pay her much attention, either.
Who are you to talk?
!
You killed her on your bike!
Have you no shame?
!
Stop it!
Stop it!
All of you!
Get out.
It's your fault Miyuki's dead.
Can you make up for that?
Well?
Work all your lives like him at a job no one else would do?
Well?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss'll be disappointed.
He likes you.
He does?
Yes!
You're the first one he's ever made full-time!
He sure hired me fast enough...
The man goes on instinct.
He knew as soon as he saw you.
Even still...
Well, if you're going to quit, can you tell him yourself?
He's upstairs.
Excuse me...
Come in.
Are you eating?
Your wife's still away...
Yes.
Eat.
I'm probably a better cook than you.
Dig in.
What's that?
Puffer roe, grilled with salt.
It's good.
My wife.
She died on me nine years ago.
One of you always goes first, but it's hard being left behind.
I made her beautiful and sent her off.
She was my first.
Then I started this business.
Even this... is a corpse.
The living eat the dead.
Unless they're plants.
Unless you want to die, you eat.
And if you eat, eat well.
Good, huh?
Yes, it is.
So good I hate myself.
It's nearly two months since I moved home from Tokyo.
It's been an awkward time.
Can I really do this job?
Want to do it?
All right.
Lay the head down first, please.
Tomeo!
We'll take our leave.
Thank you.
Once he went like he did, we did nothing but fight.
After that I wasrt seeing him.
But when I saw his smile, I remembered.
'He's my son.
'He may dress as a girl, but he's still my son.'
Thank you very much!
Mmm!
Is it good?
I hate myself.
You brought your cello?
I want to hear it!
Just a bit.
I've never heard one live.
You were in an orchestra?
But it went broke.
When did you start playing?
In kindergarten.
That long ago?
This is a child's instrument.
My dad made me take lessons.
Good for him!
He was a louse.
He had a coffee shop, and he took off with a waitress.
A real bastard.
Where is he now?
Dead, probably.
So... what'll it be?
Well, since it's Christmas...
No problems of religious affiliation?
It's fine.
Buddhist, Christians, Islam, Hindu, we handle anything.
All right, for a holy night...
Hello, NK Agent.
Thank you for calling.
Tomorrow?
And the name of the deceased?
We will now prepare the deceased for her departure.
Slip them over the toes...
Um...
Grandma wanted to wear socks like ours.
Certainly.
Grandma... bye-bye.
Thank you for everything.
...we pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
He's getting old.
Papa...
Thank you!
Mika!
Don't you ever clean?
Sometimes.
Not even once.
Twice.
That's not 'sometimes'.
I guess you need me.
And I've got news.
What?
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to be a father?
So get yourself together, OK?
Will you be able to tell a child what you do?
The other kids will laugh.
I don't care about the money.
Let's be happy.
Hello?
Hi.
Right now?
What?
I'll be right there.
Are you going to work now?
The lady who runs the bath...
she's dead.
My wife Mika.
She was carrying firewood.
She dropped dead.
Working right till the end...
The town won't be the same without this bath.
If you would all wipe her face, and take your farewells.
Ma!
Mother!
Shiori...
Grandma's leaving us.
Mother!
Thank you for everything.
You work here?
If you would place your hands together...
I will now close the casket.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
May I watch?
Thank you.
People probably have a premonition of what's coming.
Last year we did Christmas Eve together.
Just like a young couple, at our age!
But she insisted... so we bought a little cake, and lit some candles and celebrated together.
Then all of a sudden she asks me to help her heat the public bath.
Now I know why.
I'm good at fire.
Working here all these years,
I've often thought that maybe death is like a gateway.
Dying doesn't mean the end.
You go through it and onto the next thing.
It's a gate.
And as the gatekeeper
I've sent so many on their way.
Telling them...
'Off you go.
'We'll meet again.'
Ma!
Ma!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Ma!
I'm sorry!
What are you doing?
This one.
Here.
What?
A stone letter.
'Stone letter'?
Long ago, before writing, you'd send someone a stone... that suited the way you were feeling.
From its weight and touch, they'd know how you felt.
From a smooth stone they might get that you were happy or from a rough one that you were worried about them.
Thank you.
What did you feel?
Not telling.
That's a lovely story.
Who told you?
My dad.
You mean... that big rock?
Yep.
I got it from him.
I didn't know that.
He said he'd send me one every year, but that's all I ever got.
That jerk!
Will you play for the baby every day till it's born?
What a nice day!
Hello.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
'Kazuko Kobayashi'?
Doesrt she live here?
My mother-in-law died two years ago.
What?
!
Is that so?
May I see that?
No, don't...
(Name of Deceased Kobayashi, Hideki)
I'm back.
You forgot your cell phone.
Huh?
It's at home... sorry.
Your father's dead.
Mine?
Yes.
What do you mean?
So I called the fishing port.
Our address was in his things.
But who cares now?
I haven't seen him in 30 years.
His girlfriend can tend to him.
They said he was single.
They're cremating him tomorrow.
His body's at the Fishermers Co-op there.
He's not on our family register.
Tell them I can't sign for him.
Daigo!
Go.
No, it's fine.
Please!
I left... a son in Obihiro.
He was six.
I met someone.
'Mommy!
Mommy!
' My son was crying.
I pushed his little hands away and went running out.
And since then?
I'd love to see him, but I can't.
Why not?
You could go there.
Are parents who dump their kids... always like that?
!
Please!
You have to see him this one last time.
Daigo...
Sir...
Wait.
Take one.
It's fine.
I came in and he was dead.
It was a real shock.
He just turned up in town one day, all alone.
He worked so hard helping out at the harbor... that we let him live in the watchmars cottage.
I see...
He was real quiet, hardly said a word.
I'm glad someone from his family came.
The undertaker's on his way.
So that's your father...
I hate to say it but I don't remember... his face.
I wouldn't know him to see him.
(Hideki Kobayashi)
So what was his life for, anyway?
Living 70-some years and leaving one box of stuff?
In here.
All right?
'Scuse us.
Excuse us.
Can we get started?
Let's get him loaded.
Um...
Yes?
Could I do that?
No, no, we'll do it.
Offer him some water when we get him in.
One, two...
What the...?
!
My husband is a professional.
Dad...
Father...

Winters didn't feel this cold... when I was a child.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Please, this way.
Coming in.
My condolences.
We are here to assist you with encoffining.
May I light up the incense?
Yes.
Thank you for coming.
Looks like she's still alive.
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.
How can you tell?
The body is undamaged.
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.
What a waste, she's beautiful.
Do you want to try?
Yes.
For the deceased's peaceful departure,
I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.
Everyone, please see her off from up close.
I will now begin the cleansing.
It has the thing.
What thing?
The thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing...
Err...
May I have a word with you?
Yes, what is it?
After the cleansing, we apply makeup on the deceased...
We have different makeups for male and female...
Oh... please wait.
Yes.
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?
Men's or girl's?
Come on, which one?
If I gave birth to a girl from the start, this would've never happened...
But thanks to someone's seed...
Girl's is fine then?
Yep.
Female's, please.
Yes.
Tomeo...
"Okuribito"
DEPARTURES
Not many in the audience again today.
Yeah, they should put more effort into advertising.
I know!
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.
My wife's a web designer.
I'll make her do it for free.
What do you think?
More importantly, are you going to be fine?
About what?
Next, the next.
Next what?
You spent so much money on that, gotta start looking for the next one.
Good performance again, everyone.
Good work everyone.
Although the seats were empty...
I think your performances were great.
Um... actually... today... the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki... has something to tell you, so please give him your attention.
You're... disbanded.
See ya.
I finally became an orchestra member.
But it became a past memory in a flash.
This cello is innocent.
Only because it was bought by a loser like me, it lost its job.
In many ways... this cello was too heavy for me.
Thank you very much.
Please cook it immediately.
Yes.
Good bye.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
She gave me an octopus.
I just happened to see our neighbor.
They just caught it this morning.
What's wrong?
Disbanded.
What is?
My orchestra.
I see...
You just have to find the next one.
There won't be a next one.
Someone with my skill level can only go so far... and there's the debt for this cello.
How much?
Don't worry, if it's just around $10,000...
I can pay it back with my job.
$180,000.
$1... $180,000?
Pros all spend that much... it's relatively cheap.
Why did you hide it from me?
I knew you'd be against it.
Why didn't you tell me... about something so important?
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner.
"All the cities around the world are our new homes.
Let's live together on a musical tour."
Those were the words of my marriage proposal.
But the reality is harsh.
No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.
What happened?
This octopus is alive!
You're right.
It's alive.
Hey, Dai... what should we do?
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I think I'll quit.
Quit what?
Cello.
What will you do then?
Go back to the countryside... in Yamagata.
I vote yes!
Huh?
You don't mind?
Well, the house your mom left you... we don't need to pay rent, right?
But you really don't mind?
Yes.
This is a wonderful instrument.
I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life, but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.
As if I was suddenly released from being tied up.
What I believed to be my dream... was probably not my real dream.
The only thing my mother left me, when she died two years ago.
I've been told my father ran the cafe at first, but I have almost no recollection of it.
After he left home for another woman, my mother ran this small cafe, and raised me alone.
Meal's ready.
Okay.
I thought you would hate the countryside more.
No, it's kind of refreshing.
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.
Really?
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.
What will you sell?
This is it!
This, this one!
No age limit, high salary?
In addition, short actual working time?
As a full-time employee!
"NK Agent"?
What kind of company is that?
"A job that helps out journeys."
A travel agency?
Oh, maybe tour guide?
It says "no experience necessary".
I'll go ask for details.
Yeah.
This is it.
Excuse me.
Is this "NK Agent"?
Yes...
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.
Oh, you're here for the interview!
The boss will be back soon, sit here.
Yes, thank you.
I... was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.
Oh...
It's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.
Um... what does this company do?
What?
You came without knowing anything?
It said to help out with journeys...
Uh... that's not what you do?
Boss, he's here for the interview.
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.
Oh, it's you.
You seem more energetic than on the phone.
Thank you.
See?
It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.
Yes.
I brought my resume just in case.
Okay, sit down.
Thank you.
Can you put in lots of hours here?
Huh?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
Eh?
What's your name again?
It's Kobayashi Daigo.
Order his business cards right away.
Got it.
W... wait...
We haven't discussed anything... salaries and other things...
Oh, right.
Let's start with one hand.
"One hand"?
$500?
$5000.
$5000?
!
Too little?
Not at all, I can get that much?
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?
Let's see...
As my assistant at first.
Exactly what...?
To be exact... encoffining.
Encoffining?
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.
It's starting to bloom!
Corpse as in dead people?
You ask funny questions.
No, uh, um...
The job posting said helping out journeys.
I assumed it was a travel agency...
Oh, this is a misprint.
Misprint?
Not "helping out journeys", it's...
"Helping out peaceful departure".
Departure?
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.
This is for today.
No, I can't...
Don't worry!
No...
I'm back.
Welcome back.
Here.
Where did you get this?
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?
Yonezawa-beef?
The highest-grade sirloin.
Wow!
Was it expensive?
I got paid in advance.
You got the job?
Kind of, yes.
Great!
Let's celebrate today.
Sure.
So, what kind of job was it?
Tour guide after all?
Not really...
Sales?
What's the matter?
It wasn't a travel agency.
Oh?
What was it?
Ceremonial event-related...
Like a wedding hall?
Yeah.
They might make you play the cello again!
I'll make sukiyaki right away.
Okay.
This is great!
Looks tasty.
I don't think I'll come back that late.
Get going.
Bye.
Morning.
Hello.
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.
Your business cards are ready.
No misprints.
Are these that uncommon?
This is my first time seeing a real one.
First time?
Yes.
My grandparents passed away before I've grown up, and my mother passed away while I was abroad.
She was already in her grave when I got back.
What about your father?
He left home for another woman when I was 6.
Your mother must have been lonely.
But...
I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before... can really do this job?
You'll get used to it!
To dead bodies?
Yeah.
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy... but change of season...
Do you need help?
...will be very busy for us.
Where does work come from?
Funeral homes.
Funeral homes?
Yes.
Encoffining... used to be done by family members.
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes, then companies like ours appeared.
In short, it's a super-niche industry.
It's pretty heavy.
There are many kinds of coffins.
$500, $1000, $3000.
They differ by that much?
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and carvings on both sides.
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.
Yes, they all burn the same way.
Same ashes.
The last shopping of your life is done by others.
Kind of ironic.
Right.
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Yes, he's here.
Yes, Minato Theater?
Immediately?
Okay.
Is that the boss?
A job.
A job?
Are you from NK?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, there he is.
He's a newcomer to our company...
Kobayashi.
...his name is Kobayashi, the model for today.
Good luck everyone.
Model?
We're going to film right after you finish changing.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Get changed and makeup over there.
Makeup?
Yes.
Boss...
Don't worry.
Go ahead.
Okay.
[ Encoffining Manual ] ...first apply cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Followed by...
The model is coming out!
Not bad.
Um... who's going to see this video?
Don't worry, it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.
In encoffining, we first perform cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust... and also symbolizes the first bath for a new birth.
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing, but for sanitary reasons, nowadays, we use sterilized cloths... to wipe... the body.
Clothing ritual is performed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives... we perform it with utmost care.
After the preparation, we shave the face before applying makeup.
Males in particular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin, it seems as if they have a long mustache, so we shave them thoroughly.
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.
Therefore, we perform it with caution and care...
Ow!
What the...
Ow, ow!
Uh, oh.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!
Uh, oh...
Ow, ow!
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's not so bad.
Welcome home.
I'm home.
What is it?
What happened to your face?
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.
You were shaving at work?
Yeah.
You only use electric shavers at home...
I had no choice, the boss ordered me to do it.
Don't worry, it's not so bad.
Weird company.
No kidding.
Weird... weird company.
The first job came without a warning.
Um... what should I do?
For today... you just have to watch.
Okay.
But man... we hit a bad one.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Well, you'll see.
Don't scare me like that!
Thank you for waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Where is the body?
An old lady living by herself... dead for two weeks.
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful.
See you later.
Who is he?
From the funeral home.
Our employer.
Let's get started.
It stinks!
Ugh.
This way.
Eh?
Help out a little.
Yes.
Hold her feet.
Her feet!
Yes.
You said I only have to watch...
Slowly... gently...
Come on, hold them!
Yes.
Wait, wait...
You can go home for today.
It was a bit too intense for the first job.
Really?
Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!
Hey, did you eat something weird?
No.
Something smells.
Must be your scarf!
No way!
That guy wearing black, he smells!
Ah!
It's still here!
Leave it over there.
Yes.
$3.
Okay.
Thanks.
Towels for $1.
Okay.
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.
I refuse to quit.
Leave already.
I just want the best for you.
You talk just like a civil servant!
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!
Right?
Shiori?
Can I come for the big bath again?
Yes, of course!
For you, grandma will work hard!
Daigo...
Yamashita.
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!
Sorry, I've been busy.
Oh!
You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It sure has been!
I hear you have an amazing job!
Huh?
Well... yes...
What is that instrument called?
Cello, that monster-sized violin.
Right, cello!
He's a great man.
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
If only my son was as talented as he is!
Mom...
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...
Sure, next time.
Bring your wife here next time.
You're married, right?
Yes.
This place is very peaceful without this fool.
Which fool gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!
Oh, I got it!
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I finally figured it out.
Something happen at work?
No.
Let's eat!
Yeah.
Let's eat...
Our neighbor gave it to me.
Oh.
It was just slaughtered this morning, so it's really fresh!
She said we can even eat it raw!
Maybe we should wait a little longer.
Hey...
Are you ok?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dai, you're acting strange...
Hey, come on, Dai...
Hey, you're embarrassing me.
Not here...
Dai?
Hey, wait...
Mika...
Mika...
What exactly... am I being tested for?
Is this my punishment for not seeing my mother off?
What will happen to me?
Strangely, thinking about it made me want to play the cello.
I simply wanted to play the cello while reminiscing my past.
It's so small...
Salmons?
Ah, yes.
They're right by the rocks... over there.
Oh!
Go for it!
It's kind of sad... to climb only to die.
Why work so hard if you're going to die anyway?
I'm sure they want to go back... to their birthplace.
Let's go for lunch.
Lunch.
It's an order from your boss.
Is this a coincidence?
Huh?
That you happened to pass through here.
It's fate.
There's no such thing...
This is your god-given job.
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.
They're angry!
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!
Sorry.
You're late.
It's 5 minutes past already!
I apologize.
You people make a living from the dead.
Brother...
Hurry up, damn it.
I sincerely apologize.
Is there a lipstick your wife liked to use?
What?
To revive a cold body, and grant eternal beauty.
It was calm and precise.
And more than anything, it was filled with affection.
To be present at the last farewell, and send off the deceased.
It was tranquil, and every action seemed elegant.
Thank you very much.
Please allow me to close the lid.
Naomi...
Naomi...
Excuse me...
I'm sorry about earlier today.
No, it's our fault.
Please take these.
Thank you.
That was... the most beautiful she's ever been.
Thank you so much.
It's nothing.
Welcome.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ah!
Don't tell me...
Yes, she's my wife.
Wow!
Nice to meet you.
You've caught a pretty one!
It's not a big deal!
Take your time and warm up.
Yes, thank you.
Good evening.
Oh, hello.
Do you always come here?
I've been coming here for more than 50 years.
Oh!
Maybe I've seen you before...
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.
They use groundwater heated by firewood.
The water feels soft.
That's why it doesn't sting even though it's hot.
I see.
It's the best bath house in Japan!
Right.
See you again, Tsuyako.
Thank you, come again.
Would you like me to help?
It's bad karma to get help from the customer!
You do everything by yourself?
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.
My son who works at a government office tells me I should sell this place so they can build a condo here... but my current customers would be in a fix.
As long as I'm still healthy...
Come on, you're still young.
Give him your support.
What?
Dai is too kind.
He keeps everything to himself.
When his parents split up too...
He never cried in front of his mother.
He cried when he was alone in the bath.
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.
He's like that sometimes.
Please be understanding.
Yes.
How's the water today?
Hmm... so-so.
Oh, shush!
That's great.
It looks good on you.
It's all white!
It's going to get cold starting tomorrow!
Give it to me.
Thanks.
Hey, wanna go for a drink?
Oh, right!
I know a nice bar.
Really?
Let's go!
(With dialect) "Let's go".
Let's go?
Let's go.
Let's go!
It's good!
It's been a long time since we've drunk together like this.
It's like a scene from an enka (traditional Japanese song).
Your mother listened to this kind of music?
They must all be my father's.
Oh, right.
It started out as your father's cafe.
I don't even want to think about him.
Actually, I don't even remember his face.
Don't you want to see him?
Nope.
But... if I did...
If you met him?
I'd knock him out.
It's my father's favorite.
I think... your mom loved your dad the whole time.
No way.
Otherwise she would've thrown out all the records.
She wouldn't have sorted them.
Yes?
I want you to go right away.
What?
Now?
Yes, someone hung himself in the Star Hotel by the station.
What about the boss?
He just left for another client.
Please go by yourself today.
Okay?
Okay.
Have a good day.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Morning.
Thanks for last night.
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.
I gave it everything I've got.
I see.
It's really cold today.
Yeah.
Here.
Thank you.
Bloodyshot eyes!
Didn't get any sleep?
This job is mentally draining.
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?
Thanks for the tea.
A lot happened when I was young.
I couldn't stay over there...
Where?
Hokkaido.
None of my past jobs lasted.
I just happened to end up in a cafe in this town.
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage... and died all of a sudden!
Then, our boss came...
That was when I witnessed encoffining for the first time.
Made me think... when I die, I want this person to do it for me.
He's completely different from others.
That's how I ended up here.
Fate plays funny tricks on people.
Never know what'll happen.
You're right.
Tastes great.
Hey, Yamashita.
Is he a friend of yours?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You don't have to greet him.
Honey...
Go on.
I'll catch up.
There's a rumor going around.
About what?
It's none of my business, but find a proper job!
Let's go.
Come.
I'm home.
Mika?
Mika...
What's wrong?
...make sure the relatives cannot see the cotton stuffing taking place...
At times, we may need to stuff the anus as well.
Roll up the cotton like this, and... push in all the way inside the anus to prevent an outflow of body fluid.
What's this?
You looked through my desk without my permission?
That's not the issue.
I just happened to be a model for this...
I found out about your job too.
So... what?
Why didn't you tell me?
You would've been against it...
Of course!
Doing this kind of job... aren't you ashamed of it?
Why should I be?
Because I touch dead people everyday?
I just want you to have a normal job.
What's normal?
Everyone dies.
I'll eventually die, and so will you.
Death itself is normal.
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.
Please.
I've never complained until now.
When you wanted to quit the cello... and when you said you wanted to come back to the countryside...
I followed you with a smile.
Of course, I was actually sad.
But... because I love you...
So please... just this once,
do what I ask.
And if I said no?
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?
I'm going back to my parent's home.
Come and get me after you quit your job.
Mika...
Don't touch me!
Filthy!
It's wrong.
Huh?
My daughter didn't look like this.
Her hair color is wrong... it's all wrong!
That's how she look like!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong.
Redo it.
Yes.
Why are you saying this now?
This only happened... because you didn't raise her properly!
You don't have to say it like that.
What did you say?
You also never paid any attention to her.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You got her on the damn bike, and you ended up surviving!
Aren't you ashamed?
Stop.
Stop, stop.
It's you!
Leave.
It doesn't change the fact that it's your fault Miyuki died.
Can you make up for it?
Huh?
Can you take that guy's job for rest of your life and make up for it?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss will be sad to hear that.
What?
He really liked you.
He did?
Yeah!
You're our first ever employee!
The interview was very simple despite that.
He always acts on his instincts!
He said he felt something in you.
But still...
Sorry, but please talk to him in person if you want to quit.
He's upstairs.
Excuse me.
Come on in.
Okay.
What have you been eating?
What?
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?
Yes...
Eat here.
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.
Let's eat.
What's this?
Blowfish milt.
It's best grilled, with salt.
That's my wife.
Passed away 9 years ago.
All married couples are eventually separated by a death, but it's tough being the one left behind.
I dressed her up, and sent her away.
My very first client.
I've been working in this business ever since.
This too...
This is a corpse too.
The living eat the living to live.
Right?
These plants are an exception.
You have to eat if you don't want to die.
If you're going to eat, might as well taste good.
Tasty, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah it is... sadly.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Will I really be able to make a living with this job?
Do you want to try?
Yes.
Slowly, lower from the head.
Tomeo...
Good bye.
Thank you.
We've been doing nothing but argue since Tomeo started dressing up like that...
I haven't looked straight into his face for a long time.
But... seeing him smile made me think... ah... he really is my child.
Even if he looks like a girl... he really is my child!
Thank you so much!
Tastes great!
Is it tasty?
...Sadly.
Did you bring the cello?
Really?
I want to hear!
I'll play a little bit.
It's my first time listening to a cello live.
You were in an orchestra too, right?
Yes, but it went out of business right away.
How long have you been playing?
Ever since I was in kindergarten.
Wow, for that long?
This is also a children's cello... my father forced me to learn to play this.
Your father had a fine taste.
He's the worst father ever.
He ran a small cafe, but he ran away with a waitress, never came back.
He really was the worst father ever.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Who knows, probably already dead.
Well, what should I play?
Let's see... something Christmassy.
Yeah.
Uh... will different religions bother you?
Don't worry.
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu... we handle all religions here.
Then, for the Holy Night...
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Thank you always for your business.
Yes, tomorrow.
The name of the deceased is...
I will now prepare for her last journey.
Gently cover her toes...
Um...
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.
Okay.
Grandma,
bye-bye.
Thank you for everything, grandma.
...in the name of Jesus Christ...
Amen.
Boss has aged a lot!
Thank you, honey.
Mika!
You haven't been cleaning this place?
Occasionally.
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.
I cleaned twice.
That's not "occasionally".
You're a mess without me, as I thought.
I have something to report too.
What is it?
I'm pregnant.
Wow...
I'm going to be a father?
So please start getting your life together.
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.
I don't care about money.
Let's just live happily together.
Yes, hello?
What?
Now?
What?
!
Okay.
I'll be there right away.
You're going to work at a time like this?
Lady at the bath house... passed away.
She's my wife, Mika.
She collapsed while carrying firewood... and passed away.
She was working 'til the very end.
It'll be lonely around here, without this bath house.
Please wipe her face one by one, and bid her farewell one last time.
Mom...
Mother...
Shiori.
This is good-bye to your grandma.
Mother...
Thank you for everything.
This is where you work?
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.
Please allow me to close the 'window'.
Thank you... see you again.
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?
Thank you.
I guess people get a hunch about these things.
Last winter, the two of us had a little Christmas party.
I didn't expect her to celebrate it at this age.
But... she said she wanted to have one no matter what.
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles... and celebrated together.
Then, out of the blue... she asked me to help her with the firewood.
This must have been what she meant.
I'm good at burning things.
Working here for a long time makes me think... that death... is a gateway.
Death doesn't mean the end, but leaving the present, heading for the next stage.
Truly a gateway.
As a gatekeeper,
I've seen off many people.
"Have a nice trip, see you again", I would say...
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry.
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
What are you doing?
This is it!
Here.
What?
Stone-letter.
"Stone-letter"?
In the ancient times, before humans invented writing... they searched for the stone that resembled their feelings, and gave it to another person.
The person who received the stone, read the other person's feelings by the weight and texture.
For example, smooth texture symbolizing a peaceful mind, and rough texture symbolizing a concern for others.
Thank you.
What did you feel?
It's a secret.
That's a wonderful story.
Who did you hear it from?
My old man.
Does that mean... that big stone too?
Yes, I got it from my father.
I never knew.
"Let's give each other stone-letters every year", he said... yet that was the only time.
Such a lousy father!
Can you play everyday for the unborn baby?
Sure.
What a nice weather.
Good afternoon.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.
What...?
Is she no longer here?
No, uh... my mother-in-law passed away two years ago.
Really?
Oh...
Excuse me, can I see it?
You're not supposed to...
[ Kobayashi Hideki.
Time of death: 7:30 of the 18th, please come and collect his body... ]
I'm back, sorry for taking so long.
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.
What?
Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.
Father passed away.
Whose?
Yours.
What do you mean?
... is what they told me when I called the Yurahama Fishing Association.
Our address was in his belongings.
But I don't even know him...
I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!
And the person he ran away with can take care of him.
It seems he was alone the whole time.
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.
Anyway, we're no longer legally related... tell them I can't sign the documents.
Thanks.
Dai...
Please go for him.
Don't worry about it.
Please, I'm begging you.
I... abandoned my son in Hokkaido.
He was 6 years old.
I fell in love with someone...
"Mommy, mommy"... he cried, but...
I shook off his small arm, and left home.
Your son...
Of course I want to see him, but...
I can't.
Why not?
Just go see him if you want to.
Do all parents who've abandoned their child act like that?
Then you're all too irresponsible!
Please, go for him.
Go and see his last appearance.
Dai...
Boss...
Hey...
Take one you like.
Go ahead.
He was already dead when I showed up this morning.
I was surprised.
I don't know where he came from, but he came to this town by himself.
He worked very hard at the port.
So I let him live in this shack.
I see...
He was a quiet man...
I'm glad someone from his family showed up.
People from the funeral home will be here soon.
Okay.
He's your father.
I'm ashamed to admit...
I don't recognize... his face.
That he looked like this...
It doesn't even ring a bell.
What was this man's life?
He lived for 70-odd years...
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.
He's here.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Can I take him now?
Let's just toss him in.
Yeah.
Um...
Yes?
May I?
No, we can do it.
Just give him a drink after we place him into the coffin.
Ready...
What are you doing?
My husband is... an encoffiner.
Father...
He's my father.
Father...

Winters didn't feel this cold... when I was a child.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Please, this way.
Coming in.
My condolences.
We are here to assist you with encoffining.
May I light up the incense?
Yes.
Thank you for coming.
Looks like she's still alive.
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.
How can you tell?
The body is undamaged.
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.
What a waste, she's beautiful.
Do you want to try?
Yes.
For the deceased's peaceful departure,
I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.
Everyone, please see her off from up close.
I will now begin the cleansing.
It has the thing.
What thing?
The thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing...
Err...
May I have a word with you?
Yes, what is it?
After the cleansing, we apply makeup on the deceased...
We have different makeups for male and female...
Oh... please wait.
Yes.
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?
Men's or girl's?
Come on, which one?
If I gave birth to a girl from the start, this would've never happened...
But thanks to someone's seed...
Girl's is fine then?
Yep.
Female's, please.
Yes.
Tomeo...
"Okuribito"
DEPARTURES
Not many in the audience again today.
Yeah, they should put more effort into advertising.
I know!
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.
My wife's a web designer.
I'll make her do it for free.
What do you think?
More importantly, are you going to be fine?
About what?
Next, the next.
Next what?
You spent so much money on that, gotta start looking for the next one.
Good performance again, everyone.
Good work everyone.
Although the seats were empty...
I think your performances were great.
Um... actually... today... the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki... has something to tell you, so please give him your attention.
You're... disbanded.
See ya.
I finally became an orchestra member.
But it became a past memory in a flash.
This cello is innocent.
Only because it was bought by a loser like me, it lost its job.
In many ways... this cello was too heavy for me.
Thank you very much.
Please cook it immediately.
Yes.
Good bye.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
She gave me an octopus.
I just happened to see our neighbor.
They just caught it this morning.
What's wrong?
Disbanded.
What is?
My orchestra.
I see...
You just have to find the next one.
There won't be a next one.
Someone with my skill level can only go so far... and there's the debt for this cello.
How much?
Don't worry, if it's just around $10,000...
I can pay it back with my job.
$180,000.
$1... $180,000?
Pros all spend that much... it's relatively cheap.
Why did you hide it from me?
I knew you'd be against it.
Why didn't you tell me... about something so important?
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner.
"All the cities around the world are our new homes.
Let's live together on a musical tour."
Those were the words of my marriage proposal.
But the reality is harsh.
No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.
What happened?
This octopus is alive!
You're right.
It's alive.
Hey, Dai... what should we do?
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I think I'll quit.
Quit what?
Cello.
What will you do then?
Go back to the countryside... in Yamagata.
I vote yes!
Huh?
You don't mind?
Well, the house your mom left you... we don't need to pay rent, right?
But you really don't mind?
Yes.
This is a wonderful instrument.
I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life, but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.
As if I was suddenly released from being tied up.
What I believed to be my dream... was probably not my real dream.
The only thing my mother left me, when she died two years ago.
I've been told my father ran the cafe at first, but I have almost no recollection of it.
After he left home for another woman, my mother ran this small cafe, and raised me alone.
Meal's ready.
Okay.
I thought you would hate the countryside more.
No, it's kind of refreshing.
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.
Really?
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.
What will you sell?
This is it!
This, this one!
No age limit, high salary?
In addition, short actual working time?
As a full-time employee!
"NK Agent"?
What kind of company is that?
"A job that helps out journeys."
A travel agency?
Oh, maybe tour guide?
It says "no experience necessary".
I'll go ask for details.
Yeah.
This is it.
Excuse me.
Is this "NK Agent"?
Yes...
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.
Oh, you're here for the interview!
The boss will be back soon, sit here.
Yes, thank you.
I... was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.
Oh...
It's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.
Um... what does this company do?
What?
You came without knowing anything?
It said to help out with journeys...
Uh... that's not what you do?
Boss, he's here for the interview.
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.
Oh, it's you.
You seem more energetic than on the phone.
Thank you.
See?
It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.
Yes.
I brought my resume just in case.
Okay, sit down.
Thank you.
Can you put in lots of hours here?
Huh?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
Eh?
What's your name again?
It's Kobayashi Daigo.
Order his business cards right away.
Got it.
W... wait...
We haven't discussed anything... salaries and other things...
Oh, right.
Let's start with one hand.
"One hand"?
$500?
$5000.
$5000?
!
Too little?
Not at all, I can get that much?
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?
Let's see...
As my assistant at first.
Exactly what...?
To be exact... encoffining.
Encoffining?
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.
It's starting to bloom!
Corpse as in dead people?
You ask funny questions.
No, uh, um...
The job posting said helping out journeys.
I assumed it was a travel agency...
Oh, this is a misprint.
Misprint?
Not "helping out journeys", it's...
"Helping out peaceful departure".
Departure?
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.
This is for today.
No, I can't...
Don't worry!
No...
I'm back.
Welcome back.
Here.
Where did you get this?
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?
Yonezawa-beef?
The highest-grade sirloin.
Wow!
Was it expensive?
I got paid in advance.
You got the job?
Kind of, yes.
Great!
Let's celebrate today.
Sure.
So, what kind of job was it?
Tour guide after all?
Not really...
Sales?
What's the matter?
It wasn't a travel agency.
Oh?
What was it?
Ceremonial event-related...
Like a wedding hall?
Yeah.
They might make you play the cello again!
I'll make sukiyaki right away.
Okay.
This is great!
Looks tasty.
I don't think I'll come back that late.
Get going.
Bye.
Morning.
Hello.
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.
Your business cards are ready.
No misprints.
Are these that uncommon?
This is my first time seeing a real one.
First time?
Yes.
My grandparents passed away before I've grown up, and my mother passed away while I was abroad.
She was already in her grave when I got back.
What about your father?
He left home for another woman when I was 6.
Your mother must have been lonely.
But...
I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before... can really do this job?
You'll get used to it!
To dead bodies?
Yeah.
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy... but change of season...
Do you need help?
...will be very busy for us.
Where does work come from?
Funeral homes.
Funeral homes?
Yes.
Encoffining... used to be done by family members.
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes, then companies like ours appeared.
In short, it's a super-niche industry.
It's pretty heavy.
There are many kinds of coffins.
$500, $1000, $3000.
They differ by that much?
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and carvings on both sides.
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.
Yes, they all burn the same way.
Same ashes.
The last shopping of your life is done by others.
Kind of ironic.
Right.
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Yes, he's here.
Yes, Minato Theater?
Immediately?
Okay.
Is that the boss?
A job.
A job?
Are you from NK?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, there he is.
He's a newcomer to our company...
Kobayashi.
...his name is Kobayashi, the model for today.
Good luck everyone.
Model?
We're going to film right after you finish changing.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Get changed and makeup over there.
Makeup?
Yes.
Boss...
Don't worry.
Go ahead.
Okay.
[ Encoffining Manual ] ...first apply cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Followed by...
The model is coming out!
Not bad.
Um... who's going to see this video?
Don't worry, it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.
In encoffining, we first perform cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust... and also symbolizes the first bath for a new birth.
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing, but for sanitary reasons, nowadays, we use sterilized cloths... to wipe... the body.
Clothing ritual is performed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives... we perform it with utmost care.
After the preparation, we shave the face before applying makeup.
Males in particular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin, it seems as if they have a long mustache, so we shave them thoroughly.
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.
Therefore, we perform it with caution and care...
Ow!
What the...
Ow, ow!
Uh, oh.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!
Uh, oh...
Ow, ow!
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's not so bad.
Welcome home.
I'm home.
What is it?
What happened to your face?
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.
You were shaving at work?
Yeah.
You only use electric shavers at home...
I had no choice, the boss ordered me to do it.
Don't worry, it's not so bad.
Weird company.
No kidding.
Weird... weird company.
The first job came without a warning.
Um... what should I do?
For today... you just have to watch.
Okay.
But man... we hit a bad one.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Well, you'll see.
Don't scare me like that!
Thank you for waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Where is the body?
An old lady living by herself... dead for two weeks.
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful.
See you later.
Who is he?
From the funeral home.
Our employer.
Let's get started.
It stinks!
Ugh.
This way.
Eh?
Help out a little.
Yes.
Hold her feet.
Her feet!
Yes.
You said I only have to watch...
Slowly... gently...
Come on, hold them!
Yes.
Wait, wait...
You can go home for today.
It was a bit too intense for the first job.
Really?
Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!
Hey, did you eat something weird?
No.
Something smells.
Must be your scarf!
No way!
That guy wearing black, he smells!
Ah!
It's still here!
Leave it over there.
Yes.
$3.
Okay.
Thanks.
Towels for $1.
Okay.
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.
I refuse to quit.
Leave already.
I just want the best for you.
You talk just like a civil servant!
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!
Right?
Shiori?
Can I come for the big bath again?
Yes, of course!
For you, grandma will work hard!
Daigo...
Yamashita.
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!
Sorry, I've been busy.
Oh!
You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It sure has been!
I hear you have an amazing job!
Huh?
Well... yes...
What is that instrument called?
Cello, that monster-sized violin.
Right, cello!
He's a great man.
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
If only my son was as talented as he is!
Mom...
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...
Sure, next time.
Bring your wife here next time.
You're married, right?
Yes.
This place is very peaceful without this fool.
Which fool gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!
Oh, I got it!
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I finally figured it out.
Something happen at work?
No.
Let's eat!
Yeah.
Let's eat...
Our neighbor gave it to me.
Oh.
It was just slaughtered this morning, so it's really fresh!
She said we can even eat it raw!
Maybe we should wait a little longer.
Hey...
Are you ok?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dai, you're acting strange...
Hey, come on, Dai...
Hey, you're embarrassing me.
Not here...
Dai?
Hey, wait...
Mika...
Mika...
What exactly... am I being tested for?
Is this my punishment for not seeing my mother off?
What will happen to me?
Strangely, thinking about it made me want to play the cello.
I simply wanted to play the cello while reminiscing my past.
It's so small...
Salmons?
Ah, yes.
They're right by the rocks... over there.
Oh!
Go for it!
It's kind of sad... to climb only to die.
Why work so hard if you're going to die anyway?
I'm sure they want to go back... to their birthplace.
Let's go for lunch.
Lunch.
It's an order from your boss.
Is this a coincidence?
Huh?
That you happened to pass through here.
It's fate.
There's no such thing...
This is your god-given job.
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.
They're angry!
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!
Sorry.
You're late.
It's 5 minutes past already!
I apologize.
You people make a living from the dead.
Brother...
Hurry up, damn it.
I sincerely apologize.
Is there a lipstick your wife liked to use?
What?
To revive a cold body, and grant eternal beauty.
It was calm and precise.
And more than anything, it was filled with affection.
To be present at the last farewell, and send off the deceased.
It was tranquil, and every action seemed elegant.
Thank you very much.
Please allow me to close the lid.
Naomi...
Naomi...
Excuse me...
I'm sorry about earlier today.
No, it's our fault.
Please take these.
Thank you.
That was... the most beautiful she's ever been.
Thank you so much.
It's nothing.
Welcome.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ah!
Don't tell me...
Yes, she's my wife.
Wow!
Nice to meet you.
You've caught a pretty one!
It's not a big deal!
Take your time and warm up.
Yes, thank you.
Good evening.
Oh, hello.
Do you always come here?
I've been coming here for more than 50 years.
Oh!
Maybe I've seen you before...
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.
They use groundwater heated by firewood.
The water feels soft.
That's why it doesn't sting even though it's hot.
I see.
It's the best bath house in Japan!
Right.
See you again, Tsuyako.
Thank you, come again.
Would you like me to help?
It's bad karma to get help from the customer!
You do everything by yourself?
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.
My son who works at a government office tells me I should sell this place so they can build a condo here... but my current customers would be in a fix.
As long as I'm still healthy...
Come on, you're still young.
Give him your support.
What?
Dai is too kind.
He keeps everything to himself.
When his parents split up too...
He never cried in front of his mother.
He cried when he was alone in the bath.
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.
He's like that sometimes.
Please be understanding.
Yes.
How's the water today?
Hmm... so-so.
Oh, shush!
That's great.
It looks good on you.
It's all white!
It's going to get cold starting tomorrow!
Give it to me.
Thanks.
Hey, wanna go for a drink?
Oh, right!
I know a nice bar.
Really?
Let's go!
(With dialect) "Let's go".
Let's go?
Let's go.
Let's go!
It's good!
It's been a long time since we've drunk together like this.
It's like a scene from an enka (traditional Japanese song).
Your mother listened to this kind of music?
They must all be my father's.
Oh, right.
It started out as your father's cafe.
I don't even want to think about him.
Actually, I don't even remember his face.
Don't you want to see him?
Nope.
But... if I did...
If you met him?
I'd knock him out.

BluRay resync by CODYBOSS1969
Winters didn't feel this cold... when I was a child.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Please, this way.
Coming in.
My condolences.
We are here to assist you with encoffining.
May I light up the incense?
Yes.
Thank you for coming.
Looks like she's still alive.
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.
How can you tell?
The body is undamaged.
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.
What a waste, she's beautiful.
Do you want to try?
Yes.
For the deceased's peaceful departure,
I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.
Everyone, please see her off from up close.
I will now begin the cleansing.
It has the thing.
What thing?
The thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing...
Err...
May I have a word with you?
Yes, what is it?
After the cleansing, we apply makeup on the deceased...
We have different makeups for male and female...
Oh... please wait.
Yes.
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?
Men's or girl's?
Come on, which one?
If I gave birth to a girl from the start, this would've never happened...
But thanks to someone's seed...
Girl's is fine then?
Yep.
Female's, please.
Yes.
Tomeo...
"Okuribito"
DEPARTURES
Not many in the audience again today.
Yeah, they should put more effort into advertising.
I know!
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.
My wife's a web designer.
I'll make her do it for free.
What do you think?
More importantly, are you going to be fine?
About what?
Next, the next.
Next what?
You spent so much money on that, gotta start looking for the next one.
Good performance again, everyone.
Good work everyone.
Although the seats were empty...
I think your performances were great.
Um... actually... today... the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki... has something to tell you, so please give him your attention.
You're... disbanded.
See ya.
I finally became an orchestra member.
But it became a past memory in a flash.
This cello is innocent.
Only because it was bought by a loser like me, it lost its job.
In many ways... this cello was too heavy for me.
Thank you very much.
Please cook it immediately.
Yes.
Good bye.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
She gave me an octopus.
I just happened to see our neighbor.
They just caught it this morning.
What's wrong?
Disbanded.
What is?
My orchestra.
I see...
You just have to find the next one.
There won't be a next one.
Someone with my skill level can only go so far... and there's the debt for this cello.
How much?
Don't worry, if it's just around $10,000...
I can pay it back with my job.
$180,000.
$1... $180,000?
Pros all spend that much... it's relatively cheap.
Why did you hide it from me?
I knew you'd be against it.
Why didn't you tell me... about something so important?
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner.
"All the cities around the world are our new homes.
Let's live together on a musical tour."
Those were the words of my marriage proposal.
But the reality is harsh.
No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.
What happened?
This octopus is alive!
You're right.
It's alive.
Hey, Dai... what should we do?
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I think I'll quit.
Quit what?
Cello.
What will you do then?
Go back to the countryside... in Yamagata.
I vote yes!
Huh?
You don't mind?
Well, the house your mom left you... we don't need to pay rent, right?
But you really don't mind?
Yes.
This is a wonderful instrument.
I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life, but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.
As if I was suddenly released from being tied up.
What I believed to be my dream... was probably not my real dream.
The only thing my mother left me, when she died two years ago.
I've been told my father ran the cafe at first, but I have almost no recollection of it.
After he left home for another woman, my mother ran this small cafe, and raised me alone.
Meal's ready.
Okay.
I thought you would hate the countryside more.
No, it's kind of refreshing.
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.
Really?
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.
What will you sell?
This is it!
This, this one!
No age limit, high salary?
In addition, short actual working time?
As a full-time employee!
"NK Agent"?
What kind of company is that?
"A job that helps out journeys."
A travel agency?
Oh, maybe tour guide?
It says "no experience necessary".
I'll go ask for details.
Yeah.
This is it.
Excuse me.
Is this "NK Agent"?
Yes...
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.
Oh, you're here for the interview!
The boss will be back soon, sit here.
Yes, thank you.
I... was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.
Oh...
It's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.
Um... what does this company do?
What?
You came without knowing anything?
It said to help out with journeys...
Uh... that's not what you do?
Boss, he's here for the interview.
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.
Oh, it's you.
You seem more energetic than on the phone.
Thank you.
See?
It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.
Yes.
I brought my resume just in case.
Okay, sit down.
Thank you.
Can you put in lots of hours here?
Huh?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
Eh?
What's your name again?
It's Kobayashi Daigo.
Order his business cards right away.
Got it.
W... wait...
We haven't discussed anything...
salaries and other things...
Oh, right.
Let's start with one hand.
"One hand"?
$500?
$5000.
$5000?
!
Too little?
Not at all, I can get that much?
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?
Let's see...
As my assistant at first.
Exactly what...?
To be exact... encoffining.
Encoffining?
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.
It's starting to bloom!
Corpse as in dead people?
You ask funny questions.
No, uh, um...
The job posting said helping out journeys.
I assumed it was a travel agency...
Oh, this is a misprint.
Misprint?
Not "helping out journeys", it's...
"Helping out peaceful departure".
Departure?
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.
This is for today.
No, I can't...
Don't worry!
No...
I'm back.
Welcome back.
Here.
Where did you get this?
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?
Yonezawa-beef?
The highest-grade sirloin.
Wow!
Was it expensive?
I got paid in advance.
You got the job?
Kind of, yes.
Great!
Let's celebrate today.
Sure.
So, what kind of job was it?
Tour guide after all?
Not really...
Sales?
What's the matter?
It wasn't a travel agency.
Oh?
What was it?
Ceremonial event-related...
Like a wedding hall?
Yeah.
They might make you play the cello again!
I'll make sukiyaki right away.
Okay.
This is great!
Looks tasty.
I don't think I'll come back that late.
Get going.
Bye.
Morning.
Hello.
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.
Your business cards are ready.
No misprints.
Are these that uncommon?
This is my first time seeing a real one.
First time?
Yes.
My grandparents passed away before I'd grown up, and my mother passed away while I was abroad.
She was already in her grave when I got back.
What about your father?
He left home for another woman when I was 6.
Your mother must have been lonely.
But...
I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before... can really do this job?
You'll get used to it!
To dead bodies?
Yeah.
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy... but change of season...
Do you need help?
...will be very busy for us.
Where does work come from?
Funeral homes.
Funeral homes?
Yes.
Encoffining... used to be done by family members.
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes, then companies like ours appeared.
In short, it's a super-niche industry.
It's pretty heavy.
There are many kinds of coffins.
$500, $1000, $3000.
They differ by that much?
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and carvings on both sides.
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.
Yes, they all burn the same way.
Same ashes.
The last shopping of your life is done by others.
Kind of ironic.
Right.
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Yes, he's here.
Yes, Minato Theater?
Immediately?
Okay.
Is that the boss?
A job.
A job?
Are you from NK?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, there he is.
He's a newcomer to our company...
Kobayashi.
His name is Kobayashi, the model for today.
Good luck everyone!
Model?
We're going to film right after you finish changing.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Get changed and makeup over there.
Makeup?
Yes.
Boss...
Don't worry.
Go ahead.
Okay.
[ Encoffining Manual ] ...first apply cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Followed by...
The model is coming out!
Not bad.
Um... who's going to see this video?
Don't worry, it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.
In encoffining, we first perform cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust... and also symbolizes the first bath for a new birth.
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing, but for sanitary reasons, nowadays, we use sterilized cloths... to wipe... the body.
Clothing ritual is performed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives... we perform it with utmost care.
After the preparation, we shave the face before applying makeup.
Males in particular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin, it seems as if they have a long mustache, so we shave them thoroughly.
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.
Therefore, we perform it with caution and care...
Ow!
What the...
Ow, ow!
Uh, oh.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!
Uh, oh...
Ow, ow!
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's not so bad.
Welcome home.
I'm home.
What is it?
What happened to your face?
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.
You were shaving at work?
Yeah.
You only use electric shavers at home...
I had no choice, the boss ordered me to do it.
Don't worry, it's not so bad.
Weird company.
No kidding.
Weird... weird company.
The first job came without a warning.
Um... what should I do?
For today... you just have to watch.
Okay.
But man... we hit a bad one.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Well, you'll see.
Don't scare me like that!
Thank you for waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Where is the body?
An old lady living by herself...
dead for two weeks.
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful.
See you later.
Who is he?
From the funeral home.
Our employer.
Let's get started.
It stinks!
Ugh.
This way.
Eh?
Help out a little.
Yes.
Hold her feet.
Her feet!
Yes.
You said I only have to watch...
Slowly... gently...
Come on, hold them!
Yes.
Wait, wait...
You can go home for today.
It was a bit too intense for the first job.
Really?
Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!
Hey, did you eat something weird?
No.
Something smells.
Must be your scarf!
No way!
That guy wearing black, he smells!
Ah!
It's still here!
Leave it over there.
Yes.
$3.
Okay.
Thanks.
Towels for $1.
Okay.
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.
I refuse to quit.
Leave already.
I just want the best for you.
You talk just like a civil servant!
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!
Right?
Shiori?
Can I come for the big bath again?
Yes, of course!
For you, grandma will work hard!
Daigo...
Yamashita.
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!
Sorry, I've been busy.
Oh!
You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It sure has been!
I hear you have an amazing job!
Huh?
Well... yes...
What is that instrument called?
Cello, that monster-sized violin.
Right, cello!
He's a great man.
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
If only my son was as talented as he is!
Mom...
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...
Sure, next time.
Bring your wife here next time.
You're married, right?
Yes.
This place is very peaceful without this fool.
Which fool gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!
Oh, I got it!
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I finally figured it out.

No.

It's my father's favorite.
I think... your mom loved your dad the whole time.
No way.
Otherwise she would've thrown out all the records.
She wouldn't have sorted them.
Yes?
I want you to go right away.
What?
Now?
Yes, someone hung himself in the Star Hotel by the station.
What about the boss?
He just left for another client.
Please go by yourself today.
Okay?
Okay.
Have a good day.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Morning.
Thanks for last night.
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.
I gave it everything I've got.
I see.
It's really cold today.
Yeah.
Here.
Thank you.
Bloodshot eyes!
Didn't get any sleep?
This job is mentally draining.
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?
Thanks for the tea.
A lot happened when I was young.
I couldn't stay over there...
Where?
Hokkaido.
None of my past jobs lasted.
I just happened to end up in a cafe in this town.
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage... and died all of a sudden!
Then, our boss came...
That was when I witnessed encoffining for the first time.
Made me think... when I die, I want this person to do it for me.
He's completely different from others.
That's how I ended up here.
Fate plays funny tricks on people.
Never know what'll happen.
You're right.
Tastes great.
Hey, Yamashita.
Is he a friend of yours?
Good afternoon!
Good afternoon!
You don't have to greet him.
Honey...
Go on.
I'll catch up.
There's a rumor going around.
About what?
It's none of my business, but find a proper job!
Let's go!
Come!
I'm home.
Mika?
Mika...
What's wrong?
...make sure the relatives cannot see the cotton stuffing taking place...
At times, we may need to stuff the anus as well.
Roll up the cotton like this, and... push in all the way inside the anus to prevent an outflow of body fluid.
What's this?
You looked through my desk without my permission?
That's not the issue.
I just happened to be a model for this...
I found out about your job too.
So... what?
Why didn't you tell me?
You would've been against it...
Of course!
Doing this kind of job... aren't you ashamed of it?
Why should I be?
Because I touch dead people every day?
I just want you to have a normal job.
What's normal?
Everyone dies.
I'll eventually die, and so will you.
Death itself is normal.
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.
Please.
I've never complained until now.
When you wanted to quit the cello... and when you said you wanted to come back to the countryside...
I followed you with a smile.
Of course, I was actually sad.
But... because I love you...
So please... just this once,
do what I ask.
And if I said no?
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?
I'm going back to my parent's home.
Come and get me after you quit your job.
Mika...
Don't touch me!
Filthy!
It's wrong.
Huh?
My daughter didn't look like this.
Her hair color is wrong... it's all wrong!
That's what she looks like!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong.
Redo it.
Yes.
Why are you saying this now?
This only happened... because you didn't raise her properly!
You don't have to say it like that.
What did you say?
You also never paid any attention to her.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You got her on the damn bike, and you ended up surviving!
Aren't you ashamed?
Stop.
Stop, stop.
It's you!
Leave.
It doesn't change the fact that it's your fault Miyuki died.
Can you make up for it?
Huh?
Can you take that guy's job for the rest of your life and make up for it?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss will be sad to hear that.
What?
He really liked you.
He did?
Yeah!
You're our first ever employee!
The interview was very simple despite that.
He always acts on his instincts!
He said he felt something in you.
But still...
Sorry, but please talk to him in person if you want to quit.
He's upstairs.
Excuse me.
Come on in.
Okay.
What have you been eating?
What?
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?
Yes...
Eat here.
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.
Let's eat.
What's this?
Blowfish milt.
It's best grilled, with salt.
That's my wife.
Passed away 9 years ago.
All married couples are eventually separated by a death, but it's tough being the one left behind.
I dressed her up, and sent her away.
My very first client.
I've been working in this business ever since.
This too...
This is a corpse too.
The living eat the living to live.
Right?
These plants are an exception.
You have to eat if you don't want to die.
If you're going to eat, might as well taste good.
Tasty, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah it is... sadly.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Will I really be able to make a living with this job?
Do you want to try?
Yes.
Slowly, lower from the head.
Tomeo...
Good bye.
Thank you.
We've been doing nothing but argue since Tomeo started dressing up like that...
I haven't looked straight into his face for a long time.
But... seeing him smile made me think... ah... he really is my child.
Even if he looks like a girl... he really is my child!
Thank you so much!
Tastes great!
Is it tasty?
...Sadly.
Did you bring the cello?
Really?
I want to hear!
I'll play a little bit.
It's my first time listening to a cello live.
You were in an orchestra too, right?
Yes, but it went out of business right away.
How long have you been playing?
Ever since I was in kindergarten.
Wow, for that long?
This is also a children's cello... my father forced me to learn to play this.
Your father had a fine taste.
He's the worst father ever.
He ran a small cafe, but he ran away with a waitress, never came back.
He really was the worst father ever.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Who knows, probably already dead.
Well, what should I play?
Let's see... something Christmassy.
Yeah.
Uh... will different religions bother you?
Don't worry.
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu... we handle all religions here.
Then, for the Holy Night...
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Thank you always for your business.
Yes, tomorrow.
The name of the deceased is...
I will now prepare her for her last journey.
Gently cover her toes...
Um...
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.
Okay.
Grandma,
bye-bye.
Thank you for everything, grandma.
...in the name of Jesus Christ...
Amen.
Boss has aged a lot!
Thank you, honey.
Mika!
You haven't been cleaning this place?
Occasionally.
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.
I cleaned twice.
That's not "occasionally".
You're a mess without me, as I thought.
I have something to report too.
What is it?
I'm pregnant.
Wow...
I'm going to be a father?
So please start getting your life together.
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.
I don't care about money.
Let's just live happily together.
Yes, hello?
What?
Now?
What?
!
Okay.
I'll be there right away.
You're going to work at a time like this?
Lady at the bath house... passed away.
She's my wife, Mika.
She collapsed while carrying firewood... and passed away.
She was working 'til the very end.
It'll be lonely around here, without this bath house.
Please wipe her face one by one, and bid her farewell one last time.
Mom...
Mother...
Shiori.
This is good-bye to your grandma.
Mother...
Thank you for everything.
This is where you work?
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.
Please allow me to close the 'window'.
Thank you... see you again.
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?
Thank you.
I guess people get a hunch about these things.
Last winter, the two of us had a little Christmas party.
I didn't expect her to celebrate it at this age.
But... she said she wanted to have one no matter what.
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles... and celebrated together.
Then, out of the blue... she asked me to help her with the firewood.
This must have been what she meant.
I'm good at burning things.
Working here for a long time makes me think... that death... is a gateway.
Death doesn't mean the end, but leaving the present, heading for the next stage.
Truly a gateway.
As a gatekeeper,
I've seen off many people.
"Have a nice trip, see you again", I would say...
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry.
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
What are you doing?
This is it!
Here.
What?
Stone-letter.
"Stone-letter"?
In the ancient times, before humans invented writing... they searched for the stone that resembled their feelings, and gave it to another person.
The person who received the stone, read the other person's feelings by the weight and texture.
For example, smooth texture symbolizing a peaceful mind, and rough texture symbolizing a concern for others.
Thank you!
What did you feel?
It's a secret.
That's a wonderful story.
Who did you hear it from?
My old man.
Does that mean... that big stone too?
Yes, I got it from my father.
I never knew.
"Let's give each other stone-letters every year", he said... yet that was the only time.
Such a lousy father!
Can you play every day for the unborn baby?
Sure.
What nice weather.
Good afternoon.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.
What...?
Is she no longer here?
No, uh... my mother-in-law passed away two years ago.
Really?
Oh...
Excuse me, can I see it?
You're not supposed to...
[ Kobayashi Hideki. ] [ Time of death: 7:30 of the 18th, ]
[ Please come and collect his body... ]
I'm back, sorry for taking so long.
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.
What?
Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.
Father passed away.
Whose?
Yours.
What do you mean?
... is what they told me when I called the Yurahama Fishing Association.
Our address was in his belongings.
But I don't even know him...
I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!
And the person he ran away with can take care of him.
It seems he was alone the whole time.
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.
Anyway, we're no longer legally related... tell them I can't sign the documents.
Thanks.
Dai...
Please go for him.
Don't worry about it.
Please, I'm begging you.
I... abandoned my son in Hokkaido.
He was 6 years old.
I fell in love with someone...
"Mommy, mommy"... he cried, but...
I shook off his small arm, and left home.
Your son...
Of course I want to see him, but...
I can't.
Why not?
Just go see him if you want to.
Do all parents who've abandoned their child act like that?
Then you're all too irresponsible!
Please, go for him.
Go and see his last appearance.
Dai...
Boss...
Hey...
Take one you like.
Go ahead.
He was already dead when I showed up this morning.
I was surprised.
I don't know where he came from, but he came to this town by himself.
He worked very hard at the port.
So I let him live in this shack.
I see...
He was a quiet man...
I'm glad someone from his family showed up.
People from the funeral home will be here soon.
Okay.
He's your father.
I'm ashamed to admit...
I don't recognize... his face.
That he looked like this...
It doesn't even ring a bell.
What was this man's life?
He lived for 70-odd years...
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.
He's here.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Can I take him now?
Let's just toss him in.
Yeah.
Um...
Yes?
May I?
No, we can do it.
Just give him a drink after we place him into the coffin.
Ready...
What are you doing?
My husband is... an encoffiner.
Father...
He's my father.
Father...

When I was a child winter didn't feel so cold.
It's nearly two months since I moved home from Tokyo.
It's been an awkward time.
(In Mourning)
This way.
Excuse us.
Please accept our condolences.
We are here for the encoffinment.
May we offer incense?
Please do.
She looks alive.
Suicide by charcoal.
How do you know?
No agony.
And they probably found her right away.
Too bad... she's beautiful.
Want to do it?
All right.
The rite of encoffinment is to prepare the deceased for a peaceful departure.
Please come closer and watch.
I will now wipe the body.
She's got one.
Got what?
A thing.
What thing?
A 'thing'!
Excuse me...
Yes?
Once the departed is dressed, we will apply make-up.
We have make-up for women, or for men...
Oh... just a minute.
How'd you like Tomeo made up, Sis?
Boy, or girl?
What'll it be?
If I'd only had him as a girl at the first, none of this... would've happened.
Girl, then?
Yes.
As a girl, please.
Certainly.
Tomeo!
Departures
Another empty house.
We should advertise more.
I know!
An orchestra website.
My wife's a web designer.
She'd do it for free.
Forget that, Daigo.
Are you OK?
Huh?
Your next gig.
Next?
You'll need a job to pay off a cello like that.
Well done, everybody.
The audience was a little sparse, but you played wonderfully.
However, as it turns out... the owner of this orchestra, Mr Sonezaki, has a few words to say.
So if you would please give him your attention...
The orchestra is dissolved.
See you.
The orchestra job
I'd finally managed to land... in a flash was not history, only a memory.
It wasn't the cello's fault.
I shouldn't have bought it.
Now I'd lost my job.
In many ways that cello... had been too much for me.
Thank you!
Goodbye.
I'm home!
Hi.
I got an octopus.
From the neighbor.
Caught this morning.
What's the matter?
We're dissolved.
Who?
The orchestra.
Oh...
You'll find another one.
There won't be one.
I'm not good enough.
And I owe for that.
How much?
That's OK.
I'm working.
We can pay off a million yen.
18 million.
18 million yen!
That's what all the pros pay.
Maybe even more.
Why did you hide that?
I thought you'd say no.
But something that important...
why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry.
I'll make supper.
'The world's cities will be our home.
'Come tour with me.'
That's how I proposed.
But reality was harsh.
No.
I should have realized the limits to my talent.
What's wrong?
It's alive!
Yeah!
What should we do?
!
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I should quit.
What?
Cello.
And do what?
Go back up to Yamagata.
Agreed!
You don't mind?
We can live free in the house your mother left you.
It's really OK?
This was my great turning point... but in a strange way, selling the cello was a relief.
I felt freed from ties that had bound me for so long.
What I'd always taken as my dream maybe hadn't been one after all.
'Harmony'
This was all my mother had left me when she'd died two years before.
My father had run a coffee shop here... but I hardly remembered it.
After he deserted us... she ran it as a small bar... and raised me alone.
Supper's ready!
Coming!
I thought you'd hate it here.
No!
Everything's so new.
Rice tastes better.
Maybe it's the water.
Maybe I should open a shop...
What kind?
Hey!
This ad. 'No age restriction, good salary.
'Short working hours, full-time employee.'
'NK Agent'... what's that?
'Working with departures.' A travel agency, maybe.
A tour guide?
'No experience necessary.' I'll give them a call.
Here.
NK Agent
Hello?
Is this NK Agent?
Yes.
I'm Kobayashi.
I called earlier.
For the interview?
The boss'll be right back.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
I was against the boss putting an ad in the paper.
It's hard finding people for this.
What sort of company would this be?
You mean you don't know?
It said 'departures'...
No?
The man's here about the job.
Hello.
I phoned this morning.
Oh, you...
So you're not depressing...
Thank you.
I knew an ad would work.
Make some tea.
My resume...
Good.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Will you work hard?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
What's your name?
'Daigo Kobayashi'.
Get him some cards.
OK.
But what about salary and stuff like that?
Oh... how about one hand to start?
'One hand'?
50,000?
500.
500,000?
!
Too low?
You pay that much?
In cash, if you want.
What does the job involve?
Well...
At first, being my assistant, I guess.
Specifically...
'Specifically'?
Casketing.
'Casketing'?
Putting bodies in coffins.
It bloomed!
You mean 'dead bodies'?
That's really funny.
Uh, no, I mean...
The ad said 'departures', so I thought it meant... a travel agency.
That's a misprint.
It's not 'departures', it's... 'the departed'.
The departed?
!
'NK' stands for [nokan], 'casketing'.
Anyway, fate brought you here.
Give it a try.
Quit if you don't like it.
Today's pay.
No, I couldn't...
It's fine.
No, no...
I'm back.
Hi.
Here.
What's that?
You said you wanted sukiyaki.
Yonezawa beef?
!
Grade A.
That's expensive!
I got an advance.
You got the job?
Sort of.
So we're celebrating!
So what's the job?
A tour guide?
No...
Sales?
What?
It's not a travel agent.
So what is it?
Ceremonies.
Like weddings?
Maybe you can play cello for them.
I'll get the sukiyaki ready.
OK.
I won't be too late.
'Bye.
'Morning.
Here I am.
Use the boss's desk till yours comes.
Your business cards are done.
No misprints.
They're just coffins.
They're the first I've seen.
The first?
My grandparents died before I can remember.
I was abroad when my mom died, so I missed her funeral.
And your dad?
He left us when I was six.
That must have been hard for your mom.
Can someone who's never seen a corpse actually do this job?
You'll get used to it.
To corpses?
It's slow now in the summer, but when the seasons change...
I'll help.
...it's one job after another.
Who hires us?
Undertakers.
Undertakers?
It used to be that families prepared the bodies.
Then undertakers took it on... and places like ours started up.
It's a niche market.
They're heavy.
There's different types.
50,000.
100,000.
300,000.
They're that different?
That's plywood, this one has gold fittings and carved sides.
And this one's pure hinoki cypress.
So it's the wood and the fittings...
Yep.
They burn the same way, into the same ashes.
Your last purchase, and someone else chooses it.
It's ironic.
NK Agent...
Yes, he's here.
The Minatoza?
He'll be right there.
The boss?
A job.
A job?
(Minatoza Theater)
NK Agent?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, good.
This is my new assistant, uh...
'Kobayashi'.
Kobayashi.
He'll be our model today.
Model?
We'll start shooting as soon as you get changed.
Costume and make-up's over here.
Make-up?
Sir...
It's fine.
Let's start.
(Casketing Procedure)
The model's ready!
Good.
Where will this be shown?
It's fine.
It's just for the trade.
No one'll see it.
The first step in casketing is washing of the body.
This washes away the weariness, pain, and cares of this world... and represents the first bath for one newborn in the next.
In olden times, a wash-cloth was used for this, but now, for reasons of hygiene, a sterilized cloth is used
to wipe... the body.
To preserve dignity, take great care that family members do not see the bare skin of the deceased.
Once the body is dressed, the face is shaved before make-up is applied.
Especially with men, facial hair will be more apparent due to tissue contraction and drying of the skin so great care must be taken.
Necrotic skin is extremely fragile.
Even the pressure of a finger can break it.
For this reason, we must proceed... with very great care...
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
He's bleeding!
Ow!
It's fine.
It's just a scratch.
Hi.
What?
Your face...
The boss wanted me shaved.
You shaved at work?
But you only ever use an electric razor.
The boss said to.
It's just a scratch.
That's weird.
Yeah, it's a weird place.
Suddenly, my first case.
What should I do?
Today... just watch.
All right.
But it's one of those.
You picked a bad one.
What do you mean?
You'll see.
Don't scare me!
Here we are.
Ah, good.
Where's the body?
Old lady, lived alone.
Dead two weeks.
She's in pretty bad shape.
See you later.
Who's that?
The undertaker.
Our employer.
Let's get to work.
It stinks!
Come on.
Give me a hand.
Get her legs.
Her legs!
Right.
You said just to watch.
Gently, gently...
Hold her tighter!
Take the day off.
That was a bit much for your first job.
Did you eat something weird?
No.
Something stinks.
Your scarf!
It does not!
No?
- Hey...
- What?
That guy in the suit...
Next stop, Minami-Ginza.
(Tsurunoyu Public Bath)
It's still here!
Just leave it there.
300 yen.
Thanks.
Towel's 100 yen.
You'll get a good price now!
I'm not quitting!
Go away!
It's for your own good, Ma!
Get back to your city hall.
I'm not that old yet.
Am I, Shiori?
Can I come again for the big bath?
Of course!
I'll keep this bath-house going just for you!
Daigo?
Yamashita...
Why didn't you tell me you're back?
Sorry.
It's been a bit crazy.
Well!
If it's not the Kobayashi boy Daigo!
It's been a while.
That it has!
That's quite the job you found yourself!
Huh?
Uh, yeah...
What's that thing he plays?
The cello.
A great big violin.
That's it, a cello!
That gentleman's really something.
He plays the cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
I wish my son had talent!
Ma!
This isn't a good time.
We'll have a drink.
OK.
Bring the wife along.
You're married, aren't you?
Yes.
When this fool's not here.
And who gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I'm not selling!
There!
Mate?
Mate.
I win.
Anything wrong?
Let's eat.
Mrs Fujii next door gave us this.
Fresh-killed this morning.
You could eat it raw.
Not quite yet...
Are you OK?
Are you OK?
What?
What's the matter?
What's wrong with you?
Hey!
No, Daigo, don't!
Not here!
Daigo?
Hey...
Mika!
Was this a trial I was being put through for not looking after my mother?
Where was I going?
I suddenly wanted to play the cello.
I just wanted to play the cello and let memory rewind.
It's tiny!
Salmon?
Oh... yes.
There, by those rocks.
Go!
Go!
Sad, isn't it.
Coming all this way just to die.
It doesn't seem worth it.
They want to come home.
Back to where they were born.
Let's go eat.
The boss says to.
Why... did you take this road?
Fate.
Yeah, right!
You were born to do this.
That's fine for you to say!
I'm very, very sorry!
He's mad!
Mr Sasaki, please!
I'm sorry.
You're late!
Five minutes late!
I'm very sorry.
You make your living on the dead.
Stop it!
Move it!
I apologize.
May I have your wife's favorite lipstick?
Huh?
One grown cold, restored to beauty for all eternity.
This was done with a calmness, a precision and above all, a gentle affection.
At the final parting, sending the dead on their way everything done peacefully, and beautifully.
Thank you.
I will now affix the lid.
Naomi!
Naomi...
Naomi!
Excuse me!
I'm sorry about what I said.
No.
We were late.
Please have this.
Thank you.
She'd... never looked so beautiful.
Thank you very much.
Nothing.
Come in.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Don't tell me...
Yes.
My wife.
How do you do.
Isn't she a dear!
You're too kind.
Go into the bath and get warm.
Thank you.
'Evening.
Oh, hello.
You always come here?
For 50 years.
I see... well...
It's nice the water's so hot.
She pumps up groundwater and heats it with wood.
That softens it.
It's hot, but it doesn't make you itch.
I see...
Best in the land!
Good night, Tsuyako.
Thank you.
Shall I help you?
It's bad luck to put a customer to work.
You do it all yourself?
Yes, for years.
Since I lost my husband.
My civil-servant son wants me to sell the place for condominiums.
But what would my customers do?
So while I'm still healthy...
You still have a long time.
Look after him.
Daigo's a dear boy.
He takes it all on himself.
When his folks split up, he'd never cry in front of his mom.
But he would when he was alone in that bath.
The poor little thing, his shoulders shaking...
So that's how he is.
Please understand him.
I will.
How was the water?
So-so.
The kerchief suits you.
It's all white!
The cold's set in.
Here.
Thanks.
Let's have a drink.
I know a fine place.
Let's go!
Let's be off.
OK?
OK.
We're off!
That's good!
We haven't done this in ages.
It's like an old song.
Your mom liked this?
They were all dad's.
Right, this was your dad's coffee shop...
Don't remind me.
I don't even remember his face.
Would you like to see him?
No.
But if I did...
If you did...
I'd hit him.
Dad liked this piece.
I bet... your mom stayed in love with your dad.
No.
Then she'd have thrown his records out.
Not kept them so nice.
Go ahead.
Right now.
Right now?
Someone hanged himself in a hotel.
Where's the boss?
He just left on another call.
Can you handle it alone?
All right.
Off you go.
See you.
Good morning.
Good job last night.
The police were impressed.
'He's so young,' they said.
It was all a blur.
Oh?
Isn't it cold!
Here.
Thank you.
Your eyes are red.
Didn't you sleep?
The job grows on you, doesn't it.
How did you get into this business?
Thanks.
Things happened when I was young.
I had to leave my home town.
Obihiro.
I had a bunch of jobs and ended up in a little bar here.
But the owner... took a stroke and died.
Then the boss came.
I'd never seen casketing before.
I thought if I died,
I'd want him to put me in my coffin.
There's no one quite like him, is there.
So here I am.
It's funny how fate works.
You never know where you'll end up.
That's right.
This tea's good.
Hi, Yamashita.
A friend?
Hello!
Ignore him.
Stop it!
Go on ahead.
People are talking.
About what?
Get yourself a proper job!
Let's go.
I'm home.
Huh?
Mika?
Mika?
What's wrong?
This is done in such a way that the family does not see.
The anus must sometimes be blocked.
The cotton wool is rolled and pressed deep into the anus.
This prevents seepage.
What's all that?
You looked in my desk...
Don't change the subject.
I just got this acting job...
I checked what the company does.
So?
Why didn't you say?
You'd say no.
Of course!
Aren't you ashamed having a job like that?
What's to be ashamed of?
Touching dead people?
Just get a normal job.
'Normal'?
Everyone dies.
I'll die, and so will you.
Death is normal.
Spare me the word games!
I want you to quit.
Please.
I haven't said anything so far, have I.
When you wanted to quit the cello and move back up here...
I just smiled.
The fact is, I was all broken up over it.
But...
I love you.
So... just this once... listen to me.
And if I don't?
Will this be a career?
I'm going home.
Come see me when you quit.
Mika!
Don't touch me!
You're unclean!
No.
I'm sorry?
That's not my daughter.
The color's wrong.
It's all wrong!
That's Miyuki!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong!
Do it again.
Certainly.
What's the point now?
You didn't raise her right.
That's why this happened!
Don't talk like that.
What?
!
You didn't pay her much attention, either.
Who are you to talk?
!
You killed her on your bike!
Have you no shame?
!
Stop it!
Stop it!
All of you!
Get out.
It's your fault Miyuki's dead.
Can you make up for that?
Well?
Work all your lives like him at a job no one else would do?
Well?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss'll be disappointed.
He likes you.
He does?
Yes!
You're the first one he's ever made full-time!
He sure hired me fast enough...
The man goes on instinct.
He knew as soon as he saw you.
Even still...
Well, if you're going to quit, can you tell him yourself?
He's upstairs.
Excuse me...
Come in.
Are you eating?
Your wife's still away...
Yes.
Eat.
I'm probably a better cook than you.
Dig in.
What's that?
Puffer roe, grilled with salt.
It's good.
My wife.
She died on me nine years ago.
One of you always goes first, but it's hard being left behind.
I made her beautiful and sent her off.
She was my first.
Then I started this business.
Even this... is a corpse.
The living eat the dead.
Unless they're plants.
Unless you want to die, you eat.
And if you eat, eat well.
Good, huh?
Yes, it is.
So good I hate myself.
It's nearly two months since I moved home from Tokyo.
It's been an awkward time.
Can I really do this job?
Want to do it?
All right.
Lay the head down first, please.
Tomeo!
We'll take our leave.
Thank you.
Once he went like he did, we did nothing but fight.
After that I wasn't seeing him.
But when I saw his smile, I remembered.
'He's my son.
'He may dress as a girl, but he's still my son.'
Thank you very much!
Mmm!
Is it good?
I hate myself.
You brought your cello?
I want to hear it!
Just a bit.
I've never heard one live.
You were in an orchestra?
But it went broke.
When did you start playing?
In kindergarten.
That long ago?
This is a child's instrument.
My dad made me take lessons.
Good for him!
He was a louse.
He had a coffee shop, and he took off with a waitress.
A real bastard.
Where is he now?
Dead, probably.
So... what'll it be?
Well, since it's Christmas...
No problems of religious affiliation?
It's fine.
Buddhist, Christians, Islam, Hindu, we handle anything.
All right, for a holy night...
Hello, NK Agent.
Thank you for calling.
Tomorrow?
And the name of the deceased?
We will now prepare the deceased for her departure.
Slip them over the toes...
Um...
Grandma wanted to wear socks like ours.
Certainly.
Grandma... bye-bye.
Thank you for everything.
...we pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
He's getting old.
Papa...
Thank you!
Mika!
Don't you ever clean?
Sometimes.
Not even once.
Twice.
That's not 'sometimes'.
I guess you need me.
And I've got news.
What?
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to be a father?
So get yourself together, OK?
Will you be able to tell a child what you do?
The other kids will laugh.
I don't care about the money.
Let's be happy.
Hello?
Hi.
Right now?
What?
I'll be right there.
Are you going to work now?
The lady who runs the bath... she's dead.
My wife Mika.
She was carrying firewood.
She dropped dead.
Working right till the end...
The town won't be the same without this bath.
If you would all wipe her face, and take your farewells.
Ma!
Mother!
Shiori...
Grandma's leaving us.
Mother!
Thank you for everything.
You work here?
If you would place your hands together...
I will now close the casket.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
May I watch?
Thank you.
People probably have a premonition of what's coming.
Last year we did Christmas Eve together.
Just like a young couple, at our age!
But she insisted... so we bought a little cake, and lit some candles and celebrated together.
Then all of a sudden she asks me to help her heat the public bath.
Now I know why.
I'm good at fire.
Working here all these years,
I've often thought that maybe death is like a gateway.
Dying doesn't mean the end.
You go through it and onto the next thing.
It's a gate.
And as the gatekeeper
I've sent so many on their way.
Telling them...
'Off you go.
'We'll meet again.'
Ma!
Ma!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Ma!
I'm sorry!
What are you doing?
This one.
Here.
What?
A stone letter.
'Stone letter'?
Long ago, before writing, you'd send someone a stone... that suited the way you were feeling.
From its weight and touch, they'd know how you felt.
From a smooth stone they might get that you were happy or from a rough one that you were worried about them.
Thank you.
What did you feel?
Not telling.
That's a lovely story.
Who told you?
My dad.
You mean... that big rock?
Yep.
I got it from him.
I didn't know that.
He said he'd send me one every year, but that's all I ever got.
That jerk!
Will you play for the baby every day till it's born?
What a nice day!
Hello.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
'Kazuko Kobayashi'?
Doesn't she live here?
My mother-in-law died two years ago.
What?
!
Is that so?
May I see that?
No, don't...
(Name of Deceased Kobayashi, Hideki)
I'm back.
You forgot your cell phone.
Huh?
It's at home... sorry.
Your father's dead.
Mine?
Yes.
What do you mean?
So I called the fishing port.
Our address was in his things.
But who cares now?
I haven't seen him in 30 years.
His girlfriend can tend to him.
They said he was single.
They're cremating him tomorrow.
His body's at the Fishermen's Co-op there.
He's not on our family register.
Tell them I can't sign for him.
Daigo!
Go.
No, it's fine.
Please!
I left... a son in Obihiro.
He was six.
I met someone.
'Mommy!
Mommy!
' my son was crying.
I pushed his little hands away and went running out.
And since then?
I'd love to see him, but I can't.
Why not?
You could go there.
Are parents who dump their kids... always like that?
!
Please!
You have to see him this one last time.
Daigo...
Sir...
Wait.
Take one.
It's fine.
I came in and he was dead.
It was a real shock.
He just turned up in town one day, all alone.
He worked so hard helping out at the harbor... that we let him live in the watchman's cottage.
I see...
He was real quiet, hardly said a word.
I'm glad someone from his family came.
The undertaker's on his way.
So that's your father...
I hate to say it but I don't remember... his face.
I wouldn't know him to see him.
(Hideki Kobayashi)
So what was his life for, anyway?
Living 70-some years and leaving one box of stuff?
In here.
All right?
'Scuse us.
Excuse us.
Can we get started?
Let's get him loaded.
Um...
Yes?
Could I do that?
No, no, we'll do it.
Offer him some water when we get him in.
One, two...
What the?
!
My husband is a professional.
Dad...
Father...

Winters didn't feel this cold... when I was a child.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Please, this way.
Coming in.
My condolences.
We are here to assist you with encoffining.
May I light up the incense?
Yes.
Thank you for coming.
Looks like she's still alive.
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.
How can you tell?
The body is undamaged.
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.
What a waste, she's beautiful.
Do you want to try?
Yes.
For the deceased's peaceful departure,
I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.
Everyone, please see her off from up close.
I will now begin the cleansing.
It has the thing.
What thing?
The thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing...
Err...
May I have a word with you?
Yes, what is it?
After the cleansing, we apply makeup on the deceased...
We have different makeups for male and female...
Oh... please wait.
Yes.
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?
Men's or girl's?
Come on, which one?
If I gave birth to a girl from the start, this would've never happened...
But thanks to someone's seed...
Girl's is fine then?
Yep.
Female's, please.
Yes.
Tomeo...
"Okuribito"
DEPARTURES
Not many in the audience again today.
Yeah, they should put more effort into advertising.
I know!
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.
My wife's a web designer.
I'll make her do it for free.
What do you think?
More importantly, are you going to be fine?
About what?
Next, the next.
Next what?
You spent so much money on that, gotta start looking for the next one.
Good performance again, everyone.
Good work everyone.
Although the seats were empty...
I think your performances were great.
Um... actually... today... the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki... has something to tell you, so please give him your attention.
You're... disbanded.
See ya.
I finally became an orchestra member.
But it became a past memory in a flash.
This cello is innocent.
Only because it was bought by a loser like me, it lost its job.
In many ways... this cello was too heavy for me.
Thank you very much.
Please cook it immediately.
Yes.
Good bye.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
She gave me an octopus.
I just happened to see our neighbor.
They just caught it this morning.
What's wrong?
Disbanded.
What is?
My orchestra.
I see...
You just have to find the next one.
There won't be a next one.
Someone with my skill level can only go so far... and there's the debt for this cello.
How much?
Don't worry, if it's just around $10,000...
I can pay it back with my job.
$180,000.
$1... $180,000?
Pros all spend that much... it's relatively cheap.
Why did you hide it from me?
I knew you'd be against it.
Why didn't you tell me... about something so important?
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner.
"All the cities around the world are our new homes.
Let's live together on a musical tour."
Those were the words of my marriage proposal.
But the reality is harsh.
No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.
What happened?
This octopus is alive!
You're right.
It's alive.
Hey, Dai... what should we do?
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I think I'll quit.
Quit what?
Cello.
What will you do then?
Go back to the countryside... in Yamagata.
I vote yes!
Huh?
You don't mind?
Well, the house your mom left you... we don't need to pay rent, right?
But you really don't mind?
Yes.
This is a wonderful instrument.
I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life, but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.
As if I was suddenly released from being tied up.
What I believed to be my dream... was probably not my real dream.
The only thing my mother left me, when she died two years ago.
I've been told my father ran the cafe at first, but I have almost no recollection of it.
After he left home for another woman, my mother ran this small cafe, and raised me alone.
Meal's ready.
Okay.
I thought you would hate the countryside more.
No, it's kind of refreshing.
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.
Really?
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.
What will you sell?
This is it!
This, this one!
No age limit, high salary?
In addition, short actual working time?
As a full-time employee!
"NK Agent"?
What kind of company is that?
"A job that helps out journeys."
A travel agency?
Oh, maybe tour guide?
It says "no experience necessary".
I'll go ask for details.
Yeah.
This is it.
Excuse me.
Is this "NK Agent"?
Yes...
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.
Oh, you're here for the interview!
The boss will be back soon, sit here.
Yes, thank you.
I... was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.
Oh...
It's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.
Um... what does this company do?
What?
You came without knowing anything?
It said to help out with journeys...
Uh... that's not what you do?
Boss, he's here for the interview.
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.
Oh, it's you.
You seem more energetic than on the phone.
Thank you.
See?
It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.
Yes.
I brought my resume just in case.
Okay, sit down.
Thank you.
Can you put in lots of hours here?
Huh?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
Eh?
What's your name again?
It's Kobayashi Daigo.
Order his business cards right away.
Got it.
W... wait...
We haven't discussed anything...
salaries and other things...
Oh, right.
Let's start with one hand.
"One hand"?
$500?
$5000.
$5000?
!
Too little?
Not at all, I can get that much?
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?
Let's see...
As my assistant at first.
Exactly what...?
To be exact... encoffining.
Encoffining?
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.
It's starting to bloom!
Corpse as in dead people?
You ask funny questions.
No, uh, um...
The job posting said helping out journeys.
I assumed it was a travel agency...
Oh, this is a misprint.
Misprint?
Not "helping out journeys", it's...
"Helping out peaceful departure".
Departure?
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.
This is for today.
No, I can't...
Don't worry!
No...
I'm back.
Welcome back.
Here.
Where did you get this?
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?
Yonezawa-beef?
The highest-grade sirloin.
Wow!
Was it expensive?
I got paid in advance.
You got the job?
Kind of, yes.
Great!
Let's celebrate today.
Sure.
So, what kind of job was it?
Tour guide after all?
Not really...
Sales?
What's the matter?
It wasn't a travel agency.
Oh?
What was it?
Ceremonial event-related...
Like a wedding hall?
Yeah.
They might make you play the cello again!
I'll make sukiyaki right away.
Okay.
This is great!
Looks tasty.
I don't think I'll come back that late.
Get going.
Bye.
Morning.
Hello.
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.
Your business cards are ready.
No misprints.
Are these that uncommon?
This is my first time seeing a real one.
First time?
Yes.
My grandparents passed away before I'd grown up, and my mother passed away while I was abroad.
She was already in her grave when I got back.
What about your father?
He left home for another woman when I was 6.
Your mother must have been lonely.
But...
I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before... can really do this job?
You'll get used to it!
To dead bodies?
Yeah.
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy... but change of season...
Do you need help?
...will be very busy for us.
Where does work come from?
Funeral homes.
Funeral homes?
Yes.
Encoffining... used to be done by family members.
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes, then companies like ours appeared.
In short, it's a super-niche industry.
It's pretty heavy.
There are many kinds of coffins.
$500, $1000, $3000.
They differ by that much?
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and carvings on both sides.
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.
Yes, they all burn the same way.
Same ashes.
The last shopping of your life is done by others.
Kind of ironic.
Right.
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Yes, he's here.
Yes, Minato Theater?
Immediately?
Okay.
Is that the boss?
A job.
A job?
Are you from NK?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, there he is.
He's a newcomer to our company...
Kobayashi.
His name is Kobayashi, the model for today.
Good luck everyone!
Model?
We're going to film right after you finish changing.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Get changed and makeup over there.
Makeup?
Yes.
Boss...
Don't worry.
Go ahead.
Okay.
[Encoffining Manual] ...first apply cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Followed by...
The model is coming out!
Not bad.
Um... who's going to see this video?
Don't worry, it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.
In encoffining, we first perform cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust... and also symbolizes the first bath for a new birth.
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing, but for sanitary reasons, nowadays, we use sterilized cloths... to wipe... the body.
Clothing ritual is performed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives... we perform it with utmost care.
After the preparation, we shave the face before applying makeup.
Males in particular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin, it seems as if they have a long mustache, so we shave them thoroughly.
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.
Therefore, we perform it with caution and care...
Ow!
What the...
Ow, ow!
Uh, oh.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!
Uh, oh...
Ow, ow!
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's not so bad.
Welcome home.
I'm home.
What is it?
What happened to your face?
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.
You were shaving at work?
Yeah.
You only use electric shavers at home...
I had no choice, the boss ordered me to do it.
Don't worry, it's not so bad.
Weird company.
No kidding.
Weird... weird company.
The first job came without a warning.
Um... what should I do?
For today... you just have to watch.
Okay.
But man... we hit a bad one.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Well, you'll see.
Don't scare me like that!
Thank you for waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Where is the body?
An old lady living by herself...
dead for two weeks.
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful.
See you later.
Who is he?
From the funeral home.
Our employer.
Let's get started.
It stinks!
Ugh.
This way.
Eh?
Help out a little.
Yes.
Hold her feet.
Her feet!
Yes.
You said I only have to watch...
Slowly... gently...
Come on, hold them!
Yes.
Wait, wait...
You can go home for today.
It was a bit too intense for the first job.
Really?
Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!
Hey, did you eat something weird?
No.
Something smells.
Must be your scarf!
No way!
That guy wearing black, he smells!
Ah!
It's still here!
Leave it over there.
Yes.
$3.
Okay.
Thanks.
Towels for $1.
Okay.
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.
I refuse to quit.
Leave already.
I just want the best for you.
You talk just like a civil servant!
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!
Right?
Shiori?
Can I come for the big bath again?
Yes, of course!
For you, grandma will work hard!
Daigo...
Yamashita.
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!
Sorry, I've been busy.
Oh!
You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It sure has been!
I hear you have an amazing job!
Huh?
Well... yes...
What is that instrument called?
Cello, that monster-sized violin.
Right, cello!
He's a great man.
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
If only my son was as talented as he is!
Mom...
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...
Sure, next time.
Bring your wife here next time.
You're married, right?
Yes.
This place is very peaceful without this fool.
Which fool gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!
Oh, I got it!
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I finally figured it out.
Something happen at work?
No.
Let's eat!
Yeah.
Let's eat...
Our neighbor gave it to me.
Oh.
It was just slaughtered this morning, so it's really fresh!
She said we can even eat it raw!
Maybe we should wait a little longer.
Hey...
Are you OK?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dai, you're acting strange...
Hey, come on, Dai...
Hey, you're embarrassing me.
Not here...
Dai?
Hey, wait...
Mika...
Mika...
What exactly... am I being tested for?
Is this my punishment for not seeing my mother off?
What will happen to me?
Strangely, thinking about it made me want to play the cello.
I simply wanted to play the cello while reminiscing my past.
It's so small...
Salmons?
Ah, yes.
They're right by the rocks... over there.
Oh!
Go for it!
It's kind of sad... to climb only to die.
Why work so hard if you're going to die anyway?
I'm sure they want to go back... to their birthplace.
Let's go for lunch.
Lunch.
It's an order from your boss.
Is this a coincidence?
Huh?
That you happened to pass through here.
It's fate.
There's no such thing...
This is your god-given job.
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.
They're angry!
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!
Sorry.
You're late.
It's 5 minutes past already!
I apologize.
You people make a living from the dead.
Brother...
Hurry up, damn it.
I sincerely apologize.
Is there a lipstick your wife liked to use?
What?
To revive a cold body, and grant eternal beauty.
It was calm and precise.
And more than anything, it was filled with affection.
To be present at the last farewell, and send off the deceased.
It was tranquil, and every action seemed elegant.
Thank you very much.
Please allow me to close the lid.
Naomi...
Naomi...
Excuse me...
I'm sorry about earlier today.
No, it's our fault.
Please take these.
Thank you.
That was... the most beautiful she's ever been.
Thank you so much.
It's nothing.
Welcome.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ah!
Don't tell me...
Yes, she's my wife.
Wow!
Nice to meet you.
You've caught a pretty one!
It's not a big deal!
Take your time and warm up.
Yes, thank you.
Good evening.
Oh, hello.
Do you always come here?
I've been coming here for more than 50 years.
Oh!
Maybe I've seen you before...
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.
They use groundwater heated by firewood.
The water feels soft.
That's why it doesn't sting even though it's hot.
I see.
It's the best bath house in Japan!
Right.
See you again, Tsuyako.
Thank you, come again.
Would you like me to help?
It's bad karma to get help from the customer!
You do everything by yourself?
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.
My son who works at a government office tells me I should sell this place, so they can build a condo here... but my current customers would be in a fix.
As long as I'm still healthy...
Come on, you're still young.
Give him your support.
What?
Dai is too kind.
He keeps everything to himself.
When his parents split up too...
He never cried in front of his mother.
He cried when he was alone in the bath.
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.
He's like that sometimes.
Please be understanding.
Yes.
How's the water today?
Hmm... so-so.
Oh, shush!
That's great.
It looks good on you.
It's all white!
It's going to get cold starting tomorrow!
Give it to me.
Thanks.
Hey, wanna go for a drink?
Oh, right!
I know a nice bar.
Really?
Let's go!
(With dialect) "Let's go".
Let's go?
Let's go.
Let's go!
It's good!
It's been a long time since we've drunk together like this.
It's like a scene from an enka (traditional Japanese song).
Your mother listened to this kind of music?
They must all be my father's.
Oh, right.
It started out as your father's cafe.
I don't even want to think about him.
Actually, I don't even remember his face.
Don't you want to see him?
Nope.
But... if I did...
If you met him?
I'd knock him out.
It's my father's favorite.
I think... your mom loved your dad the whole time.
No way.
Otherwise she would've thrown out all the records.
She wouldn't have sorted them.
Yes?
I want you to go right away.
What?
Now?
Yes, someone hung himself in the Star Hotel by the station.
What about the boss?
He just left for another client.
Please go by yourself today.
Okay?
Okay.
Have a good day.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Morning.
Thanks for last night.
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.
I gave it everything I've got.
I see.
It's really cold today.
Yeah.
Here.
Thank you.
Bloodshot eyes!
Didn't get any sleep?
This job is mentally draining.
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?
Thanks for the tea.
A lot happened when I was young.
I couldn't stay over there...
Where?
Hokkaido.
None of my past jobs lasted.
I just happened to end up in a cafe in this town.
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage... and died all of a sudden!
Then, our boss came...
That was when I witnessed encoffining for the first time.
Made me think... when I die, I want this person to do it for me.
He's completely different from others.
That's how I ended up here.
Fate plays funny tricks on people.
Never know what'll happen.
You're right.
Tastes great.
Hey, Yamashita.
Is he a friend of yours?
Good afternoon!
Good afternoon!
You don't have to greet him.
Honey...
Go on.
I'll catch up.
There's a rumor going around.
About what?
It's none of my business, but find a proper job!
Let's go!
Come!
I'm home.
Mika?
Mika...
What's wrong?
...make sure the relatives cannot see the cotton stuffing taking place...
At times, we may need to stuff the anus as well.
Roll up the cotton like this, and... push in all the way inside the anus to prevent an outflow of body fluid.
What's this?
You looked through my desk without my permission?
That's not the issue.
I just happened to be a model for this...
I found out about your job too.
So... what?
Why didn't you tell me?
You would've been against it...
Of course!
Doing this kind of job... aren't you ashamed of it?
Why should I be?
Because I touch dead people every day?
I just want you to have a normal job.
What's normal?
Everyone dies.
I'll eventually die, and so will you.
Death itself is normal.
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.
Please.
I've never complained until now.
When you wanted to quit the cello... and when you said you wanted to come back to the countryside...
I followed you with a smile.
Of course, I was actually sad.
But... because I love you...
So please... just this once,
do what I ask.
And if I said no?
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?
I'm going back to my parent's home.
Come and get me after you quit your job.
Mika...
Don't touch me!
Filthy!
It's wrong.
Huh?
My daughter didn't look like this.
Her hair color is wrong... it's all wrong!
That's what she looks like!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong.
Redo it.
Yes.
Why are you saying this now?
This only happened... because you didn't raise her properly!
You don't have to say it like that.
What did you say?
You also never paid any attention to her.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You got her on the damn bike, and you ended up surviving!
Aren't you ashamed?
Stop.
Stop, stop.
It's you!
Leave.
It doesn't change the fact that it's your fault Miyuki died.
Can you make up for it?
Huh?
Can you take that guy's job for the rest of your life and make up for it?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss will be sad to hear that.
What?
He really liked you.
He did?
Yeah!
You're our first ever employee!
The interview was very simple despite that.
He always acts on his instincts!
He said he felt something in you.
But still...
Sorry, but please talk to him in person if you want to quit.
He's upstairs.
Excuse me.
Come on in.
Okay.
What have you been eating?
What?
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?
Yes...
Eat here.
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.
Let's eat.
What's this?
Blowfish milt.
It's best grilled, with salt.
That's my wife.
Passed away 9 years ago.
All married couples are eventually separated by a death, but it's tough being the one left behind.
I dressed her up, and sent her away.
My very first client.
I've been working in this business ever since.
This too...
This is a corpse too.
The living eat the living to live.
Right?
These plants are an exception.
You have to eat if you don't want to die.
If you're going to eat, might as well taste good.
Tasty, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah it is... sadly.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Will I really be able to make a living with this job?
Do you want to try?
Yes.
Slowly, lower from the head.
Tomeo...
Good bye.
Thank you.
We've been doing nothing but argue since Tomeo started dressing up like that...
I haven't looked straight into his face for a long time.
But... seeing him smile made me think... ah... he really is my child.
Even if he looks like a girl... he really is my child!
Thank you so much!
Tastes great!
Is it tasty?
...Sadly.
Did you bring the cello?
Really?
I want to hear!
I'll play a little bit.
It's my first time listening to a cello live.
You were in an orchestra too, right?
Yes, but it went out of business right away.
How long have you been playing?
Ever since I was in kindergarten.
Wow, for that long?
This is also a children's cello... my father forced me to learn to play this.
Your father had a fine taste.
He's the worst father ever.
He ran a small cafe, but he ran away with a waitress, never came back.
He really was the worst father ever.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Who knows, probably already dead.
Well, what should I play?
Let's see... something Christmassy.
Yeah.
Uh... will different religions bother you?
Don't worry.
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu... we handle all religions here.
Then, for the Holy Night...
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Thank you always for your business.
Yes, tomorrow.
The name of the deceased is...
I will now prepare her for her last journey.
Gently cover her toes...
Um...
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.
Okay.
Grandma,
bye-bye.
Thank you for everything, grandma.
...in the name of Jesus Christ...
Amen.
Boss has aged a lot!
Thank you, honey.
Mika!
You haven't been cleaning this place?
Occasionally.
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.
I cleaned twice.
That's not "occasionally".
You're a mess without me, as I thought.
I have something to report too.
What is it?
I'm pregnant.
Wow...
I'm going to be a father?
So please start getting your life together.
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.
I don't care about money.
Let's just live happily together.
Yes, hello?
What?
Now?
What?
!
Okay.
I'll be there right away.
You're going to work at a time like this?
Lady at the bath house... passed away.
She's my wife, Mika.
She collapsed while carrying firewood... and passed away.
She was working 'til the very end.
It'll be lonely around here, without this bath house.
Please wipe her face one by one, and bid her farewell one last time.
Mom...
Mother...
Shiori.
This is good-bye to your grandma.
Mother...
Thank you for everything.
This is where you work?
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.
Please allow me to close the 'window'.
Thank you... see you again.
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?
Thank you.
I guess people get a hunch about these things.
Last winter, the two of us had a little Christmas party.
I didn't expect her to celebrate it at this age.
But... she said she wanted to have one no matter what.
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles... and celebrated together.
Then, out of the blue... she asked me to help her with the firewood.
This must have been what she meant.
I'm good at burning things.
Working here for a long time makes me think... that death... is a gateway.
Death doesn't mean the end, but leaving the present, heading for the next stage.
Truly a gateway.
As a gatekeeper,
I've seen off many people.
"Have a nice trip, see you again", I would say...
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry.
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
What are you doing?
This is it!
Here.
What?
Stone-letter.
"Stone-letter"?
In the ancient times, before humans invented writing... they searched for the stone that resembled their feelings, and gave it to another person.
The person who received the stone, read the other person's feelings by the weight and texture.
For example, smooth texture symbolizing a peaceful mind, and rough texture symbolizing a concern for others.
Thank you!
What did you feel?
It's a secret.
That's a wonderful story.
Who did you hear it from?
My old man.
Does that mean... that big stone too?
Yes, I got it from my father.
I never knew.
"Let's give each other stone-letters every year", he said... yet that was the only time.
Such a lousy father!
Can you play every day for the unborn baby?
Sure.
What nice weather.
Good afternoon.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.
What...?
Is she no longer here?
No, uh... my mother-in-law passed away two years ago.
Really?
Oh...
Excuse me, can I see it?
You're not supposed to...
[Kobayashi Hideki.] [Time of death: 7:30 of the 18th,]
[Please come and collect his body...]
I'm back, sorry for taking so long.
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.
What?
Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.
Father passed away.
Whose?
Yours.
What do you mean?
... is what they told me when I called the Yurahama Fishing Association.
Our address was in his belongings.
But I don't even know him...
I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!
And the person he ran away with can take care of him.
It seems he was alone the whole time.
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.
Anyway, we're no longer legally related... tell them I can't sign the documents.
Thanks.
Dai...
Please go for him.
Don't worry about it.
Please, I'm begging you.
I... abandoned my son in Hokkaido.
He was 6 years old.
I fell in love with someone...
"Mommy, mommy"... he cried, but...
I shook off his small arm, and left home.
Your son...
Of course I want to see him, but...
I can't.
Why not?
Just go see him if you want to.
Do all parents who've abandoned their child act like that?
Then you're all too irresponsible!
Please, go for him.
Go and see his last appearance.
Dai...
Boss...
Hey...
Take one you like.
Go ahead.
He was already dead when I showed up this morning.
I was surprised.
I don't know where he came from, but he came to this town by himself.
He worked very hard at the port.
So I let him live in this shack.
I see...
He was a quiet man...
I'm glad someone from his family showed up.
People from the funeral home will be here soon.
Okay.
He's your father.
I'm ashamed to admit...
I don't recognize... his face.
That he looked like this...
It doesn't even ring a bell.
What was this man's life?
He lived for 70-odd years...
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.
He's here.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Can I take him now?
Let's just toss him in.
Yeah.
Um...
Yes?
May I?
No, we can do it.
Just give him a drink after we place him into the coffin.
Ready...
What are you doing?
My husband is... an encoffiner.
Father...
He's my father.
Father...
Translated by 8thSin
Winters didn't feel this cold... when I was a child.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Please, this way.
Coming in.
My condolences.
We are here to assist you with encoffining.
May I light up the incense?
Yes.
Thank you for coming.
Looks like she's still alive.
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.
How can you tell?
The body is undamaged.
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.
What a waste, she's beautiful.
Do you want to try?
Yes.
For the deceased's peaceful departure,
I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.
Everyone, please see her off from up close.
I will now begin the cleansing.
It has the thing.
What thing?
The thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing...
Err...
May I have a word with you?
Yes, what is it?
After the cleansing, we apply makeup on the deceased...
We have different makeups for male and female...
Oh... please wait.
Yes.
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?
Men's or girl's?
Come on, which one?
If I gave birth to a girl from the start, this would've never happened...
But thanks to someone's seed...
Girl's is fine then?
Yep.
Female's, please.
Yes.
Tomeo...
"Okuribito"
DEPARTURES
Not many in the audience again today.
Yeah, they should put more effort into advertising.
I know!
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.
My wife's a web designer.
I'll make her do it for free.
What do you think?
More importantly, are you going to be fine?
About what?
Next, the next.
Next what?
You spent so much money on that, gotta start looking for the next one.
Good performance again, everyone.
Good work everyone.
Although the seats were empty...
I think your performances were great.
Um... actually... today... the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki... has something to tell you, so please give him your attention.
You're... disbanded.
See ya.
I finally became an orchestra member.
But it became a past memory in a flash.
This cello is innocent.
Only because it was bought by a loser like me, it lost its job.
In many ways... this cello was too heavy for me.
Thank you very much.
Please cook it immediately.
Yes.
Good bye.
I'm home.
Welcome back.
She gave me an octopus.
I just happened to see our neighbor.
They just caught it this morning.
What's wrong?
Disbanded.
What is?
My orchestra.
I see...
You just have to find the next one.
There won't be a next one.
Someone with my skill level can only go so far... and there's the debt for this cello.
How much?
Don't worry, if it's just around $10,000...
I can pay it back with my job.
$180,000.
$1... $180,000?
Pros all spend that much... it's relatively cheap.
Why did you hide it from me?
I knew you'd be against it.
Why didn't you tell me... about something so important?
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner.
"All the cities around the world are our new homes.
Let's live together on a musical tour."
Those were the words of my marriage proposal.
But the reality is harsh.
No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.
What happened?
This octopus is alive!
You're right.
It's alive.
Hey, Dai... what should we do?
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I think I'll quit.
Quit what?
Cello.
What will you do then?
Go back to the countryside... in Yamagata.
I vote yes!
Huh?
You don't mind?
Well, the house your mom left you... we don't need to pay rent, right?
But you really don't mind?
Yes.
This is a wonderful instrument.
I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life, but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.
As if I was suddenly released from being tied up.
What I believed to be my dream... was probably not my real dream.
The only thing my mother left me, when she died two years ago.
I've been told my father ran the cafe at first, but I have almost no recollection of it.
After he left home for another woman, my mother ran this small cafe, and raised me alone.
Meal's ready.
Okay.
I thought you would hate the countryside more.
No, it's kind of refreshing.
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.
Really?
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.
What will you sell?
This is it!
This, this one!
No age limit, high salary?
In addition, short actual working time?
As a full-time employee!
"NK Agent"?
What kind of company is that?
"A job that helps out journeys."
A travel agency?
Oh, maybe tour guide?
It says "no experience necessary".
I'll go ask for details.
Yeah.
This is it.
Excuse me.
Is this "NK Agent"?
Yes...
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.
Oh, you're here for the interview!
The boss will be back soon, sit here.
Yes, thank you.
I... was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.
Oh...
It's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.
Um... what does this company do?
What?
You came without knowing anything?
It said to help out with journeys...
Uh... that's not what you do?
Boss, he's here for the interview.
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.
Oh, it's you.
You seem more energetic than on the phone.
Thank you.
See?
It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.
Yes.
I brought my resume just in case.
Okay, sit down.
Thank you.
Can you put in lots of hours here?
Huh?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
Eh?
What's your name again?
It's Kobayashi Daigo.
Order his business cards right away.
Got it.
W... wait...
We haven't discussed anything... salaries and other things...
Oh, right.
Let's start with one hand.
"One hand"?
$500?
$5000.
$5000?
!
Too little?
Not at all, I can get that much?
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?
Let's see...
As my assistant at first.
Exactly what...?
To be exact... encoffining.
Encoffining?
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.
It's starting to bloom!
Corpse as in dead people?
You ask funny questions.
No, uh, um...
The job posting said helping out journeys.
I assumed it was a travel agency...
Oh, this is a misprint.
Misprint?
Not "helping out journeys", it's...
"Helping out peaceful departure".
Departure?
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.
This is for today.
No, I can't...
Don't worry!
No...
I'm back.
Welcome back.
Here.
Where did you get this?
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?
Yonezawa-beef?
The highest-grade sirloin.
Wow!
Was it expensive?
I got paid in advance.
You got the job?
Kind of, yes.
Great!
Let's celebrate today.
Sure.
So, what kind of job was it?
Tour guide after all?
Not really...
Sales?
What's the matter?
It wasn't a travel agency.
Oh?
What was it?
Ceremonial event-related...
Like a wedding hall?
Yeah.
They might make you play the cello again!
I'll make sukiyaki right away.
Okay.
This is great!
Looks tasty.
I don't think I'll come back that late.
Get going.
Bye.
Morning.
Hello.
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.
Your business cards are ready.
No misprints.
Are these that uncommon?
This is my first time seeing a real one.
First time?
Yes.
My grandparents passed away before I've grown up, and my mother passed away while I was abroad.
She was already in her grave when I got back.
What about your father?
He left home for another woman when I was 6.
Your mother must have been lonely.
But...
I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before... can really do this job?
You'll get used to it!
To dead bodies?
Yeah.
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy... but change of season...
Do you need help?
...will be very busy for us.
Where does work come from?
Funeral homes.
Funeral homes?
Yes.
Encoffining... used to be done by family members.
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes, then companies like ours appeared.
In short, it's a super-niche industry.
It's pretty heavy.
There are many kinds of coffins.
$500, $1000, $3000.
They differ by that much?
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and carvings on both sides.
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.
Yes, they all burn the same way.
Same ashes.
The last shopping of your life is done by others.
Kind of ironic.
Right.
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Yes, he's here.
Yes, Minato Theater?
Immediately?
Okay.
Is that the boss?
A job.
A job?
Are you from NK?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, there he is.
He's a newcomer to our company...
Kobayashi.
...his name is Kobayashi, the model for today.
Good luck everyone.
Model?
We're going to film right after you finish changing.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Get changed and makeup over there.
Makeup?
Yes.
Boss...
Don't worry.
Go ahead.
Okay.
[ Encoffining Manual ] ...first apply cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Followed by...
The model is coming out!
Not bad.
Um... who's going to see this video?
Don't worry, it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.
In encoffining, we first perform cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust... and also symbolizes the first bath for a new birth.
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing, but for sanitary reasons, nowadays, we use sterilized cloths... to wipe... the body.
Clothing ritual is performed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives... we perform it with utmost care.
After the preparation, we shave the face before applying makeup.
Males in particular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin, it seems as if they have a long mustache, so we shave them thoroughly.
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.
Therefore, we perform it with caution and care...
Ow!
What the...
Ow, ow!
Uh, oh.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!
Uh, oh...
Ow, ow!
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's not so bad.
Welcome home.
I'm home.
What is it?
What happened to your face?
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.
You were shaving at work?
Yeah.
You only use electric shavers at home...
I had no choice, the boss ordered me to do it.
Don't worry, it's not so bad.
Weird company.
No kidding.
Weird... weird company.
The first job came without a warning.
Um... what should I do?
For today... you just have to watch.
Okay.
But man... we hit a bad one.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Well, you'll see.
Don't scare me like that!
Thank you for waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Where is the body?
An old lady living by herself... dead for two weeks.
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful.
See you later.
Who is he?
From the funeral home.
Our employer.
Let's get started.
It stinks!
Ugh.
This way.
Eh?
Help out a little.
Yes.
Hold her feet.
Her feet!
Yes.
You said I only have to watch...
Slowly... gently...
Come on, hold them!
Yes.
Wait, wait...
You can go home for today.
It was a bit too intense for the first job.
Really?
Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!
Hey, did you eat something weird?
No.
Something smells.
Must be your scarf!
No way!
That guy wearing black, he smells!
Ah!
It's still here!
Leave it over there.
Yes.
$3.
Okay.
Thanks.
Towels for $1.
Okay.
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.
I refuse to quit.
Leave already.
I just want the best for you.
You talk just like a civil servant!
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!
Right?
Shiori?
Can I come for the big bath again?
Yes, of course!
For you, grandma will work hard!
Daigo...
Yamashita.
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!
Sorry, I've been busy.
Oh!
You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It sure has been!
I hear you have an amazing job!
Huh?
Well... yes...
What is that instrument called?
Cello, that monster-sized violin.
Right, cello!
He's a great man.
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
If only my son was as talented as he is!
Mom...
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...
Sure, next time.
Bring your wife here next time.
You're married, right?
Yes.
This place is very peaceful without this fool.
Which fool gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!
Oh, I got it!
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I finally figured it out.
Something happen at work?
No.
Let's eat!
Yeah.
Let's eat...
Our neighbor gave it to me.
Oh.
It was just slaughtered this morning, so it's really fresh!
She said we can even eat it raw!
Maybe we should wait a little longer.
Hey...
Are you ok?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dai, you're acting strange...
Hey, come on, Dai...
Hey, you're embarrassing me.
Not here...
Dai?
Hey, wait...
Mika...
Mika...
What exactly... am I being tested for?
Is this my punishment for not seeing my mother off?
What will happen to me?
Strangely, thinking about it made me want to play the cello.
I simply wanted to play the cello while reminiscing my past.
It's so small...
Salmons?
Ah, yes.
They're right by the rocks... over there.
Oh!
Go for it!
It's kind of sad... to climb only to die.
Why work so hard if you're going to die anyway?
I'm sure they want to go back... to their birthplace.
Let's go for lunch.
Lunch.
It's an order from your boss.
Is this a coincidence?
Huh?
That you happened to pass through here.
It's fate.
There's no such thing...
This is your god-given job.
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.
They're angry!
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!
Sorry.
You're late.
It's 5 minutes past already!
I apologize.
You people make a living from the dead.
Brother...
Hurry up, damn it.
I sincerely apologize.
Is there a lipstick your wife liked to use?
What?
To revive a cold body, and grant eternal beauty.
It was calm and precise.
And more than anything, it was filled with affection.
To be present at the last farewell, and send off the deceased.
It was tranquil, and every action seemed elegant.
Thank you very much.
Please allow me to close the lid.
Naomi...
Naomi...
Excuse me...
I'm sorry about earlier today.
No, it's our fault.
Please take these.
Thank you.
That was... the most beautiful she's ever been.
Thank you so much.
It's nothing.
Welcome.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ah!
Don't tell me...
Yes, she's my wife.
Wow!
Nice to meet you.
You've caught a pretty one!
It's not a big deal!
Take your time and warm up.
Yes, thank you.
Good evening.
Oh, hello.
Do you always come here?
I've been coming here for more than 50 years.
Oh!
Maybe I've seen you before...
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.
They use groundwater heated by firewood.
The water feels soft.
That's why it doesn't sting even though it's hot.
I see.
It's the best bath house in Japan!
Right.
See you again, Tsuyako.
Thank you, come again.
Would you like me to help?
It's bad karma to get help from the customer!
You do everything by yourself?
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.
My son who works at a government office tells me I should sell this place so they can build a condo here... but my current customers would be in a fix.
As long as I'm still healthy...
Come on, you're still young.
Give him your support.
What?
Dai is too kind.
He keeps everything to himself.
When his parents split up too...
He never cried in front of his mother.
He cried when he was alone in the bath.
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.
He's like that sometimes.
Please be understanding.
Yes.
How's the water today?
Hmm... so-so.
Oh, shush!
That's great.
It looks good on you.
It's all white!
It's going to get cold starting tomorrow!
Give it to me.
Thanks.
Hey, wanna go for a drink?
Oh, right!
I know a nice bar.
Really?
Let's go!
(With dialect) "Let's go".
Let's go?
Let's go.
Let's go!
It's good!
It's been a long time since we've drunk together like this.
It's like a scene from an enka (traditional Japanese song).
Your mother listened to this kind of music?
They must all be my father's.
Oh, right.
It started out as your father's cafe.
I don't even want to think about him.
Actually, I don't even remember his face.
Don't you want to see him?
Nope.
But... if I did...
If you met him?
I'd knock him out.
It's my father's favorite.
I think... your mom loved your dad the whole time.
No way.
Otherwise she would've thrown out all the records.
She wouldn't have sorted them.
Yes?
I want you to go right away.
What?
Now?
Yes, someone hung himself in the Star Hotel by the station.
What about the boss?
He just left for another client.
Please go by yourself today.
Okay?
Okay.
Have a good day.
Thanks.
Good morning.
Morning.
Thanks for last night.
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.
I gave it everything I've got.
I see.
It's really cold today.
Yeah.
Here.
Thank you.
Bloodyshot eyes!
Didn't get any sleep?
This job is mentally draining.
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?
Thanks for the tea.
A lot happened when I was young.
I couldn't stay over there...
Where?
Hokkaido.
None of my past jobs lasted.
I just happened to end up in a cafe in this town.
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage... and died all of a sudden!
Then, our boss came...
That was when I witnessed encoffining for the first time.
Made me think... when I die, I want this person to do it for me.
He's completely different from others.
That's how I ended up here.
Fate plays funny tricks on people.
Never know what'll happen.
You're right.
Tastes great.
Hey, Yamashita.
Is he a friend of yours?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You don't have to greet him.
Honey...
Go on.
I'll catch up.
There's a rumor going around.
About what?
It's none of my business, but find a proper job!
Let's go.
Come.
I'm home.
Mika?
Mika...
What's wrong?
...make sure the relatives cannot see the cotton stuffing taking place...
At times, we may need to stuff the anus as well.
Roll up the cotton like this, and... push in all the way inside the anus to prevent an outflow of body fluid.
What's this?
You looked through my desk without my permission?
That's not the issue.
I just happened to be a model for this...
I found out about your job too.
So... what?
Why didn't you tell me?
You would've been against it...
Of course!
Doing this kind of job... aren't you ashamed of it?
Why should I be?
Because I touch dead people everyday?
I just want you to have a normal job.
What's normal?
Everyone dies.
I'll eventually die, and so will you.
Death itself is normal.
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.
Please.
I've never complained until now.
When you wanted to quit the cello... and when you said you wanted to come back to the countryside...
I followed you with a smile.
Of course, I was actually sad.
But... because I love you...
So please... just this once,
do what I ask.
And if I said no?
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?
I'm going back to my parent's home.
Come and get me after you quit your job.
Mika...
Don't touch me!
Filthy!
It's wrong.
Huh?
My daughter didn't look like this.
Her hair color is wrong... it's all wrong!
That's how she look like!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong.
Redo it.
Yes.
Why are you saying this now?
This only happened... because you didn't raise her properly!
You don't have to say it like that.
What did you say?
You also never paid any attention to her.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You got her on the damn bike, and you ended up surviving!
Aren't you ashamed?
Stop.
Stop, stop.
It's you!
Leave.
It doesn't change the fact that it's your fault Miyuki died.
Can you make up for it?
Huh?
Can you take that guy's job for rest of your life and make up for it?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss will be sad to hear that.
What?
He really liked you.
He did?
Yeah!
You're our first ever employee!
The interview was very simple despite that.
He always acts on his instincts!
He said he felt something in you.
But still...
Sorry, but please talk to him in person if you want to quit.
He's upstairs.
Excuse me.
Come on in.
Okay.
What have you been eating?
What?
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?
Yes...
Eat here.
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.
Let's eat.
What's this?
Blowfish milt.
It's best grilled, with salt.
That's my wife.
Passed away 9 years ago.
All married couples are eventually separated by a death, but it's tough being the one left behind.
I dressed her up, and sent her away.
My very first client.
I've been working in this business ever since.
This too...
This is a corpse too.
The living eat the living to live.
Right?
These plants are an exception.
You have to eat if you don't want to die.
If you're going to eat, might as well taste good.
Tasty, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah it is... sadly.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Will I really be able to make a living with this job?
Do you want to try?
Yes.
Slowly, lower from the head.
Tomeo...
Good bye.
Thank you.
We've been doing nothing but argue since Tomeo started dressing up like that...
I haven't looked straight into his face for a long time.
But... seeing him smile made me think... ah... he really is my child.
Even if he looks like a girl... he really is my child!
Thank you so much!
Tastes great!
Is it tasty?
...Sadly.
Did you bring the cello?
Really?
I want to hear!
I'll play a little bit.
It's my first time listening to a cello live.
You were in an orchestra too, right?
Yes, but it went out of business right away.
How long have you been playing?
Ever since I was in kindergarten.
Wow, for that long?
This is also a children's cello... my father forced me to learn to play this.
Your father had a fine taste.
He's the worst father ever.
He ran a small cafe, but he ran away with a waitress, never came back.
He really was the worst father ever.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Who knows, probably already dead.
Well, what should I play?
Let's see... something Christmassy.
Yeah.
Uh... will different religions bother you?
Don't worry.
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu... we handle all religions here.
Then, for the Holy Night...
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Thank you always for your business.
Yes, tomorrow.
The name of the deceased is...
I will now prepare for her last journey.
Gently cover her toes...
Um...
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.
Okay.
Grandma,
bye-bye.
Thank you for everything, grandma.
...in the name of Jesus Christ...
Amen.
Boss has aged a lot!
Thank you, honey.
Mika!
You haven't been cleaning this place?
Occasionally.
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.
I cleaned twice.
That's not "occasionally".
You're a mess without me, as I thought.
I have something to report too.
What is it?
I'm pregnant.
Wow...
I'm going to be a father?
So please start getting your life together.
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.
I don't care about money.
Let's just live happily together.
Yes, hello?
What?
Now?
What?
!
Okay.
I'll be there right away.
You're going to work at a time like this?
Lady at the bath house... passed away.
She's my wife, Mika.
She collapsed while carrying firewood... and passed away.
She was working 'til the very end.
It'll be lonely around here, without this bath house.
Please wipe her face one by one, and bid her farewell one last time.
Mom...
Mother...
Shiori.
This is good-bye to your grandma.
Mother...
Thank you for everything.
This is where you work?
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.
Please allow me to close the 'window'.
Thank you... see you again.
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?
Thank you.
I guess people get a hunch about these things.
Last winter, the two of us had a little Christmas party.
I didn't expect her to celebrate it at this age.
But... she said she wanted to have one no matter what.
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles... and celebrated together.
Then, out of the blue... she asked me to help her with the firewood.
This must have been what she meant.
I'm good at burning things.
Working here for a long time makes me think... that death... is a gateway.
Death doesn't mean the end, but leaving the present, heading for the next stage.
Truly a gateway.
As a gatekeeper,
I've seen off many people.
"Have a nice trip, see you again", I would say...
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry.
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
What are you doing?
This is it!
Here.
What?
Stone-letter.
"Stone-letter"?
In the ancient times, before humans invented writing... they searched for the stone that resembled their feelings, and gave it to another person.
The person who received the stone, read the other person's feelings by the weight and texture.
For example, smooth texture symbolizing a peaceful mind, and rough texture symbolizing a concern for others.
Thank you.
What did you feel?
It's a secret.
That's a wonderful story.
Who did you hear it from?
My old man.
Does that mean... that big stone too?
Yes, I got it from my father.
I never knew.
"Let's give each other stone-letters every year", he said... yet that was the only time.
Such a lousy father!
Can you play everyday for the unborn baby?
Sure.
What a nice weather.
Good afternoon.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.
What...?
Is she no longer here?
No, uh... my mother-in-law passed away two years ago.
Really?
Oh...
Excuse me, can I see it?
You're not supposed to...
[ Kobayashi Hideki.
Time of death: 7:30 of the 18th, please come and collect his body... ]
I'm back, sorry for taking so long.
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.
What?
Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.
Father passed away.
Whose?
Yours.
What do you mean?
... is what they told me when I called the Yurahama Fishing Association.
Our address was in his belongings.
But I don't even know him...
I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!
And the person he ran away with can take care of him.
It seems he was alone the whole time.
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.
Anyway, we're no longer legally related... tell them I can't sign the documents.
Thanks.
Dai...
Please go for him.
Don't worry about it.
Please, I'm begging you.
I... abandoned my son in Hokkaido.
He was 6 years old.
I fell in love with someone...
"Mommy, mommy"... he cried, but...
I shook off his small arm, and left home.
Your son...
Of course I want to see him, but...
I can't.
Why not?
Just go see him if you want to.
Do all parents who've abandoned their child act like that?
Then you're all too irresponsible!
Please, go for him.
Go and see his last appearance.
Dai...
Boss...
Hey...
Take one you like.
Go ahead.
He was already dead when I showed up this morning.
I was surprised.
I don't know where he came from, but he came to this town by himself.
He worked very hard at the port.
So I let him live in this shack.
I see...
He was a quiet man...
I'm glad someone from his family showed up.
People from the funeral home will be here soon.
Okay.
He's your father.
I'm ashamed to admit...
I don't recognize... his face.
That he looked like this...
It doesn't even ring a bell.
What was this man's life?
He lived for 70-odd years...
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.
He's here.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Can I take him now?
Let's just toss him in.
Yeah.
Um...
Yes?
May I?
No, we can do it.
Just give him a drink after we place him into the coffin.
Ready...
What are you doing?
My husband is... an encoffiner.
Father...
He's my father.
Father...

When i was a child winter didn't feel so cold.
It's nearly two months since i moved home from Tokyo.
It's been an awkward time.
This way.
Excuse us.
Please accept our condolences.
We are here for the encoffinment.
May we offer incense?
Please do.
She looks alive.
Suicide by charcoal.
How do you know?
No agony.
And they probably found her right away.
Too bad... she's beautiful.
Want to do it?
All right.
The rite of encoffinment is to prepare the deceased for a peaceful departure.
Please come closer and watch.
I will now wipe the body.
She's got one.
Got what?
A thing.
What thing?
A 'thing'!
Excuse me...
Yes?
Once the departed is dressed, we will apply make-up.
We have make-up for women, or for men...
Oh... just a minute.
How'd you like Tomeo made up, Sis?
Boy, or girl?
What'll it be?
If i'd only had him as a girl at the first, none of this... would've happened.
Girl, then?
Yes.
As a girl, please.
Certainly.
Tomeo!
Departures
Another empty house.
We should advertise more.
I know!
An orchestra website.
My wife's a web designer.
She'd do it for free.
Forget that, Daigo.
Are you OK?
Huh?
Your next gig.
Next?
You'll need a job to pay off a cello like that.
Well done, everybody.
The audience was a little sparse, but you played wonderfully.
However, as it turns out... the owner of this orchestra, Mr Sonezaki, has a few words to say.
So if you would please give him your attention...
The orchestra is dissolved.
See you.
The orchestra job i'd finally managed to land... in a flash was not history, only a memory.
It wasn't the cello's fault.
I shouldn't have bought it.
Now i'd lost my job.
In many ways that cello... had been too much for me.
Thank you!
Goodbye.
I'm home!
Hi.
I got an octopus.
From the neighbor.
Caught this morning.
What's the matter?
We're dissolved.
Who?
The orchestra.
Oh...
You'll find another one.
There won't be one.
I'm not good enough.
And i owe for that.
How much?
That's OK.
I'm working.
We can pay off a million yen.
18 million.
18 million yen!
That's what all the pros pay.
Maybe even more.
Why did you hide that?
I thought you'd say no.
But something that important...
why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry.
I'll make supper.
'The world's cities will be our home.
'Come tour with me. '
That's how i proposed.
But reality was harsh.
No. i should have realized the limits to my talent.
What's wrong?
It's alive!
Yeah!
What should we do?
!
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I should quit.
What?
Cello.
And do what?
Go back up to Yamagata.
Agreed!
You don't mind?
We can live free in the house your mother left you.
It's really OK?
This was my great turning point... but in a strange way, selling the cello was a relief.
I felt freed from ties that had bound me for so long.
What i'd always taken as my dream maybe hadn't been one after all.
'Harmony'
This was all my mother had left me when she'd died two years before.
My father had run a coffee shop here... but i hardly remembered it.
After he deserted us... she ran it as a small bar... and raised me alone.
Supper's ready!
Coming!
I thought you'd hate it here.
No!
Everything's so new.
Rice tastes better.
Maybe it's the water.
Maybe i should open a shop...
What kind?
Hey!
This ad.
'No age restriction, good salary.
'Short working hours, full-time employee. '
'NK Agent'... what's that?
'Working with departures. ' A travel agency, maybe.
A tour guide?
'No experience necessary. ' i'll give them a call.
Here.
NK Agent
Hello?
Is this NK Agent?
Yes.
I'm Kobayashi.
I called earlier.
For the interview?
The boss'll be right back.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
I was against the boss putting an ad in the paper.
It's hard finding people for this.
What sort of company would this be?
You mean you don't know?
It said 'departures'...
No?
The man's here about the job.
Hello.
I phoned this morning.
Oh, you...
So you're not depressing...
Thank you.
I knew an ad would work.
Make some tea.
My resume...
Good.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Will you work hard?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
What's your name?
'Daigo Kobayashi'.
Get him some cards.
OK.
But what about salary and stuff like that?
Oh... how about one hand to start?
'One hand'?
50,000?
500.
500,000?
!
Too low?
You pay that much?
In cash, if you want.
What does the job involve?
Well...
At first, being my assistant, i guess.
Specifically...
'Specifically'?
Casketing.
'Casketing'?
Putting bodies in coffins.
It bloomed!
You mean 'dead bodies'?
That's really funny.
Uh, no, i mean...
The ad said 'departures', so i thought it meant... a travel agency.
That's a misprint.
It's not 'departures', it's... 'the departed'.
The departed?
!
'NK' stands for, 'casketing'.
Anyway, fate brought you here.
Give it a try.
Quit if you don't like it.
Today's pay.
No, i couldn't...
It's fine.
No, no...
I'm back.
Hi.
Here.
What's that?
You said you wanted sukiyaki.
Yonezawa beef?
!
Grade A.
That's expensive!
I got an advance.
You got the job?
Sort of.
So we're celebrating!
So what's the job?
A tour guide?
No...
Sales?
What?
It's not a travel agent.
So what is it?
Ceremonies.
Like weddings?
Maybe you can play cello for them.
I'll get the sukiyaki ready.
OK.
I won't be too late.
'Bye.
'Morning.
Here i am.
Use the boss's desk till yours comes.
Your business cards are done.
No misprints.
They're just coffins.
They're the first i've seen.
The first?
My grandparents died before i can remember.
I was abroad when my mom died, so i missed her funeral.
And your dad?
He left us when i was six.
That must have been hard for your mom.
Can someone who's never seen a corpse actually do this job?
You'll get used to it.
To corpses?
It's slow now in the summer, but when the seasons change...
I'll help.
...it's one job after another.
Who hires us?
Undertakers.
Undertakers?
It used to be that families prepared the bodies.
Then undertakers took it on... and places like ours started up.
It's a niche market.
They're heavy.
There's different types.
50,000.
100,000.
300,000.
They're that different?
That's plywood, this one has gold fittings and carved sides.
And this one's pure hinoki cypress.
So it's the wood and the fittings...
Yep.
They burn the same way, into the same ashes.
Your last purchase, and someone else chooses it.
It's ironic.
NK Agent...
Yes, he's here.
The Minatoza?
He'll be right there.
The boss?
A job.
A job?
NK Agent?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, good.
This is my new assistant, uh...
'Kobayashi'.
Kobayashi.
He'll be our model today.
Model?
We'll start shooting as soon as you get changed.
Costume and make-up's over here.
Make-up?
Sir...
It's fine.
Let's start.
The model's ready!
Good.
Where will this be shown?
It's fine.
It's just for the trade.
No one'll see it.
The first step in casketing is washing of the body.
This washes away the weariness, pain, and cares of this world... and represents the first bath for one newborn in the next.
in olden times, a wash-cloth was used for this, but now, for reasons of hygiene, a sterilized cloth is used
to wipe... the body.
To preserve dignity, take great care that family members do not see the bare skin of the deceased.
Once the body is dressed, the face is shaved before make-up is applied.
Especially with men, facial hair will be more apparent due to tissue contraction and drying of the skin so great care must be taken.
Necrotic skin is extremely fragile.
Even the pressure of a finger can break it.
For this reason, we must proceed... with very great care...
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
He's bleeding!
Ow!
It's fine.
It's just a scratch.
Hi.
What?
Your face...
The boss wanted me shaved.
You shaved at work?
But you only ever use an electric razor.
The boss said to.
It's just a scratch.
That's weird.
Yeah, it's a weird place.
Suddenly, my first case.
What should i do?
Today... just watch.
All right.
But it's one of those.
You picked a bad one.
What do you mean?
You'll see.
Don't scare me!
Here we are.
Ah, good.
Where's the body?
Old lady, lived alone.
Dead two weeks.
She's in pretty bad shape.
See you later.
Who's that?
The undertaker.
Our employer.
Let's get to work.
It stinks!
Come on.
Give me a hand.
Get her legs.
Her legs!
Right.
You said just to watch.
Gently, gently...
Hold her tighter!
Take the day off.
That was a bit much for your first job.
Did you eat something weird?
No.
Something stinks.
Your scarf!
It does not!
No?
- Hey...
- What?
That guy in the suit...
Next stop, Minami-Ginza.
It's still here!
Just leave it there.
300 yen.
Thanks.
Towel's 100 yen.
You'll get a good price now!
I'm not quitting!
Go away!
It's for your own good, Ma!
Get back to your city hall.
I'm not that old yet.
Am i, Shiori?
Can i come again for the big bath?
Of course!
I'll keep this bath-house going just for you!
Daigo?
Yamashita...
Why didn't you tell me you're back?
Sorry.
It's been a bit crazy.
Well!
If it's not the Kobayashi boy Daigo!
It's been a while.
That it has!
That's quite the job you found yourself!
Huh?
Uh, yeah...
What's that thing he plays?
The cello.
A great big violin.
That's it, a cello!
That gentleman's really something.
He plays the cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
I wish my son had talent!
Ma!
This isn't a good time.
We'll have a drink.
OK.
Bring the wife along.
You're married, aren't you?
Yes.
When this fool's not here.
And who gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, i'm not selling!
There!
Mate?
Mate.
I win.
Anything wrong?
Let's eat.
Mrs Fujii next door gave us this.
Fresh-killed this morning.
You could eat it raw.
Not quite yet...
Are you OK?
Are you OK?
What?
What's the matter?
What's wrong with you?
Hey!
No, Daigo, don't!
Not here!
Daigo?
Hey...
Mika!
Was this a trial i was being put through for not looking after my mother?
Where was i going?
I suddenly wanted to play the cello.
I just wanted to play the cello and let memory rewind.
It's tiny!
Saimon?
Oh... yes.
There, by those rocks.
Go!
Go!
Sad, isn't it.
Coming all this way just to die.
It doesn't seem worth it.
They want to come home.
Back to where they were born.
Let's go eat.
The boss says to.
Why... did you take this road?
Fate.
Yeah, right!
You were born to do this.
That's fine for you to say!
I'm very, very sorry!
He's mad!
Mr Sasaki, please!
I'm sorry.
You're late!
Five minutes late!
I'm very sorry.
You make your living on the dead.
Stop it!
Move it!
I apologize.
May i have your wife's favorite lipstick?
Huh?
One grown cold, restored to beauty for all eternity.
This was done with a calmness, a precision and above all, a gentle affection.
At the final parting, sending the dead on their way everything done peacefully, and beautifully.
Thank you.
I will now affix the lid.
Naomi!
Naomi...
Naomi!
Excuse me!
I'm sorry about what i said.
No.
We were late.
Please have this.
Thank you.
She'd... never looked so beautiful.
Thank you very much.
Nothing.
Come in.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Don't tell me...
Yes.
My wife.
How do you do.
Isn't she a dear!
You're too kind.
Go into the bath and get warm.
Thank you.
'Evening.
Oh, hello.
You always come here?
For 50 years.
I see... well...
It's nice the water's so hot.
She pumps up groundwater and heats it with wood.
That softens it.
It's hot, but it doesn't make you itch.
I see...
Best in the land!
Good night, Tsuyako.
Thank you.
Shall i help you?
It's bad luck to put a customer to work.
You do it all yourself?
Yes, for years.
Since i lost my husband.
My civil-servant son wants me to sell the place for condominiums.
But what would my customers do?
So while i'm still healthy...
You still have a long time.
Look after him.
Daigo's a dear boy.
He takes it all on himself.
When his folks split up, he'd never cry in front of his mom.
But he would when he was alone in that bath.
The poor little thing, his shoulders shaking...
So that's how he is.
Please understand him.
I will.
How was the water?
So-so.
The kerchief suits you.
It's all white!
The cold's set in.
Here.
Thanks.
Let's have a drink.
I know a fine place.
Let's go!
Let's be off.
OK?
OK.
We're off!
That's good!
We haven't done this in ages.
It's like an old song.
Your mom liked this?
They were all dad's.
Right, this was your dad's coffee shop...
Don't remind me.
I don't even remember his face.
Would you like to see him?
No.
But if i did...
If you did...
I'd hit him.
Dad liked this piece.
I bet... your mom stayed in love with your dad.
No.
Then she'd have thrown his records out.
Not kept them so nice.
Go ahead.
Right now.
Right now?
Someone hanged himself in a hotel.
Where's the boss?
He just left on another call.
Can you handle it alone?
All right.
Off you go.
See you.
Good morning.
Good job last night.
The police were impressed.
'He's so young,' they said.
It was all a blur.
Oh?
Isn't it cold!
Here.
Thank you.
Your eyes are red.
Didn't you sleep?
The job grows on you, doesn't it.
How did you get into this business?
Thanks.
Things happened when i was young.
I had to leave my home town.
Obihiro.
I had a bunch of jobs and ended up in a little bar here.
But the owner... took a stroke and died.
Then the boss came.
I'd never seen casketing before.
I thought if i died, i'd want him to put me in my coffin.
There's no one quite like him, is there.
So here i am.
It's funny how fate works.
You never know where you'll end up.
That's right.
This tea's good.
Hi, Yamashita.
A friend?
Hello!
Ignore him.
Stop it!
Go on ahead.
People are talking.
About what?
Get yourself a proper job!
Let's go.
I'm home.
Huh?
Mika?
Mika?
What's wrong?
This is done in such a way that the family does not see.
The anus must sometimes be blocked.
The cotton wool is rolled and pressed deep into the anus.
This prevents seepage.
What's all that?
You looked in my desk...
Don't change the subject.
I just got this acting job... i checked what the company does.
So?
Why didn't you say?
You'd say no.
Of course!
Aren't you ashamed having a job like that?
What's to be ashamed of?
Touching dead people?
Just get a normal job.
'Normal'?
Everyone dies.
I'll die, and so will you.
Death is normal.
Spare me the word games!
i want you to quit.
Please.
I haven't said anything so far, have i.
When you wanted to quit the cello and move back up here... i just smiled.
The fact is, i was all broken up over it.
But... i love you.
So... just this once... listen to me.
And if i don't?
Will this be a career?
I'm going home.
Come see me when you quit.
Mika!
Don't touch me!
You're unclean!
No.
I'm sorry?
That's not my daughter.
The color's wrong.
It's all wrong!
That's Miyuki!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong!
Do it again.
Certainly.
What's the point now?
You didn't raise her right.
That's why this happened!
Don't talk like that.
What?
!
You didn't pay her much attention, either.
Who are you to talk?
!
You killed her on your bike!
Have you no shame?
!
Stop it!
All of you!
Get out.
It's your fault Miyuki's dead.
Can you make up for that?
Well?
Work all your lives like him at a job no one else would do?
Well?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss'll be disappointed.
He likes you.
He does?
Yes!
You're the first one he's ever made full-time!
He sure hired me fast enough...
The man goes on instinct.
He knew as soon as he saw you.
Even still...
Well, if you're going to quit, can you tell him yourself?
He's upstairs.
Excuse me...
Come in.
Are you eating?
Your wife's still away...
Yes.
Eat.
I'm probably a better cook than you.
Dig in.
What's that?
Puffer roe, grilled with salt.
It's good.
My wife.
She died on me nine years ago.
One of you always goes first, but it's hard being left behind.
I made her beautiful and sent her off.
She was my first.
Then i started this business.
Even this... is a corpse.
The living eat the dead.
Unless they're plants.
Unless you want to die, you eat.
And if you eat, eat well.
Good, huh?
Yes, it is.
So good i hate myself.
It's nearly two months since i moved home from Tokyo.
It's been an awkward time.
Can i really do this job?
Want to do it?
All right.
Lay the head down first, please.
Tomeo!
We'll take our leave.
Thank you.
Once he went like he did, we did nothing but fight.
After that i wasn't seeing him.
But when i saw his smile, i remembered.
'He's my son.
'He may dress as a girl, but he's still my son. '
Thank you very much!
Mmm!
Is it good?
I hate myself.
You brought your cello?
I want to hear it!
Just a bit.
I've never heard one live.
You were in an orchestra?
But it went broke.
When did you start playing?
In kindergarten.
That long ago?
This is a child's instrument.
My dad made me take lessons.
Good for him!
He was a louse.
He had a coffee shop, and he took off with a waitress.
A real bastard.
Where is he now?
Dead, probably.
So... what'll it be?
Well, since it's Christmas...
No problems of religious affiliation?
It's fine.
Buddhist, Christians, islam, Hindu, we handle anything.
All right, for a holy night...
Hello, NK Agent.
Thank you for calling.
Tomorrow?
And the name of the deceased?
We will now prepare the deceased for her departure.
Slip them over the toes...
Um...
Grandma wanted to wear socks like ours.
Certainly.
Grandma... bye-bye.
Thank you for everything.
...we pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.
He's getting old.
Papa...
Thank you!
Mika!
Don't you ever clean?
Sometimes.
Not even once.
Twice.
That's not 'sometimes'.
I guess you need me.
And i've got news.
What?
I'm pregnant.
I'm going to be a father?
So get yourself together, OK?
Will you be able to tell a child what you do?
The other kids will laugh.
I don't care about the money.
Let's be happy.
Hello?
Hi.
Right now?
What?
I'll be right there.
Are you going to work now?
The lady who runs the bath...
she's dead.
My wife Mika.
She was carrying firewood.
She dropped dead.
Working right till the end...
The town won't be the same without this bath.
If you would all wipe her face, and take your farewells.
Ma!
Mother!
Shiori...
Grandma's leaving us.
Mother!
Thank you for everything.
You work here?
If you would place your hands together... i will now close the casket.
Thank you.
We'll meet again.
May i watch?
Thank you.
People probably have a premonition of what's coming.
Last year we did Christmas Eve together.
Just like a young couple, at our age!
But she insisted... so we bought a little cake, and lit some candles and celebrated together.
Then all of a sudden she asks me to help her heat the public bath.
Now i know why.
I'm good at fire.
Working here all these years, i've often thought that maybe death is like a gateway.
Dying doesn't mean the end.
You go through it and onto the next thing.
It's a gate.
And as the gatekeeper i've sent so many on their way.
Telling them...
'Off you go.
'We'll meet again. '
Ma!
Ma!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Ma!
I'm sorry!
What are you doing?
This one.
Here.
What?
A stone letter.
'Stone letter'?
Long ago, before writing, you'd send someone a stone... that suited the way you were feeling.
From its weight and touch, they'd know how you felt.
From a smooth stone they might get that you were happy or from a rough one that you were worried about them.
Thank you.
What did you feel?
Not telling.
That's a lovely story.
Who told you?
My dad.
You mean... that big rock?
Yep.
I got it from him.
I didn't know that.
He said he'd send me one every year, but that's all i ever got.
That jerk!
Will you play for the baby every day till it's born?
What a nice day!
Hello.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
'Kazuko Kobayashi'?
Doesn't she live here?
My mother-in-law died two years ago.
What?
!
Is that so?
May i see that?
No, don't...
(Name of Deceased Kobayashi, Hideki)
I'm back.
You forgot your cell phone.
Huh?
It's at home... sorry.
Your father's dead.
Mine?
Yes.
What do you mean?
So i called the fishing port.
Our address was in his things.
But who cares now?
I haven't seen him in 30 years.
His girlfriend can tend to him.
They said he was single.
They're cremating him tomorrow.
His body's at the Fishermen's Co-op there.
He's not on our family register.
Tell them i can't sign for him.
Daigo!
Go.
No, it's fine.
Please!
I left... a son in Obihiro.
He was six.
I met someone.
'Mommy!
Mommy!
' my son was crying.
I pushed his little hands away and went running out.
And since then?
I'd love to see him, but i can't.
Why not?
You could go there.
Are parents who dump their kids... always like that?
!
Please!
You have to see him this one last time.
Daigo...
Sir...
Wait.
Take one.
It's fine.
I came in and he was dead.
It was a real shock.
He just turned up in town one day, all alone.
He worked so hard helping out at the harbor... that we let him live in the watchman's cottage.
I see...
He was real quiet, hardly said a word.
I'm glad someone from his family came.
The undertaker's on his way.
So that's your father...
I hate to say it but i don't remember... his face.
I wouldn't know him to see him.
(Hideki Kobayashi)
So what was his life for, anyway?
Living 70-some years and leaving one box of stuff?
In here.
All right?
'Scuse us.
Excuse us.
Can we get started?
Let's get him loaded.
Um...
Yes?
Could i do that?
No, no, we'll do it.
Offer him some water when we get him in.
One, two...
What the...?
!
My husband is a professional.
Dad...
Father...
Dad...

Winters didn't feel this cold when I was a child.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Please, this way!
Coming in!
My condolences!
We are here to assist you with encoffining.
May I light up the incense?
Yes.
Thank you for coming!
Looks like she's still alive.
Probably charcoal-burning suicide.
How can you tell?
The body is undamaged.
This is what happens when someone is discovered immediately after death in a cold car.
What a waste, she's beautiful.
Do you want to try?
Yes.
For the deceased's peaceful departure,
I will now commence the rite of encoffinment.
Everyone, please see her off from up close.
I will now begin the cleansing.
It has the thing.
What thing?
The thing.
What thing?
You know, the thing...
Err...
May I have a word with you?
Yes, what is it?
After the cleansing, we apply makeup on the deceased...
We have different makeups for male and female...
Oh... please wait.
Yes.
Sis, which makeup do you want for Tomeo?
Men's or girl's?
Come on, which one?
If I gave birth to a girl from the start, this would've never happened.
But thanks to someone's seed...
Girl's is fine then?
Yep.
Female's, please!
Yes.
Tomeo...
O K U R I B I T O
D E P A R T U R E S
Not many in the audience again today.
Yeah, they should put more effort into advertising.
I know.
Let's make a homepage for the orchestra.
My wife is a web designer.
I'll make her do it for free.
What do you think?
More importantly, are you going to be fine?
About what?
Next, the next.
Next what?
You spent so much money on that.
Got to start looking for the next one.
Good performance again, everyone!
Good work everyone!
Although the seats were empty...
I think your performances were great.
Um... actually today the owner of this orchestra, Mr. Sonezaki has something to tell you.
So, please give him your attention!
You're disbanded!
See ya!
I finally became an orchestra member.
But it became a past memory in a flash.
This cello is innocent.
Only because it was bought by a loser like me, it lost its job.
In many ways... this cello was too heavy for me.
Thank you very much!
Please cook it immediately.
Yes.
Good bye!
I'm home!
Welcome back!
She gave me an octopus.
I just happened to see our neighbor.
They just caught it this morning.
What's wrong?
Disbanded.
What is?
My orchestra.
I see...
You just have to find the next one.
There won't be a next one.
Someone with my skill level can only go so far... and there's the debt for this cello.
How much?
Don't worry, if it's just around 10,000 yen,
I can pay it back with my job.
180,000 yen.
1... 180,000 yen?
Pros all spend that much...
It's relatively cheap.
Why did you hide it from me?
I knew you'd be against it.
Why didn't you tell me about something so important?
I'm sorry.
I'll make dinner.
"All the cities around the world are our new homes.
Let's live together on a musical tour."
Those were the words of my marriage proposal.
But the reality is harsh.
No, I should've realized the limit to my talent a lot sooner.
What happened?
This octopus is alive!
You're right.
It's alive.
Hey, Dai... what should we do?
Don't get caught again.
Huh?
I think I'll quit.
Quit what?
Cello.
What will you do then?
Go back to the countryside...
in Yamagata.
I vote yes!
Huh?
You don't mind?
Well, the house your mom left you... we don't need to pay rent, right?
But you really don't mind?
Yes.
This is a wonderful instrument.
I thought it was the greatest turning point of my life, but for some reason, I felt relieved the instant I let go of the cello.
As if I was suddenly released from being tied up.
What I believed to be my dream... was probably not my real dream.
The only thing my mother left me, when she died two years ago.
I've been told my father ran the cafe at first, but I have almost no recollection of it.
After he left home for another woman, my mother ran this small cafe, and raised me alone.
Meal's ready.
Okay.
I thought you would hate the countryside more.
No, it's kind of refreshing.
I don't know if it's because of the water here, but the rice tastes better too.
Really?
Oh, maybe I'll start a shop.
What will you sell?
This is it!
This, this one!
No age limit, high salary?
In addition, short actual working time?
As a full-time employee!
"NK Agent"?
What kind of company is that?
"A job that helps out journeys."
A travel agency?
Oh, maybe tour guide?
It says "no experience necessary".
I'll go ask for details.
Yeah.
This is it.
Excuse me.
Is this "NK Agent"?
Yes...
I'm Kobayashi, I called earlier.
Oh, you're here for the interview!
The boss will be back soon, sit here.
Yes, thank you.
I... was against it when the boss wanted to post the ad in the newspaper.
Oh...
It's extremely hard to attract people into this industry.
Um... what does this company do?
What?
You came without knowing anything?
It said to help out with journeys...
Uh... that's not what you do?
Boss, he's here for the interview.
Nice to meet you, I'm Kobayashi.
I called you this morning.
Oh, it's you.
You seem more energetic than on the phone.
Thank you.
See?
It was a good idea.
Pour some tea.
Yes.
I brought my resume just in case.
Okay, sit down.
Thank you.
Can you put in lots of hours here?
Huh?
Uh... yes.
You're hired.
Eh?
What's your name again?
It's Kobayashi Daigo.
Order his business cards right away.
Got it.
W... wait...
We haven't discussed anything...
salaries and other things...
Oh, right.
Let's start with one hand.
"One hand"?
50,000 yen?
500,000 yen.
500,000 yen?
!
Too little?
Not at all, I can get that much?
I don't mind paying you in cash, daily.
No, wait, what kind of work will I...?
Let's see...
As my assistant at first.
Exactly what...?
To be exact encoffining.
Encoffining?
A job that places the corpse into the coffin.
It's starting to bloom!
Corpse as in dead people?
You ask funny questions.
No, uh, um...
The job posting said helping out journeys.
I assumed it was a travel agency...
Oh, this is a misprint.
Misprint?
Not "helping out journeys", it's...
"Helping out peaceful departure".
Departure?
So "NK" stands for "NouKan" (Encoffining).
Anyway, it must be some kind of fate.
Just give it a try.
You can quit if it doesn't suit you.
This is for today.
No, I can't...
Don't worry!
No...
I'm back.
Welcome back.
Here.
Where did you get this?
You said you wanted to eat sukiyaki from here, right?
Yonezawa-beef?
The highest-grade sirloin.
Wow!
Was it expensive?
I got paid in advance.
You got the job?
Kind of, yes.
Great!
Let's celebrate today.
Sure.
So, what kind of job was it?
Tour guide after all?
Not really...
Sales?
What's the matter?
It wasn't a travel agency.
Oh?
What was it?
Ceremonial event-related...
Like a wedding hall?
Yeah.
They might make you play the cello again!
I'll make sukiyaki right away.
Okay.
This is great!
Looks tasty.
I don't think I'll come back that late.
Get going!
Bye!
Morning!
Hello!
Use the boss' table until the new one arrives.
Your business cards are ready.
No misprints.
Are these that uncommon?
This is my first time seeing a real one.
First time?
Yes.
My grandparents passed away before I'd grown up, and my mother passed away while I was abroad.
She was already in her grave when I got back.
What about your father?
He left home for another woman when I was 6.
Your mother must have been lonely.
But...
I wonder if someone like me who has never even seen a dead body before... can really do this job?
You'll get used to it!
To dead bodies?
Yeah.
The weather is nice lately, so we're not very busy... but change of season...
Do you need help?
...will be very busy for us.
Where does work come from?
Funeral homes.
Funeral homes?
Yes.
Encoffining... used to be done by family members.
Eventually it was passed to funeral homes, then companies like ours appeared.
In short, it's a super-niche industry.
It's pretty heavy.
There are many kinds of coffins.
50000, 100000, 300000 yen.
They differ by that much?
The left one is plywood, the next one has metal fittings and carvings on both sides.
And the most expensive one is solid cypress wood.
Oh, the difference is in material and decoration.
Yes, they all burn the same way.
Same ashes.
The last shopping of your life is done by others.
Kind of ironic.
Right.
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Yes, he's here.
Yes, Minato Theater?
Immediately?
Okay.
Is that the boss?
A job.
A job?
Are you from NK?
Yes.
He's here.
Oh, there he is.
He's a newcomer to our company...
Kobayashi.
His name is Kobayashi, the model for today.
Good luck everyone!
Model?
We're going to film right after you finish changing.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Get changed and makeup over there.
Makeup?
Yes.
Boss...
Don't worry.
Go ahead.
Okay.
ENCOFFINING MANUAL
First apply cotton stuffing and cleansing...
Followed by...
The model is coming out!
Not bad.
Um... who's going to see this video?
Don't worry, it's a corporate DVD, so nobody will see it.
In encoffining, we first perform cotton stuffing and cleansing.
Cleansing symbolizes the ridding of this world's fatigue, pain, and lust... and also symbolizes the first bath for a new birth.
Traditionally, a washtub was used for cleansing, but for sanitary reasons, nowadays, we use sterilized cloths... to wipe... the body.
Clothing ritual is performed to maintain the dignity of the deceased.
Making sure the deceased's skin cannot be seen by the relatives... we perform it with utmost care.
After the preparation, we shave the face before applying makeup.
Males in particular experience shrinking of muscle and dry skin, it seems as if they have a long mustache, so we shave them thoroughly.
The skin of the dead gets damaged easier than you might think.
Sometimes the skin peels off just by touch.
Therefore, we perform it with caution and care...
Ow!
What the...
Ow, ow!
Uh, oh.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts!
Uh, oh...
Ow, ow!
Don't worry, don't worry.
It's not so bad.
Welcome home.
I'm home.
What is it?
What happened to your face?
My boss pushed me while I was shaving.
You were shaving at work?
Yeah.
You only use electric shavers at home...
I had no choice.
The boss ordered me to do it.
Don't worry, it's not so bad.
Weird company.
No kidding.
Weird...
Weird company.
The first job came without a warning.
Um... what should I do?
For today... you just have to watch.
Okay.
But man... we hit a bad one.
Huh?
What do you mean?
Never mind.
Well, you'll see.
Don't scare me like that!
Thank you for waiting.
Thanks for coming.
Where is the body?
An old lady living by herself...
dead for two weeks.
The body is badly deteriorated.
Be careful!
See you later.
Who is he?
From the funeral home.
Our employer.
Let's get started.
It stinks!
Ugh.
This way.
Eh?
Help out a little.
Yes.
Hold her feet.
Her feet!
Yes.
You said I only have to watch...
Slowly... gently...
Come on, hold them!
Yes.
Wait, wait...
You can go home for today.
It was a bit too intense for the first job.
Really?
Let's go today.
- Yeah sure!
Hey, did you eat something weird?
No.
Something smells.
Must be your scarf!
No way!
That guy wearing black, he smells!
Ah!
It's still here!
Leave it over there.
Yes.
300 yen.
Okay.
Thanks!
Towels for 100 yen.
Okay.
You can get a lot of money for this place right now.
I refuse to quit.
Leave already.
I just want the best for you.
You talk just like a civil servant!
I'm not so old that you need to worry about me!
Right?
Shiori?
Can I come for the big bath again?
Yes, of course!
For you, grandma will work hard!
Daigo...
Yamashita.
When did you come back?
You could've at least contacted me!
Sorry, I've been busy.
Oh!
You're Dai from Kobayashi's cafe.
Yes, it's been a long time.
It sure has been!
I hear you have an amazing job!
Huh?
Well... yes...
What is that instrument called?
Cello, that monster-sized violin.
Right, cello!
He's a great man.
He plays an instrument called cello in Tokyo!
Wow!
If only my son was as talented as he is!
Mom...
Sorry, we're having a little argument here.
Next time...
Sure, next time.
Bring your wife here next time.
You're married, right?
Yes.
This place is very peaceful without this fool.
Which fool gave birth to this fool?
Anyway, I have no intention of selling this place!
Oh, I got it!
Did you figure it out?
Yes, I finally figured it out.
Something happen at work?
No.
Let's eat!
Yeah.
Let's eat...
Our neighbor gave it to me.
Oh.
It was just slaughtered this morning, so it's really fresh!
She said we can even eat it raw!
Maybe we should wait a little longer.
Hey...
Are you ok?
Are you alright?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Dai, you're acting strange...
Hey, come on, Dai...
Hey, you're embarrassing me.
Not here...
Dai?
Hey, wait...
Mika...
Mika...
What exactly... am I being tested for?
Is this my punishment for not seeing my mother off?
What will happen to me?
Strangely, thinking about it made me want to play the cello.
I simply wanted to play the cello while reminiscing my past.
It's so small...
Salmons?
Ah, yes.
They're right by the rocks...
over there.
Oh!
Go for it!
It's kind of sad...
to climb only to die.
Why work so hard if you're going to die anyway?
I'm sure they want to go back... to their birthplace.
Let's go for lunch.
Lunch.
It's an order from your boss.
Is this a coincidence?
Huh?
That you happened to pass through here.
It's fate.
There's no such thing...
This is your god-given job.
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm sorry, sorry, I apologize.
They're angry!
Come on, Mr. Sasaki!
Sorry.
You're late.
It's 5 minutes past already!
I apologize.
You people make a living from the dead.
Brother...
Hurry up, damn it.
I sincerely apologize.
Is there a lipstick your wife liked to use?
What?
To revive a cold body, and grant eternal beauty.
It was calm and precise.
And more than anything, it was filled with affection.
To be present at the last farewell, and send off the deceased.
It was tranquil, and every action seemed elegant.
Thank you very much.
Please allow me to close the lid.
Naomi...
Naomi...
Excuse me...
I'm sorry about earlier today.
No, it's our fault.
Please take these.
Thank you.
That was... the most beautiful she's ever been.
Thank you so much.
It's nothing.
Welcome.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Ah!
Don't tell me...
Yes, she's my wife.
Wow!
Nice to meet you.
You've caught a pretty one!
It's not a big deal!
Take your time and warm up.
Yes, thank you.
Good evening.
Oh, hello.
Do you always come here?
I've been coming here for more than 50 years.
Oh!
Maybe I've seen you before...
Hot baths like this are pretty nice too.
They use groundwater heated by firewood.
The water feels soft.
That's why it doesn't sting even though it's hot.
I see.
It's the best bath house in Japan!
Right.
See you again, Tsuyako.
Thank you, come again.
Would you like me to help?
It's bad karma to get help from the customer!
You do everything by yourself?
Yes, my husband died a long time ago.
My son who works at a government office tells me I should sell this place, so they can build a condo here... but my current customers would be in a fix.
As long as I'm still healthy...
Come on, you're still young.
Give him your support.
What?
Dai is too kind.
He keeps everything to himself.
When his parents split up too...
He never cried in front of his mother.
He cried when he was alone in the bath.
So hard his shoulders shook from crying.
He's like that sometimes.
Please be understanding.
Yes.
How's the water today?
Hmm... so-so.
Oh, shush!
That's great.
It looks good on you.
It's all white!
It's going to get cold starting tomorrow!
Give it to me.
Thanks.
Hey, wanna go for a drink?
Oh, right!
I know a nice bar.
Really?
Let's go!
(With dialect) "Let's go".
Let's go?
Let's go.
Let's go!
It's good!
It's been a long time since we've drunk together like this.
It's like a scene from an enka (traditional Japanese song).
Your mother listened to this kind of music?
They must all be my father's.
Oh, right.
It started out as your father's cafe.
I don't even want to think about him.
Actually, I don't even remember his face.
Don't you want to see him?
Nope.
But... if I did...
If you met him?
I'd knock him out.
It's my father's favorite.
I think... your mom loved your dad the whole time.
No way.
Otherwise she would've thrown out all the records.
She wouldn't have sorted them.
Yes?
I want you to go right away.
What?
Now?
Yes, someone hung himself in the Star Hotel by the station.
What about the boss?
He just left for another client.
Please go by yourself today.
Okay?
Okay.
Have a good day!
Thanks!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Thanks for last night!
The police officer was impressed.
Because of your young age.
I gave it everything I've got.
I see.
It's really cold today.
Yeah.
Here.
Thank you!
Bloodshot eyes!
Didn't get any sleep?
This job is mentally draining.
How did you end up in this job, Ms. Uemura?
Thanks for the tea.
A lot happened when I was young.
I couldn't stay over there...
Where?
Hokkaido.
None of my past jobs lasted.
I just happened to end up in a cafe in this town.
But the owner had a cerebral hemorrhage... and died all of a sudden!
Then, our boss came...
That was when I witnessed encoffining for the first time.
Made me think... when I die, I want this person to do it for me.
He's completely different from others.
That's how I ended up here.
Fate plays funny tricks on people.
Never know what'll happen.
You're right.
Tastes great.
Hey, Yamashita.
Is he a friend of yours?
Good afternoon!
Good afternoon!
You don't have to greet him.
Honey...
Go on.
I'll catch up.
There's a rumor going around.
About what?
It's none of my business, but find a proper job!
Let's go!
Come!
I'm home.
Mika?
Mika...
What's wrong?
...make sure the relatives cannot see the cotton stuffing taking place...
At times, we may need to stuff the anus as well.
Roll up the cotton like this, and... push in all the way inside the anus to prevent an outflow of body fluid.
What's this?
You looked through my desk without my permission?
That's not the issue.
I just happened to be a model for this...
I found out about your job too.
So... what?
Why didn't you tell me?
You would've been against it...
Of course!
Doing this kind of job... aren't you ashamed of it?
Why should I be?
Because I touch dead people every day?
I just want you to have a normal job.
What's normal?
Everyone dies.
I'll eventually die, and so will you.
Death itself is normal.
I don't care about the philosophy of it!
Just quit the job now.
Please.
I've never complained until now.
When you wanted to quit the cello... and when you said you wanted to come back to the countryside...
I followed you with a smile.
Of course, I was actually sad.
But... because I love you...
So please... just this once,
do what I ask.
And if I said no?
Can you work in this job for rest of your life?
I'm going back to my parent's home.
Come and get me after you quit your job.
Mika...
Don't touch me!
Filthy!
It's wrong.
Huh?
My daughter didn't look like this.
Her hair color is wrong... it's all wrong!
That's what she looks like!
What are you doing?
!
It's all wrong.
Redo it.
Yes.
Why are you saying this now?
This only happened... because you didn't raise her properly!
You don't have to say it like that.
What did you say?
You also never paid any attention to her.
Who the hell do you think you are?
You got her on the damn bike, and you ended up surviving!
Aren't you ashamed?
Stop.
Stop, stop.
It's you!
Leave.
It doesn't change the fact that it's your fault Miyuki died.
Can you make up for it?
Huh?
Can you take that guy's job for the rest of your life and make up for it?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
The boss will be sad to hear that.
What?
He really liked you.
He did?
Yeah!
You're our first ever employee!
The interview was very simple despite that.
He always acts on his instincts!
He said he felt something in you.
But still...
Sorry, but please talk to him in person if you want to quit.
He's upstairs.
Excuse me.
Come on in.
Okay.
What have you been eating?
What?
Your wife hasn't come back yet, right?
Yes...
Eat here.
It's probably better than your wife's cooking.
Let's eat.
What's this?
Blowfish milt.
It's best grilled, with salt.
That's my wife.
Passed away 9 years ago.
All married couples are eventually separated by a death, but it's tough being the one left behind.
I dressed her up, and sent her away.
My very first client.
I've been working in this business ever since.
This too...
This is a corpse too.
The living eat the living to live.
Right?
These plants are an exception.
You have to eat if you don't want to die.
If you're going to eat, might as well taste good.
Tasty, isn't it?
It sure is.
Yeah it is... sadly.
It's almost two weeks since I returned to Yamagata from Tokyo.
Now that I think of it, I've lead such an unremarkable life.
Will I really be able to make a living with this job?
Do you want to try?
Yes.
Slowly, lower from the head.
Tomeo...
Good bye.
Thank you.
We've been doing nothing but argue since Tomeo started dressing up like that...
I haven't looked straight into his face for a long time.
But... seeing him smile made me think... ah... he really is my child.
Even if he looks like a girl... he really is my child!
Thank you so much!
Tastes great!
Is it tasty?
...Sadly.
Did you bring the cello?
Really?
I want to hear!
I'll play a little bit.
It's my first time listening to a cello live.
You were in an orchestra too, right?
Yes, but it went out of business right away.
How long have you been playing?
Ever since I was in kindergarten.
Wow, for that long?
This is also a children's cello... my father forced me to learn to play this.
Your father had a fine taste.
He's the worst father ever.
He ran a small cafe, but he ran away with a waitress, never came back.
He really was the worst father ever.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Who knows, probably already dead.
Well, what should I play?
Let's see... something Christmassy.
Yeah.
Uh... will different religions bother you?
Don't worry.
Buddhism, Christian, Islam, Hindu... we handle all religions here.
Then, for the Holy Night...
Yes, this is NK Agent.
Thank you always for your business.
Yes, tomorrow.
The name of the deceased is...
I will now prepare her for her last journey.
Gently cover her toes...
Um...
My grandma said she wanted to wear loose socks.
Okay.
Grandma,
bye-bye.
Thank you for everything, grandma.
...in the name of Jesus Christ...
Amen.
Boss has aged a lot!
Thank you, honey.
Mika!
You haven't been cleaning this place?
Occasionally.
You're lying, you haven't even cleaned once.
I cleaned twice.
That's not "occasionally".
You're a mess without me, as I thought.
I have something to report too.
What is it?
I'm pregnant.
Wow...
I'm going to be a father?
So please start getting your life together.
Can you proudly tell your child about your job?
I'm sure it'll lead to bullying.
I don't care about money.
Let's just live happily together.
Yes, hello?
What?
Now?
What?
!
Okay.
I'll be there right away.
You're going to work at a time like this?
Lady at the bath house... passed away.
She's my wife, Mika.
She collapsed while carrying firewood... and passed away.
She was working 'til the very end.
It'll be lonely around here, without this bath house.
Please wipe her face one by one, and bid her farewell one last time.
Mom...
Mother...
Shiori.
This is good-bye to your grandma.
Mother...
Thank you for everything.
This is where you work?
Everyone, please see her off with a prayer.
Please allow me to close the 'window'.
Thank you... see you again.
Can I witness the last moment of my mother?
Thank you.
I guess people get a hunch about these things.
Last winter, the two of us had a little Christmas party.
I didn't expect her to celebrate it at this age.
But... she said she wanted to have one no matter what.
We bought a small cake, lit up the candles... and celebrated together.
Then, out of the blue... she asked me to help her with the firewood.
This must have been what she meant.
I'm good at burning things.
Working here for a long time makes me think... that death... is a gateway.
Death doesn't mean the end, but leaving the present, heading for the next stage.
Truly a gateway.
As a gatekeeper,
I've seen off many people.
"Have a nice trip, see you again", I would say...
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
I'm sorry.
Mom...
I'm sorry, mom.
What are you doing?
This is it!
Here.
What?
Stone-letter.
"Stone-letter"?
In the ancient times, before humans invented writing... they searched for the stone that resembled their feelings, and gave it to another person.
The person who received the stone, read the other person's feelings by the weight and texture.
For example, smooth texture symbolizing a peaceful mind, and rough texture symbolizing a concern for others.
Thank you!
What did you feel?
It's a secret.
That's a wonderful story.
Who did you hear it from?
My old man.
Does that mean... that big stone too?
Yes, I got it from my father.
I never knew.
"Let's give each other stone-letters every year", he said... yet that was the only time.
Such a lousy father!
Can you play every day for the unborn baby?
Sure.
What nice weather.
Good afternoon.
Is this the Kobayashi residence?
Yes.
A telegram for Ms. Kazuko.
What...?
Is she no longer here?
No, uh... my mother-in-law passed away two years ago.
Really?
Oh...
Excuse me, can I see it?
You're not supposed to...
KOBAYASHI HIDEKI Death day and time: 18th, around 7:30
Please come and collect his body!
I'm back, sorry for taking so long.
Daigo, you forgot to take your cell phone.
What?
Oh... it's back home.
Sorry.
Father passed away.
Whose?
Yours.
What do you mean?
... is what they told me when I called the Yurahama Fishing Association.
Our address was in his belongings.
But I don't even know him...
I haven't seen him in more than 30 years!
And the person he ran away with can take care of him.
It seems he was alone the whole time.
He'll be cremated tomorrow morning.
It seems his body is in their assembly hall.
Anyway, we're no longer legally related... tell them I can't sign the documents.
Thanks.
Dai...
Please go for him.
Don't worry about it.
Please, I'm begging you.
I... abandoned my son in Hokkaido.
He was 6 years old.
I fell in love with someone...
"Mommy, mommy"... he cried, but...
I shook off his small arm, and left home.
Your son...
Of course I want to see him, but...
I can't.
Why not?
Just go see him if you want to.
Do all parents who've abandoned their child act like that?
Then you're all too irresponsible!
Please, go for him.
Go and see his last appearance.
Dai...
Boss...
Hey...
Take one you like.
Go ahead.
He was already dead when I showed up this morning.
I was surprised.
I don't know where he came from, but he came to this town by himself.
He worked very hard at the port.
So I let him live in this shack.
I see...
He was a quiet man...
I'm glad someone from his family showed up.
People from the funeral home will be here soon.
Okay.
He's your father.
I'm ashamed to admit...
I don't recognize... his face.
That he looked like this...
It doesn't even ring a bell.
What was this man's life?
He lived for 70-odd years...
Only to leave a cardboard box behind.
He's here.
Thanks.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Can I take him now?
Let's just toss him in.
Yeah.
Um...
Yes?
May I?
No, we can do it.
Just give him a drink after we place him into the coffin.
Ready...
What are you doing?
My husband is... an encoffiner.
Father...
He's my father.
Father...

TAKITA YOJIRO
A film by T A K I T A Y O J I R O
Phil Donahue:
We're talking about swinging, two couples who swing.
Larry Levenson is here.
He's owner of Plato's Retreat in New York City, an actual commercial establishment where people can go and swing.
Some of the tenets of swingers include the separation of-- what they say is the separation of sex and love.
We promote social intercourse and sexual intercourse.
Whatever you want to do, you can do.
( audience groans )
- Aren't you illegal?
- No.
No way.
Sex is not illegal anyplace in New York.
But I couldn't open a cathouse, could I?
- Well, that's paid sex.
- ( audience groans )
( disco playing )
( crowd rioting )
John Leo:
The '70s were a transitional period.
It was when the ethic of the '60s took hold.
Newscaster:
1500 cops are injured.
Woman:
People were complaining New York had become a pit of vice.
Anthony Haden-Guest:
That contributed to disco and Plato's also played its part in suddenly turning things around in New York and making New York what it was-- the most exciting city in the world.
( disco music continues )
- # you make me feel... # - it was a party town.
1977 in New York was a fabulous year.
Sexuality was in the air.
Haden-Guest:
Everybody was immensely curious.
Lots and lots of heteros would go to the gay clubs just to look at the glory holes.
And lots of people who were not remotely exhibitionistic would go to Plato's.
Swing couples went there to swap.
You try my wife and I'll try your wife.
Forget about the sex.
You could wander around.
You could actually swim.
You could eat this free third-rate buffet... which I always considered tempting, but dangerous.
They had dancing.
They had a show.
Dan Dorfman:
I thought to myself, "this really can't be real.
Maybe I'm watching a dirty movie."
But it was a dirty movie that really came to life.
Friends of mine said that they went there by looking at it on cable television.
I was never in Plato's Retreat.
I have no idea if they in fact took off-- other than clothing.
10 years earlier everyone was rolling around naked in Woodstock, you know, and smoking pot and screwing their brains out, you know, in the meadows.
So this was just an indoor version that was accessible to New Yorkers.
I am Larry's sister.
We were five years apart.
We were very very close and we grew up as best friends.
My parents had a very conventional lifestyle and marriage.
My father was a hard-working man.
He was in the kosher meat business.
Oldest memories of Larry are as a... smiling young man, didn't really love the academic pursuits.
When I first met Larry, he had just gotten out of the service.
He had told me that his father had a butcher shop and he was a wholesale distributer of briskets.
And he would work nights.
And I really feel that some of the times that he said he was working, he wasn't working.
When he first married Gloria, I don't think any of us thought that it wouldn't last because we didn't know anybody who had separated or divorced.
I thought he was cheating on me.
Danny Levenson:
My dad and my mom got divorced when I was six.
So my dad really wasn't around a lot.
My parents separated when I was very young.
So my first recollection actually is when my dad used to work at McDonald's and he brought me the hamburglar-- it was a little stuffed hamburglar.
So that's what I used to sleep with-
- I used to sleep with a little hamburglar.
All I can remember is through those years, my mother yelling at my father on the phone, "they're waiting for you.
You didn't show up.
You said you were coming."
And of course every business that Larry was in was on the weekends.
So the times when fathers would be with their children,
Larry was either off selling sodas on the beach or preparing for swingers parties, wherever they might be held.
I was very surprised when Larry was involved in that kind of lifestyle.
I really didn't think that it was something that would be his thing to do.
But maybe I just didn't know him that well.
# what's our favorite evening game?
# # night baseball?
# # oh, baby, you're all wet # # let's swap partners is the name # # suburban roulette... #
You know what I don't like to see is this thing about you have to be monogamous.
I say nobody's monogamous.
And if you make somebody say that you're fucking monogamous and you're gonna be legitimate,
"I married her.
I'm never gonna fuck," I'm a liar.
The swinging movement was very small and very secret.
We all have jobs and we all pay mortgages.
Just because we consider ourselves swingers, we're not freaks of nature.
# I love your sister # # tomorrow night... #
At a swing party, you can go, you can find-- meet other people that maybe can meet some of your sexual needs that maybe your spouse can't.
And yet you don't have to go out and cheat.
Swinging is a situation where a man and a woman, part of their sex life is to find other couples or other people that have similar interests, that they like socially, they like to be with, but in particular they want to have sex with.
# suburban roulette... # # suburban roulette!
#
The meeting area was usually a bar that they took over for Friday, Saturday night.
I worked as a waitress and some guys used to come in and they brought in "screw" magazine and I brought it home and I showed it to Charlie.
- And that's all it took.
- And there were all kinds of ads in it.
- And we started to think about it.
- Get interested.
It was interesting.
( Bass music thumping )
It was a place for them to dance, have a drink, meet each other.
I remember it looked more like a Bar Mitzvah.
# hey, little girl, get your dancing shoes # # gold satin jacket... #
I don't know anybody's last name in any of these places.
And yet you can go home with them, make love to them, spend the weekend with them, kiss them goodbye--
"see you next week, John, Mary.
Bye-bye."
And that's the end of it and you're best friends for life.
Steve:
People would be handing out slips that say,
"okay, there's a party on the east side tonight."
The only problem is when you're stoned, and I said, "Now I gotta go to Queens?"
# the roller coaster gotta make the most # # and dance dance dance... #
I met Larry Levenson at a party back in the mid-'70s in Coney Island, Brooklyn.
And he started arranging some organized swing parties.
He liked the idea of being able to have that scene out in the open the way gay bars did.
It was a one-man band at the beginning.
It was just him and Mary and maybe a couple of other people.
Mary made all the phone calls.
Mary did a lot of the footwork.
Mary was actually responsible for putting together the logo of Plato's.
The backward twos was Mary's idea.
I'm going to ask you one of my favorite indiscreet questions.
How did you and Larry meet?
Now come on, the truth now.
Well, I had come with another young man to Plato's in its first location.
And I fell in love with him on the spot.
# when I get home, babe... #
Dian Hanson:
Mary and Larry were swingers
And they started the club together.
And it seemed like a perfect idea and a way to be close.
So it was a family thing.
# I wanna kiss you all over... #
Reporter:
What did he say?
Do you remember?
- ( giggles )
- Out with it!
I was on my way to the ladies' room and he told me to come on in the water.
And I told him I couldn't right then because I was on my way to the ladies' room.
And he said, "come on in.
The water's nice and warm and that's how it got that way."
That's it, that's Larry-- Mr. Taste.
- You got to know Mary better than me...
- Yes.
...Physically and mentally.
( laughs )
That might have been your first female, I think.
Really, huh?
- No.
- No?
It mushroomed from there.
Got ahold of a hotel-- this hotel basement pool area.
Yeah, so this call came in from somebody--
I don't remember who it is anymore, some friend or acquaintance and said, "there's this live sex club where people are having sex in front of everybody."
And I said, "you mean a gay bar?"
and they said, "no no, these are straight people."
# am I dreaming # # that you're with me?
#
- # am I dreaming... #
- Steve:
Plato's was always for couples only.
And of course we always invited single ladies.
It was a tacky little place.
And sitting behind there is this guy Larry-- who I later learned is Larry Levenson.
He seemed in charge and he's sitting there in a towel, and that's it.
One of the best parts of it for me was that it was relaxed in the sense that people were coming and not necessarily doing anything.
Not even necessarily taking their clothes off.
Two of the men... were wearing no clothes except for black socks and shoes.
And walking around that way, kinda like that stag-film look.
So I wrote it up.
I played it pretty big.
And a few days later I went there-- went back.
# one thing I feel that I like... #
Plato's was a simple name.
It's the only one I could spell actually.
So we used Plato's.
Then after that I found out that Plato's was gay, but it was too late.
The lines were just unbelievable.
I mean we went from, what?
30, 40 couples or people to 400!
Now you have a lot of people that don't know the old crowd.
There were people that used to come to Plato's that to most people-- would say were not the most physically appealing, but they were the nicest people you'd ever want to meet in the world.
They were walking around with the black socks and the shoes, and this new group were just naked and much wilder.
People say, "hey, you got a date?
You want a night out?" et cetera, et cetera.
"You and your date, you got a date that's sort of on the wild side?"
Personally I think that with a little encouragement everybody's on the wild side.
All of a sudden he really was on a runaway tiger-- of sex.
- It was like a big party.
- There was literally lines around the block.
Charlie:
They were just coming down and in and taking over and dancing and holding hands, and hugging.
It was a sight.
Freaked me out.
I didn't know.
Steve:
Plato's was becoming big.
We needed a big place.
We needed a special place.
He contacted a couple of good friends of his which I also knew:
Frank Pernice,
Frankie-- he was some sort of caterer.
Frank came home one day and said,
"what a great idea.
This has to be fantastic."
About a week or two weeks later, we met Hy Gordon there.
Could be dangerous.
They were gentlemen.
They were the type of people that they didn't have to throw their weight around, if you understand what I mean.
Why Larry had to hook up with these people--
I can't tell.
I don't know.
Frankie used to say that Larry had a grocery store and he turned it into a supermarket.
Captain John:
He ended up renting the Ansonia Hotel.
Charlie:
It was actually a gay...
- bathhouse.
- ...bathhouse.
In fact Bette Midler sang there.
And what's-his-name.
- The piano player-- Barry Manilow.
- Barry Manilow.
# Tootsie roll soul and doodle-white shoes... #
Woman:
When I first heard about Plato's, all my ideas and everything I had heard about Plato's basically was wrong.
I thought that I would walk through the door and trip over a lot of fucking bodies in the middle of the floor.
And it just doesn't happen that way.
It was a dark door, just a rope outside.
It had a long stairway going down.
And I think the admissions people were at the top of the stairway.
Walking into Plato's is not necessarily an event in itself.
Just being there is the event.
Plato's Retreat is not a sex club, it's a swing club for free-thinking free-living adult couples.
It's a club with everything disco, everything included, with sex available if couples want it.
Bacho:
I asked, "what the fuck is it?"
You know?
There's like 20 mattresses laid together.
It was a dance floor.
Then you had the dance floor in front of me.
Most everyone was walking around naked.
As I said, at first we wrapped our towels around us when we first walked out, but then when we saw the atmosphere of everybody very free, laughing, kissing, and really without their towels, we figured what the heck.
Bryce Britton:
I don't know, it was just kind of like a bathhouse locker room.
But I do think that there was
A lot of, like, coaching going on, at least with the women and encouragement, and a feeling of sisterhood like we're all in this together.
There was just lots of lonely people looking to meet other people.
Sex was part of the game, but it wasn't the whole game.
Nobody made fun of you.
Nobody said, "ugh!" you know?
How you look, how you look disgusting or whatever--
Any inhibitions you had you got over.
And you didn't have them anymore.
# I can see you coming a mile away... #
And you had a jacuzzi.
Al Goldstein:
Anyone who went into the jacuzzi was insane
Because I think there was every kind of bacteria.
It was chemical warfare.
We played ping-pong.
We went swimming.
Abigail:
People have a sense of being cleansed in a pool.
This was a naughty pool.
Jacqueline:
Guys were floating on the top of the water
And their penises were sticking up and it looked like periscopes.
( laughs )
I had just come from Paris so I was a young photographer, and kind of a shy girl from Ohio.
So I-
- I--
I disrobed...
And I plunge into the pool.
And I'm swimming.
I, like, go.
I sort of underwatered the whole length of the pool.
And when I come up, I see all these men standing around the pool
And they're all jerking off.
And their come is, like, coming in an arc across the pool over my head.
It was just amazing.
That was one of my biggest regrets-- was that I didn't get that picture.
- You go there, right?
- Definitely, yes.
- There's a membership fee?
How much is it?
- Right.
It cost $25 per couple.
Now for that, you get a meal that was fantastic, like you get at any Bar Mitzvah, a full smorgasbord.
Chicken, ribs, chow mein, lasagna, meatballs.
- Spaghetti.
- No, lasagna.
- Oh, okay.
- Potato salad, macaroni.
- Cold cuts.
- Coleslaw.
- Cold cuts.
- Cold cuts.
- Did I say chicken?
- Yeah.
Why are you asking about that horrible food?
Jesus.
Which, by the way, Larry thought was wonderful.
Larry really thought that was wonderful.
He was so proud of his buffet.
But the buffet was disgusting.
There was people-- oral sex this and that--
All crazy sex things.
So we left there.
I said I want to go to the room and eat my sandwich.
So we went to another room-- I guess the pool table-- and they were having sex on the pool table.
We used to go buy pizza for ourselves and it was real good pizza and we said to Larry,
- "it would be nice after the food's almost gone"-- - just to break it up.
- About 1:00 in the morning.
- When you start running out of food and people come out of the orgy or they're dancing, swimming-- you feel like grabbing something.
They're tired of a bologna sandwich.
I said, "Hey, why don't you order 10 pies?"
"Why not?"
- Woman:
You weren't hiding, were you?
- No.
- Did you meet a nice girl?
- No.
Leo:
Everything was open except these few black cubicles.
That you could have private sex if you felt embarrassed to be doing it in front of the Japanese tourists.
Don:
You could hear conversations in the room to the right of you, on the left of you.
You'd hear women trying to figure out who was going to carpool to Hebrew School in the morning.
We spent some very very happy hours controlling our hysteria so that people inside wouldn't know that we were listening to the kind of forced dialogue between people who have just met in an orgy room.
It was good stuff.
I wish I'd recorded some of it.
When Larry showed me into this closed Cubicle and the woman in there was his wife Mary, he seemed almost excited to be able to introduce Mary to the press:
"Hi, Mary, how are you?
This is John Leo."
And again it was almost the enthusiasm of a Kiwanis executive showing off his home town.
- Larry:
Whyrepressyourdesires?
- Donahue:
What?
- Why repress your desires?
- I'd like to be in the Indianapolis 500 too, but I have the common sense not to engage in it because it's not good for me.
( applause )
And that's just what he said-- "it's not good for everybody."
So for you, it wouldn't be good.
The mattress room was the most intense.
And for people who found Plato's really uncomfortable in terms of almost morally, that was the toughest place to go and look.
You would have maybe 200 bodies in there on a busy night and just writhing together like a bucket of worms.
# love today, cry tomorrow # # who's to say # # life is gay... #
- Abigail: "look at that guy's-- he's not really handsome, but look what he's got.
And look what she's got and where is that going?"
It was real and your ears could hear it was real.
Someone-- ( moans ) the breathing and even the smell and the sweat and the-- ugh.
It exhilarated me and at the same time it sort of depressed me.
Because it completely kills your notions about romance.
Like a dance floor, sometimes people are just dancing.
But sometimes there's a groove-- a tribal groove that people get in and be in incredible synch and there would be a lot of energy and it was like that with the mattress room.
I was terrified of the matt room.
( moaning )
And you'd fuck a little and you watch a little and hang out, fuck a little more.
# danger in the shape of something wild #
# stranger dressed in black, she's a hungry child... #
( heart beating )
( panting )
Dorfman:
Bacho the disc jockey, he told me, "you're a reporter, right?"
He says, "watch!" he played the music.
He'd speed up the music and the things would go faster.
He slowed down the music and the things would go slower.
It was unbelievable.
You had to be there to see that.
Fast and slow lovemaking.
Ferrato:
Ejaculation juices were everywhere.
So I'm sitting on a lot of these wet cushions.
And then on one of these nights I go home and I start feeling really itchy.
"Oooh, what's that?
What is that?"
And then I looked down and I see all these crabs were in there and I just got a big dose of it.
You know, because that's where crabs breed is in all those damp, moist... nether places.
I mean, I just remember a lot of this-- you know, in the mattress room.
# hot child in the city. #
What made you organize-- originate Plato's Retreat,
A place for swinging couples?
- What is the swinging movement?
- It's a couples' movement.
Couples that want to be free-thinking, free-living adult couples.
They don't believe in monogamous relationships.
They would rather get involved with other people but together with their spouses instead of cheating with them.
# I was born with a smile on my face # # the whole of my life's been a pantomime... #
Leo:
Larry had the pitch and tone of a missionary.
He thought he was the future and he was pulling back the curtain on something wholesome and happy.
I only actually met him once, and I was unable to shake his hand because just before he extended it, he was doing something with it that would tend to make you want to stay several yards away.
# born with a smile on my face... #
Hanson:
Larry said, "I fall in love with every woman
I have sex with, even if I have sex with 10 women a night."
And Larry could have sex with 10 women a night.
He was phenomenal that way.
He said, "It's always romance, it's always exciting and I'm always grateful."
# to have your leisure give you pleasure... #
The thing I mostly remember is he had these giant teeth.
He had really huge teeth.
There's a yiddish word-- hamisch-- and that's what he was.
He was like your nicest uncle.
- A Hugh Hefner.
- A maitre d'.
Larry was... no question a trailblazer.
He was a pioneer in his field.
Quite the guy.
Whether you were in the business, whether you were rich, whatever, Larry always had time for you... especially if you had a great-looking wife.
I think he was lonely.
I think he loved attention.
He loved having people around him, you know?
And he loved being, I guess, you know, the guy with-- the kid with the-- with the baseball bat.
It was his glove, his bat, his ball, you know?
Hi there.
It's Larry and Mary again to tell you about Plato's Retreat, the first and only couples' club of its kind anywhere.
Yes, there's a full-length swimming pool and outrageous whirlpool which holds about 30 people at a time, disco dancing with a live DJ.
I grew up in the upper-middleclass Jewish Catskills of the Concord Hotel.
I was Miss Concord Hotel at 16.
And it seemed to me that all of those people had children, and all those children moved to Long Island, and Southern Jersey.
And all of them went to Plato's.
# when I wake up # # in the morning light... #
Ferrato:
The crowd at Plato's was conventional.
Abigail:
It wasn't filled with my friends, but it did a great job in some ways because it sort of liberated Long Island.
It liberated New Jersey.
Haden-Guest:
I never saw a velvet-rope type situation there.
I don't think there might have been a velvet rope.
I never saw an eager crowd waiting to get in with bouncers keeping them out.
Everything at Plato's, even the ugly person--
I don't think there were any-- was-- was-- had a certain charm.
- It was a poor man's playboy mansion.
- Absolutely.
Matuschka:
I actually admire people that are that free that could go into a place like that and just let it all hang out, take all their clothes off and walk around-- including those fat people that look like they've got, you know,
double sets of twins in their belly.
I'm amazed that they can do that because even though
I looked a lot different then-- I was skinnier and I had two breasts-- I couldn't take my clothes off in front of strangers.
I mean, I think it takes a lot of something to be able to do that.
# I'll meet ya in the usual place...#
Dorfman:
I thought they had resuscitated the orgy
For the man in the street, which is exactly what they did.
You pay whatever it is-- 20, 25 bucks--
You get in and you can join in an orgy.
Where can you do that in the United States?
You could do it at Plato's.
My friends were very... you know, backwards.
And I-
- I grew away from my friends.
I grew away.
I went to the city.
I went to bars.
I went up on Second Avenue, First Avenue, up to Uptown.
I wanted to meet a more educated crowd.
I was no boy scout.
I was a wild guy,
Very uninhibited.
I was a model.
The first time I heard about Plato's Retreat was I went to Club Med at Martinique with a friend of mine and this guy was telling me, "Miles, you're gonna love this place.
It's wild.
Everyone's having sex all over the place."
My boyfriend was a minister.
and he asked me to go to Plato's Retreat that night
And we went.
I was a tingling mess of hormones.
I was like-- almost like when you're a teenager.
Miles:
As soon as I walked down the stairs, a little redheaded girl comes up to me, really pretty, grabs me by the arm and says, "Come here.
Come with me."
Betsy:
At first we talked to each other for a little bit.
And, um, you know, he was obviously more comfortable there than I was.
We go right into a little private room.
You'll love that.
We're in Plato's Retreat, where everyone's having sex all over the place, there are little rooms called "for the inhibited."
Everybody was so nice to me.
Everybody made you feel at home.
I had a chance to... look around a little bit.
And somewhere in there he disappeared.
And I found myself with a construction worker from Connecticut.
# at Plato's Retreat # # you can make your dreams come true # # fulfill your wildest fantasies # # we've got them all for you... #
She was nuts, absolutely wild.
She goes, "Oooh, pussy loves cock.
Pussy loves cock."
Unbelievable-- a maniac.
I said, "this is my kind of place."
# the pleasure and the fun # # will keep you feeling young # # it's for you # # it's for you... #
I was a young good-looking kid, I guess, and several girls came on to me and their boyfriends weren't that attractive.
and if you had to go with one-- you had to trade off.
( laughs )
And she yelled at me, she screamed at me, and I said, "Just do it!
Just do it."
You know?
And... we didn't talk much after that.
# the pleasure and the fun # # will keep you feeling young # # it's for you # # it's for you... #
He was a wonderful lover.
And I said to myself, "People who come to Plato's Retreat must be pretty good lovers," because this man had been.
Um... # it's for you!
#
I wanted to tell the people I grew up with, like, no, I came from a neighborhood in Queens, New York.
But you couldn't tell-- you couldn't talk about that kind of thing with guys from the neighborhood because they wouldn't believe you.
To be honest, it was going out on an edge for me.
It was a very edgy thing to do to... you know, spend an evening in Plato's Retreat.
There was this attractive mulatto woman going down on her man with her ass up in the air.
I sat down on the mattress next to her and started stroking her.
No opposition, so I--
I guess, you know, stuck my cock in her pussy and screwed her.
And she didn't even look back.
She was too busy blowing her boyfriend.
I hope I'm not being too vulgar.
The minister and I... did hook up sometime during that evening.
But I don't remember when.
- Which is telling.
- Larry:
Phil?
Yeah-- yes, Larry Levenson, Plato's Retreat.
I can speak for Plato's and we get about 50% new couples every night.
We have disco dancing-- in fact we have a song about Plato's Retreat that's number six in the country right now.
Abigail:
I met people years later who said things like,
"oh, I went in there.
I went to Plato's."
I went to Plato's, you know?
It became part of the memoir.
You know?
That was exciting in itself.
We had judges, lawyers, police--
- Senators.
- Senators.
Ferrato:
Robin Leach who was...
He was there just to look.
Students met their professors, guys met their ex-wives, future wives.
Sammy Davis, JR.
on the dance floor at Plato's Retreat, it was a treat.
They'd tell me this guy was a big star--
Frank Sinatra's friend, you know.
- Althea, his wife...
- Althea, his wife.
...pulled her shirt up.
Oh, man, how could I forget his name?
He's a writer-- Hugh Hefner's friend, he committed suicide...
Jerzy Kosinski.
Much of the cast of "Saturday Night Live."
What's his name?
Dreyf-
- Richard Dreyfuss.
He never came down with a lady.
Again he was invited to stay.
Hanson:
Dan Pastorini was having a big year with the Houston Oilers.
And the men recognize him.
And the men started, "It's Dan Pastorini!
It's Dan Pastorini!"
And just immediately grabbing their wives and just-- you know,
"fuck Dan Pastorini!"
Reporter:
Why did you decide in early 1973 to go underground?
There was no way that I could possibly get a fair trial.
Smith:
Abbie Hoffman was underground, running from the FBI, basically.
And one of these times I got a phone call from him saying, "I'm in town.
And I've been reading all about Plato's in your column in the 'Voice' and I want to go to Plato's Retreat."
And I said, "are you out of your mind?"
( slurring ) This is where we're working on the new constitution.
- ( giggles )
- Smith:
And he said, "no no no, Igottago .
Igottago.
I gotta go there.
I gotta see it.
I can't miss this."
He comes over after awhile and he says,
"Can't I tell them who I am?
I mean, they-- they-- they just walk away from me.
I thought you said everybody gets laid here."
I said, "go ahead, but I think it's really dangerous."
Abbie was one of the first people that I knew that couldn't get laid at Plato's.
I probably wouldn't have gone as many times as I did, but friends from California kept asking me to walk them in.
I was wondering, do you get a lot of curiosity seekers, people that just like to go and watch?
- Man:
Yes, voyeurs, definitely.
- Like me.
Yes, there's no pressure, there's no obligation and no commitment to do anything at our club.
And I'm positive it's the same way at Larry's club.
Woman:
I come for... sex, good conversation, intellect.
Michael:
The only rule, actually, in the entire club was no.
If somebody said no, that was it.
But if they allowed it, anything went.
Females first.
They set the rule.
If they want to be touched, that's fine.
They don't want to be touched, they're not gonna be touched.
If she wants to walk around with her top off... she walks around with her top off.
That was it.
I think at Plato's it was kind of interesting that women were really in a position to be assertive, to approach men for sex, to kind of try out a lot of the things that we had been on the receiving end of.
It was yummy.
Why let them have all the pleasure?
Why even pretend that you didn't feel good about it and you didn't have a good time when you were sexually involved?
Dodson:
The whole thing with Plato's is that you would walk into this space, and whether or not you had sex with anyone was really not the point.
The point was is that everybody there was willing to be nude, available maybe for sex and open.
Sex with another man is a fantasy of mine.
I'm someone else.
It's an ego trip.
I think that's exactly what it is.
It's an ego trip having some other man, other than my husband, telling me "you're beautiful.
You're good in bed." all this, you know?
It's really a fantasy for me.
And it also felt like you had a secret, that you had a secret world that most of the people who were either going to work or just going about their business in the city that they didn't know what you had experienced.
Again, it's not just sex.
It's not going in there and say, "I'm going in there 'cause I just want to grab somebody and I wanna..."
Can I say certain words?
Okay.
"...get laid."
I was a social worker in 1978.
But I had good evenings after my social work.
# oh, how happy # # you have made me # # oh, how happy # # you have made me #
# I have kissed your lips # # a thousand times... #
Van Peebles:
I remember once, this couple--
I'm sure they've been thrown out of every swingers club in the world because they were so large.
They had to weigh 300 lbs each.
And they were jitterbugging.
They were dancing.
They had on their towels.
They had to have double towels around them.
And the towels, of course, fell off.
And then nobody gave a doo-doo-caca.
But what happened was-- it was when they stomped, they were shaking the-- the-- the-- the Platters for the DJ because they weighed so much.
I mean, they were shaking the whole damn floor.
But it was-- nobody cared.
It was really very very nice.
This was Larry Levenson's castle.
Plato's Retreat was the way that Larry could embrace everybody and-- and-- exude his generosity, his bounty.
Family togetherness today at a place called Plato's Retreat.
This afternoon the owner held an open house there for children.
In most cases it was a family affair at Plato's today...
Michael Levenson:
The first time I actually went to the club, the club was closed.
My father used to run, like, holiday parties--
Memorial Day, Labor Day.
He would actually rent the big bus, have it parked at my high school.
I would invite 40 of my best friends.
- Woman:
Do you mind that yourmothercomeshere?
- No, I don't care.
He had a disco and there was a game room there.
Everything was the same as if it was open, except there was no nudity or no sex.
It was a bunch of kids.
That's when we started understanding what everything was about.
He used to be called-- what?
King of Swing.
Yeah, that's right.
He was called King of Swing.
# at Plato's Retreat... #
Larry, let us into your heart a minute.
A lot of people are saying Larry Levenson, a lot of people say sleaze.
I heard the President's speech the other night.
He talked about truth, service, sacrifice, the American dream.
And then we see in this country a disintegration of the American family--
That's what you're really telling us.
That's what Plato's Retreat
- is about-- or monogamy is dead.
- Oh no.
- Man:
No!
- Siegel:
I'm saying that--
Mary:
This is a preservation in a sense, Stanley.
Don't you realize how many men say
"I'm going out with the boys tonight,"
- And they cheat and they lie?
- The question is why aren't you in jail?
We're here at the New York Aquarium now.
- ( laughing )
- Watching orca Shamu do his thing.
Larry, you know, I've never really gotten a chance to talk to you.
Why don't you play with my ass and tell me your philosophy of life?
Whoo!
- Oh my god, he's doing it.
- Bacho:
Larry got involved withyoungerwomen, wanted to hang out with these women that took him for his money-- the money he didn't have and the drugs he did have.
Larry was boring because he thought his whole world was sex.
His world was genitalia.
Again, he never read a book.
He never had a thought.
It was all about him as a legend.
He really thought that when it came to swinging he was-- everyone looked at him as "The King" literally.
We got people from Fort Lauderdale.
We got people from California.
We got people from Paris, France, coming to Plato's.
They fly in.
We're the eighth wonder of the world.
Okay?
I think it's different, but I don't think it's immoral.
This is the biggest thing to hit New York city since the World's Fair.
And it is.
Dorfman:
The interesting thing about Larry was
The guy was getting social security checks.
He didn't have any money, yet he was able to borrow $150,000.
Where does a guy get $150,000?
Goldstein:
He was Colonel Sanders and he had to do his little step--
Step-and-fix-it routine.
Donahue:
Is it your view we're gonna have Plato's Retreats-- it's gonna be part of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, too someday?
Within the next three months there will be four more Plato's Retreats around the country.
Larry started to believe the bullshit.
I bullshit all the time when I'm interviewing.
Larry did too, but Larry exaggerated the importance.
I always argued, "It's just fucking."
What is fucking?
It's friction.
You believe in a free society?
A free society where people can just have a good time and enjoy themselves the way they want to, without hurting anybody else.
It's a devastating therapy.
- Larry:
But it works for them.
- Man:
Is it for them?
Hanson:
I saw a fight between a couple there at Plato's once where the husband had found out that his wife had mended the pants for a man who was there.
And in fact they'd had sex many times, but it was this little personal touch that showed affection that made the husband insane.
I could never bring somebody special, somebody I cared about there.
I couldn't handle my wife or my girlfriend being with somebody else.
And me sitting and watching?
You really did see that sometimes that what they came out for bit them in the behind.
They got more than what they really bargained for.
If I wanted to have an affair with a man or sleep with a man that I felt attractive, I can do it.
And Michael knows about it.
It's like dual infidelity.
Interviewer:
Do you think Larry is faithful to you out of Plato's Retreat?
For example, is he with other women, do you think?
- Yes, very definitely.
- How do you know?
- I don't have time.
- Trust.
I believe Mary...
Always had feelings for Larry.
I think her whole life was wrapped around him, wrapped around the lifestyle.
Most people look at Plato's as the new sexual lifestyle of the 21st century.
Honestly what most people feel--
I know this is another judgment-- they feel something's gone wrong here.
Mary:
Well, maybe something has.
Maybe every marriage in this country has a little something wrong with it.
She knew the people.
She knew the crowd.
And I think, like anything else, too much of something could freak you out.
There was no Mary room.
There was no... fancy room where Mary could sit up there and be queen and men would come and court her.
They seemed to have a respectful relationship for a time.
I don't have much more to add about that.
No, I don't remember much more-- same.
- Are you married?
- No, uh...
- We were-
- I was--
- Are you married?
--in strictly monogamous relationships.
- In a sense--
- You don't hear me.
--In a sense, David, we are married because I intend to spend the rest of my life with Larry whether he likes it or not, but, uh...
- But technically no?
- Technically no, we're not.
Man:
What is the address of the new Plato's and what is the opening date?
The grand opening will be December 5th, on a Friday night at 9:00 P.M.
That's of this year, of course.
When the 34th street location opened, it was hopping.
Larry:
This is the matt room.
This is a place where you get 20, 30 couples in here at one time.
You must be undressed to come in here.
It's a beautiful sight.
Veronica Vera:
It was located directly across from McDonald's.
And people used to say it had become the McDonald's of sex.
Nina:
I was this normal housewife person.
My husband left, his girlfriend was having a baby.
And you meet different people.
I was working at the movie theater in the village.
I was selling the tickets to "Rocky Horror."
And the first time I went to Plato's, it seemed people-- like actually doing something in the open, you just-- you don't believe what you saw.
Because it was like turning a page in a magazine and you're sitting there and then you make up your mind.
You know, you're either into it or you're not.
And I was into it.
One time I was standing there by the ladies' room in the back and a young girl came up to me, and she said to me, "are you outrageous?"
And I said, "yes, I am." and with that I put my hand on her breast.
She said, "perhaps you'd like to join us?"
I said, "oh, thank you very much"
and I was invited to go in this room with seven other ladies.
Another time I was there with a young gentleman and he knew this couple:
The lady was Chinese, the husband was a white gentleman.
And he said to me, "You want to do something with them?
The husband doesn't do anything.
He just sits in the corner.
We could be with the lady, the three of us."
And I said okay.
And the husband just sat there in the corner.
Like touching his wife's shoulder, but not joining in.
( camera clicks )
I was going to be President of the P.T.A.
What do you want out of your life that you're not getting from Mary?
That I am not getting from Mary?
There is no man in the world that can say that his woman gives him every need that he has-- that there is to have.
I want as much as I can possibly have in this lifetime.
And that's what I'm doing.
I'm enjoying myself,
I'm happy and that's the bottom line.
Smith:
One of his constant refrains whenever he was interviewed or talked to anybody was swinging and Plato's will not save a bad marriage.
It's something extra you do in a great marriage for fun.
As swinging was explained to me by him when I was a kid was:
There is no jealousy.
You know?
Swinging is a thing where couples are in a relationship with each other.
Okay?
They have feelings for each other as if non-swingers do.
But the only difference is that when they're with someone else, it's just sex.
There's no feelings.
Ferrato:
I never saw him going around with Mary.
I never saw them having sex with other couples.
It was always Larry.
Do you have relationships with other men there?
- Occasionally, yes.
- Does he know about it?
Yes.
- Do you countenance it?
- I think it's fantastic.
Hanson:
Mary would be having a lot of men.
You weren't really supposed to have a gangbang just out on the main floor.
You were supposed to go somewhere, and Larry might speak to Mary about it, and then he'd go off and-- ohhh-- you know, and say, "Mary's upset."
We'd say, "Mary doesn't look upset.
Mary looks like she's having a good time."
"No, Mary's upset."
Vance:
She was losing Larry, not just to the lifestyle, but to one particular woman or another.
Do you really believe that you can make love to a person one time and fall in love with them?
I don't think it can happen.
I really don't.
I've never seen it happen.
He was there just to have sex.
The whole thing was how many women he could get.
Vance:
She wasn't having it and I don't blame her.
So she went on with this affair with the chauffeur.
Mary and Larry were-- were--
He was starting to tell her to stay home, and the chauffeur knew both of them because he used to drive both of them to Plato's.
It ended badly.
They wanted to kill each other.
The chauffeur was in love with Mary.
Larry was in love with Mary.
Mary was in love with the chauffeur-- it was this big nasty triangle.
- Larry would send Mary home with Ron.
- Yeah.
So maybe one thing led to another.
I think in the end he...
The chauffeur had Larry kidnapped, beaten to a pulp, sent-- put in the hospital in an effort to end it in his favor.
That's what I believe happened.
- I never seen a guy that was beat--
- So beat up.
- I mean--
- His face was like out to here.
I think Larry Levenson wound up in the hospital in Queens stemming from this conflict between him, Mary and the chauffeur.
After the kidnapping, Mary came by the club a couple of times.
You know, she seemed basically out of it.
You know, she was older and at one point she might have been the queen, but she definitely wasn't now.
( crowd cheering )
( couple laughing )
Vance:
She almost wound up on the street.
She was institutionalized, I believe, at Bellevue for a while and she did have a breakdown.
She was really a nice woman.
Nice lady.
Maybe they made up that story that it was this guy
- to stay away from the wiseguys.
- Ron.
We don't know.
Why it happened, we never knew.
But even then Larry was running around, like, in a wheelchair and he was perfectly fine.
He was saying, "Aw, it's nothing."
I'll be fine.
I'll be walking." and he was.
He was, like, smiling through it all.
Plato's Retreat is an unlicensed club
- for swinging couples, right?
- Larry:
We have a charter.
In approximately July of 1979, there had been some newspaper article wherein Larry Levenson had stated and boasted that,
"We don't pay taxes for Plato's Retreat Inc."
We are definitely a non-profit corporation.
- Now wait a minute, Larry.
What do you mean a non-profit?
- I'm telling you.
Annie:
Two gentlemen appeared 9:00 in the morning.
I'm half asleep.
And they says, "We came here to see the books."
So I gave them the books.
I didn't know they were from the Internal Revenue.
And they find out they got a gold mine in front of them, that these people have been cheating their income tax for three years.
In one year I think they claimed only $300 of taxable income and paid zero tax.
Davidson:
Ann Grippo reentered the business room.
She looked over our shoulder and was peering intently.
She just blurted out voluntarily,
"we're dead."
I tried to take the books away from them.
- ( laughs ) Yeah?
- And I did, I took the books.
They didn't keep them.
They weren't allowed to keep them.
- Correct.
- I took them.
- But now they know that they have--
- Wait.
- So now you got the books back in your hand.
- Yeah.
- Did you call Larry?
- When they came in that night I told them what happened.
- You didn't do nothing tillthatnight?
- No, till that night.
Hy said to me, "You know, I covered our tracks here for three years.
Now we're dead."
There was nothing I could say or do except that, "hey, I'm sorry."
When they came home that night, they packed their bags and they were gone.
They were so terrified that they were gonna get whacked.
I didn't hear from them again--
It's funny.
I laugh because when I saw them again it was on TV.
Host:
Come on up here, Grippos.
Charlie and Ann Grippo.
Welcome.
What did you yell, Charlie, when you were running up here?
- We're coming!
- We're coming and we'll getitright if it takes us all night.
He went onto some kind of quiz show in Vegas.
Both:
"Las Vegas Gambit."
- You're from where?
- New York City.
- On vacation?
- Yes.
Charlie:
I don't think we're sitting there five minutes.
Yeah, just about five minutes we heard--
We get two cards and it's blackjack.
- And you get $1,000.
- And we win $1200.
Or $1,000.
She jumps up... ( cheers )
We're gonna send you the tape.
Funny as hell.
Hysterical.
Baby, baby.
( laughing ) And I thought to myself,
"these guys are running from the mob and here they are advertising who they--"
- We got a trip to the Super Bowl.
- A washer-dryer.
And what about the V.C-- not a V.C.R., that--
- A Betamax.
- The Betamax.
- We won a load of stuff.
- A load of stuff.
It was a trial.
On trial was Larry,
Hy, Frank, the accountant.
Larry took the stand and tried to explain the circumstances.
He believed that he was in a-- a non-profit, not-for-profit club and that he truly believed that.
Larry Levenson wasn't on the stand.
He was on the stage.
Everything was a joke to him, or so it appeared.
Sudler:
I think the jury, as I recall, was laughing at him.
The trial was completed.
The jury deliberated for approximately five or six hours, I believe.
And came back with guilty verdicts.
Larry Levenson, Frank Pernice, Hy Gordon received eight years plus a fine.
I think an eight-year jail sentence at that time for this type of a tax evasion was something of a record.
Goldstein:
What fucked him up was he was stealing cash.
And he did the dumbest thing of all.
If any of you ever do cash or have your own company, you don't do it in front of employees, 'cause the guy who's working for you or the gal who's working for you, you're gonna fire them or yell at them and they're gonna bring you down.
A lot of cash-- just like Studio 54!
I don't believe he was stealing money,
I don't believe that he was creating books that-- didn't exist.
I mean--
Double books?
Larry was being King of Swing.
The demeanor at the defense table changed.
All of a sudden there was silence upon the announcement of the verdict.
There was no more affable, class-clown Larry Levenson.
It was total silence.
Breitbart:
If you break the law, there's an old saying in the business:
"If ya can't affords the time, ya don't commits the crime."
True.
# happiness, happiness # # the greatest gift that I possess #
# I thank the lord that I've been blessed... #
Some of you may have been wondering whatever happened to Larry Levenson?
He's here in Allenwood, which is a federal penitentiary.
It's considered a level-one prison.
In the trunk we'd have clothes, suitcases, golf clubs, a tennis racket.
We thought it was a place where you basically just-- you hung out but you couldn't leave.
The lack of sex-- very rarely discussed or anything.
Everybody takes care of that situation by themselves, you know?
We were in constant communication.
- And he never complained about it, right?
- Right.
# the greatest gift that I possess #
Woman:
"Larry Levenson, you're okay, even though you've gone away.
You got into an awful mess.
You just can't fuck with the I.R.S."
Goldstein:
Plato's without Larry was like Easter at the Vatican without the Pope.
The Pope had this tracheotomy and the Christians are running amok.
Gillis:
Without Larry, Plato's took a big dive.
And it wasn't Plato's anymore.
It wasn't-- it wasn't even wholesome anymore.
You know?
Because without that benevolent heart behind it, it was just a tacky swingers club, you know?
Vera:
It required a lot more people to fill the place.
So they had special parties-- sometimes they would have kinky nights.
I, uh, use the...
Uh, the Pussy Propulsion which is the basis for all space travel.
Man:
Belle du jour presents an SM costume ball and dinner party.
Do they have to be in costume?
Not necessarily, but it would be fun.
I'm here every Tuesday and it starts at 8:15.
And I fulfill all their fantasies in SM... and all erotic fantasies.
Sounds good to me.
I'm Danny the wonder pony.
I give women pony rides.
I dance in a fashion that makes them look and feel like they're riding a pony,
Except to the music.
And if you've ever watched a woman ride a horse, it's very erotic.
( crowd shouting )
He had foxy boxing, which was girls fighting each other.
Okay, stick around.
Next match coming soon.
Lincoln:
The amusing part of that is in between each round the girls would throw up in a bucket.
There were brothers and sisters.
Those things weren't as taboo as they are now.
# if you like what we're doing when we're doing what we're doing # # come on, clap your hands # # if you like what we're doing when we're doing what we're doing #
# hey-yyyy!
#
Stewart:
I remember they had girls up there--
I think they were porno stars-- performing, doing musical feats.
# party party # # party party... #
Stewart:
And there were men in the audience who were masturbating-- if my memory serves me correct.
Man:
Don't you, on certain levels, feel that swinging sort of has shot its load?
That it's a tired phenomena that dates back more to the '60s and '70s?
- And for the '80s nobody really gives a shit?
- No, on the contrary.
I think swinging is just now really coming into its own.
Jeremy:
While Larry was in jail he did these little weekly announcements that were really cute.
What about your job?
- Did you say you worked in the sewer system?
- Yeah.
We would set up a tape recorder that was attached to the telephone.
( laughs ) He wants to be heard from prison or no.
- What do you do?
- I test the...
The garbage, what?
Do you eat it?
Yeah, the waste and everything.
No, the amoeba eats it.
He had senators there with him.
He had judges there with him.
He had lawyers there with him.
It was not a terrible place to be.
When that water goes into the river, you can actually drink it.
# happiness!
#
I got a phone call from a friend of mine who says, "you're not going to believe this.
I just heard on the radio that the King of Swing is home from prison."
Man:
I just want to say now, ladies and gentlemen, that I am more than proud to present for the first time back here in 32 months, the man responsible for creating Plato's Retreat, ladies and gentlemen, the owner, the creator
of Plato's Retreat, the King of Swing,
Mr. Larry Levenson.
Come right out, gang.
Man #2:
Okay, Larry Levenson, skinnier, his dick is bigger.
Here he is, Larry, back from 32 months of homosexuality.
What's it like to be here at the place, the dream you created?
You know, the person who doesn't know how to answer you.
- You're such a slob.
- We're here with his lovely mother Renee.
Renee, how do you feel that your son broke out of prison and is here at Plato's today?
I should have expected something like this from you, Al.
I'm not the least bit surprised.
It's not true you called the parole board and said, "keep the bastard"?
No, you did that, honey.
You were a little mixed up.
# and you try to show # # your love for me. #
Larry:
I'm thrilled to no end right now as I look around and see you friendly faces, faces of old friends and soon-to-be new friends.
To you members that frequent Plato's, our club is much more than a sexual haven.
We are the closest thing to a family here.
I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna make this club better than ever, and we're gonna have more fun than ever and it's just gonna be beautiful.
Larry, we welcome you back and congratulations on completing the 32-month Allenwood diet.
Everything hits a peak, so there was a peak for sexuality.
There was a peak for disco.
# karma karma karma karma karma chameleon... #
The club was in a decline and so was Larry.
Were we distressed about it?
Yes.
Come down and fulfill your most fantastic fantasies and stimulate your wildest dreams.
# oh yes, it's ladies' night # # and the feeling's right... #
Man:
Is it going to be ladies' night every Monday, do you know?
Ladies' night, 6:00-9:00;
then 9:00 the men come in.
Vera:
They would have at Plato's singles nights to kind of introduce people who never swung before.
# oh yes, it's ladies' night # # oh, what a night, oh, what a night... #
Vera:
There'd be stripper after stripper and the women are getting wilder and wilder.
Then 9:00, or a couple of hours later, the men-- the single men would be allowed in.
And these guys were horny fucks.
Then what they'd do though, they'd have to have a lot more girls that would be like girls that would be hired.
Hanson:
But you couldn't necessarily separate the prostitutes from the wives because the wives were kind of doing themselves up like prostitutes often.
There was coke everywhere.
And everybody used it to stay awake, to keep going, for this, that and the other thing, to feel better.
Stay up, keep going,
Don't stop.
I'm gonna have fun.
Goldstein:
Prostitution was the tail that wagged the dog.
Because I believe 40%-50% of the girls there every night, with their, quote, date, were hookers.
And I know that to be a fact because the hookers advertised in "screw."
Stewart:
I remember I met an African-American woman and we went into the back and we went into one of the rooms and the next thing she stuck her hand out and she wanted money from me.
And I just didn't have it, you know?
She said, "Well, I'm sorry."
There was just this-- a sense of impending doom.
But I don't know how much we talked about it.
It lost the warmth.
And that wasn't, I think, just the steam rising off of all that water they had going in there.
It was moving towards that point in the '80s when sex was terrifying.
( "Dream Weaver" playing )
# I've just closed my eyes again... #
Narrator:
AIDS reduces the number of helper cells in the blood.
Therefore the body has no way of either detecting or attacking certain infections.
# driver, take away my worries of today... #
When AIDS first hit, nobody even knew what it was yet.
No one quite knew how it was transmitted.
- No one knew how to have safe sex.
- # dream Weaver #
# I believe you can get me through the night... #
The people who cared about their lives stopped going to sex clubs.
And so you got a more hardcore, self-destructive
- group of people.
- # Dream Weaver. #
All this talk about AIDS, aren't you worried about it?
Being with so many different men?
Larry, I've never heard of a woman that has contacted AIDS through sexual intercourse.
I went from one extreme to the other, saying "this is not something you get a shot for, or take a pill for.
This is your life.
- And you need to rethink your priorities in life." - ( heart beating )
And I say god was kind and I was spared.
Some other people were not that lucky.
That 73% of the AIDS cases are in homosexuals, this is put out by the State of New York, Dr. Axelrod.
- ( man ranting on phone )
- Wait, let me-- let me finish.
Sir-- sir, let me finish.
Danny:
It was like a ghost town.
For about 30 days, it was like nobody.
Everybody was just scared.
They didn't even know if you could get it mouth to mouth.
Reporter:
The St. Marks Bathhouse was shut down after undercover inspectors reported that they had observed 49 acts of high-risk sexual activity involving more than 80 people.
Ronald Reagan:
Only medical science can ever truly defeat AIDS.
I think that Koch, who I admired, wanted to bust down on the gay clubs.
To make things even, he busted down on Plato's.
Man on phone:
They said that AIDS did go through Plato's Retreat.
No, they came down and interviewed me.
And that's all they did.
And we found out since that with the smell of chlorine in the air at Plato's Retreat, the AIDS virus does not have a chance.
It just happens to be a factual thing.
Doron Gopstein:
One of the key parts of the effort would be to collect evidence, which if it was necessary, if it became necessary to seek to close a place down, this is the kind of evidence that would hold up in court.
Larry had signs posted.
And he has his security that are walking around actually telling people,
"Wait till this little thing is over with.
But right now, we can't allow anal sex, we can't allow oral sex on a guy."
The law prohibits anal sex and fellatio.
- Excuse me?
- You can have sexual intercourse legally on Plato's premises.
Hello?
Some of the inspectors were so... uh, overwhelmed-- distressed by what they saw that they needed actually counseling and counseling was provided.
"Government of the people, for the people and by the people should not perish from this earth."
Now Mr. Koch is trying to tell me that the people have nothing to do with government.
It's like a war.
You're fighting the city.
Man on phone:
I want to talk to the fat guy on the right.
There are two fat guys here.
Which one?
On the right?
Go ahead, fat guy.
- What do you have to say?
- Do you suck?
Oh, you're a moron.
Good evening.
Plato's Retreat is the latest casualty in New York's war on dangerous sex.
Gopstein:
Inspectors would come in and they described what to us seemed like prostitution activities.
Reporter:
In its prime, thousands of heterosexual couples flocked to Plato's Retreat.
But the party came to a halt at the well-known nightclub.
Minutes before its scheduled opening, city officials closed the venue on charges of prostitution.
The city knows as everybody else knows we never allowed prostitution on our premises, and I always say that we never will.
Gopstein:
So we went in there and the judge signed the preliminary injunction.
It went to an appellate court and the appellate court changed the temporary closing order.
- Hello, you're on the air.
- Yeah, hi.
Um, can you tell me what the status of the club is right now?
And, um... is it still closed or what are they doing at this point?
- At Plato's, you mean, sir?
- Yes, sir.
Plato's Retreat is now open.
( feedback squeals )
The place is reopened and we send inspectors in there again.
And within a short period of time, the inspectors are coming back and they're saying, "forget about prostitution now.
We're seeing high-risk sexual activities."
Starting tonight for the next year, all profits made by Plato's Retreat, will be donated to AIDS research.
Two weeks later, New Year's Eve, boof!
We get closed for good.
Tonight the city closed Plato's Retreat, that notorious heterosexual sex club on Manhattan's West Side.
Larry:
Plato's Retreat is more than just a club.
It's an institution.
It's a monument to sexual freedom.
And they set us back 50 years.
Plato's was then closed on December 31st.
And actually, it never reopened after that.
I remember driving up at 7:30 and seeing the door padlocked with the police tape on it.
And... there was no notice, no nothing.
They didn't tell anyone that we're going to be closing you down.
They just came on New Year's Eve.
I think it was to spank them.
Larry's really really upset.
He's almost holding back tears.
You could see it.
Because now he knows that the city just crippled him and he's looking at the future.
He goes, "I can't stay open, Ron.
The money I made from New Year's Eve was going to keep me going with rent."
Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.
Everything fell apart:
All the connections, the phone calls-- everything stopped.
We have no meeting ground anymore.
We have no home for the family anymore.
So everybody takes off to different areas.
Everybody goes back to real life.
From what I could see, most clubs in Manhattan lasted a few years.
They'd be really hot, maybe six, eight, 10 years and then they'd close down.
And people were on to the new club.
I think Plato's kind of died a natural death actually.
It might have had a little help.
It was a different era then with everything that was going on.
A place like that...
It wasn't going to last anyway.
A lot of people...
Just couldn't-- don't like the lifestyle so they put it down, like our mayors and our governors.
But meanwhile they're the ones in here.
It was like, "We should all sing 'Old Lang Sone'--"
"Old Lang..."
- Man: "Syne."
- Whatever.
"--'Old Lang whatever.'"
After the club closed
I think that's when it took him over completely.
I think that's when Larry really fell into hard times--
No finances.
Tonight we're talking with Larry Levenson.
Larry was the owner of Plato's Retreat.
Plato's Retreat was the largest swing club in New York.
Goldstein:
He was the original prototype swinger.
That was his life.
That was why he started the club.
And basically the club ended because of that narcissism.
You start believing it and you think you can do no wrong and you're gonna beat the system.
Larry was depressed.
And I'd visit him in his apartment in Brooklyn and he'd be doing crack cocaine.
And he's sweating-- "Larry, you're sweating like a pig.
It doesn't look like you're having fun."
He goes, "trust me.
It's a nice feeling and it takes away the pain."
He went to parents without partners and he was enjoying that and meeting lots of different people.
And he did meet Marilyn there.
- I just got engaged last week.
- Mazel tov.
- A beautiful young lady, yeah.
- Mazel tov.
- Yeah, I'm very happy.
- And she's sweet woman.
She is wonderful.
And the whole point is what do I want to do with my life?
Don't know how long it was good.
I do remember one incident where he asked me to go to the house and pick up a check.
He got divorced again, so now... now he's back to being single and he's back in Brooklyn again.
Remember he was driving a cab?
He was driving a cab, I remember that.
# I still get that same old feeling # # tearing at this heart of mine... #
Nina:
I hailed a yellow cab.
I got in.
and sometimes I have a habit of looking at the hack license.
When my dad had the club, he had all the friends.
Everybody wanted to hang out with him.
Then when he didn't have the club, they were gone.
I saw the name Larry Levenson.
And I kept saying, "Larry Levenson, Larry Levenson?
That's the man who owned Plato's."
You have to pick and choose who your friends are.
And you have to stay grounded.
I think my dad was never grounded.
Larry:
I thought that we were a great family.
And I really believed, truly, that we were a community.
But I guess I was mistaken.
It was me...
( laughs ) that felt that.
I was the king.
One day he invited us to Brooklyn to see his house.
And he lived down in the basement because...
The brick building, he rented upstairs--
I guess the two floors.
And I was shocked the way he lives down in the basement with cats and everything.
It both-- my mind-- how could he live in a basement?
Then he took us out for a nice lobster dinner.
He had just gone through heart surgery.
He was in the hospital.
We were living down here.
He had had a heart attack.
He was in the intensive care unit.
I brought some flowers for his nurses.
He seemed in good spirits.
When I heard that Larry Levenson died from a heart attack and that he'd become a cab driver
I just thought, "wow, that was just so hard to reconcile that the king of Plato's Retreat
Could end up like a broken-down old hack."
I just remember getting a phone call that Larry's passed away.
I was pretty miserable for quite a while.
It was one of the ones that really hurt.
When Larry started Plato's,
We were still in that period where sex wasn't just sex and pleasure, it was also about kind of revolution, a breaking with the past.
I think the only difference between Larry and many men in our society and culture is that Larry didn't hesitate to talk about it and tell the truth about it, how he actually felt.
I wonder how many men hide how they really feel about sex.
Or how many men would have the courage to say
"I want to do them all"?
Every time I drive by the club, even to this day,
I still feel the magic.
Look at it, the lights are still here.
Oh, there's disco lights over there.
The sprinkler system was here.
There's our fan, still up there to this day.
Whatever Frankie built, it's still there.
So... amazing.
Dodson:
One thing about getting older is that you don't want to look back and say
"Wow, really I'm sorry I didn't do that.
I really am sorry I missed that.
I really am sorry I didn't take advantage of that."
I'm an old lady with no regrets, because I'll tell you:
Those-- that period was very special.
It was the same routine every night but different bodies.
Different sizes.
Tall, short--
It was, you know, a sight to see...
Every night.
- ( camera clicks )
- Breitbart:
Somehow whenever anybody discusses Plato's Retreat, they do it with a smile on their face.
If anybody was there, they're happy.
If anybody wasn't there, they're only sorry that they didn't get an opportunity to go there and see it.
( camera clicks )
Karen:
It was very exciting to a lot of people.
And when we finally caught up with it, we were amused by it as well.
I'm-
- I'm really glad I went.
I'm glad to have the experience of having gone.
Just as I'm glad that I got to the top of the World Trade Center once.
Even to today people say things to me:
"I knew your father.
I remember your father."
Okay, some people, they have no memories.
They had a boring normal...
Let's say everyday-straight kind of life.
I've led a different kind of life.
I've had that life and my life changed...
By going to Plato's... by getting into open sex.
These are things that you never thought you would ever do in life.
You didn't even think about it.
So a lot of people, they don't have those memories.
I have those memories.
I can see the faces in front of me now.
Nina:
It was good for me.
it was good for me.
It was great for me.
Is Larry still around, by the way?
- Are you guys talking to Larry?
- Man:
He passed away in '99.
- He passed away?
- Yeah.
- He was only about 50.
- 62.
Wow.
( pop music playing )
# oh, how happy # # you have made me # # oh, how happy # # you have made me #
# I have kissed your lips # # a thousand times # # and more times than I can count #
# I have called you mine # # you have stood... #
Karen:
I tried to hide the fact
That Larry Levenson was my brother.
after all, my name was Karen Posner.
It wasn't too difficult, I thought, to keep it a secret.
But of course everybody knew because of the car showing up at the house and Larry marching into all of our backyard barbecues.
I saw people getting down in various stages.
Big deal.
What did you expect?
Where do you expect babies come from?
I wouldn't just take my clothes off and just walk around like that.
You know?
Have I done anything there?
I really can't talk about that... if I've ever done anything there.
What is the difference between parsley and pussy?
He says, "What is the difference?" I says,
"Well, who eats parsley?"
One of Larry's ideas was that he seriously believed that he could have sex with every single woman in New York and I was going to help him do it.
What do you say to something like that?
We laugh.
That's what keeps a marriage going sometimes is laughter.
I mean he makes me laugh, I make him laugh.
- And now we have a new life.
- Uh uh uh!
Yeah, but now we got a new life.
- But uh uh uh.
- No, home.
Oh yeah.
Our poker life.
Now we can't wait to get back to Vegas in December.
Go ahead.
What else?

Subtitles by LeapinLar
We're talking about swinging, two couples who swing.
Larry Levenson is here.
He's owner of Plato's Retreat in New York City, an actual commercial establishment where people can go and swing.
Some of the tenets of swingers include the separation of-- what they say is the separation of sex and love.
We promote social intercourse and sexual intercourse.
Whatever you want to do, you can do.
- Aren't you illegal?
- No.
No way.
Sex is not illegal anyplace in New York.
But I couldn't open a cathouse, could I?
Well, that's paid sex.
The '70s were a transitional period.
It was when the ethic of the '60s took hold.
1500 cops are injured.
People were complaining New York had become a pit of vice.
That contributed to disco and Plato's also played its part in suddenly turning things around in New York and making New York what it was-- the most exciting city in the world.
- # you make me feel... # - it was a party town.
1977 in New York was a fabulous year.
Sexuality was in the air.
Everybody was immensely curious.
Lots and lots of heteros would go to the gay clubs just to look at the glory holes.
And lots of people who were not remotely exhibitionistic would go to Plato's.
Swing couples went there to swap.
You try my wife and I'll try your wife.
Forget about the sex.
You could wander around.
You could actually swim.
You could eat this free third-rate buffet... which I always considered tempting, but dangerous.
They had dancing.
They had a show.
I thought to myself, "this really can't be real.
Maybe I'm watching a dirty movie."
But it was a dirty movie that really came to life.
Friends of mine said that they went there by looking at it on cable television.
I was never in Plato's Retreat.
I have no idea if they in fact took off-- other than clothing.
10 years earlier everyone was rolling around naked in Woodstock, you know, and smoking pot and screwing their brains out, you know, in the meadows.
So this was just an indoor version that was accessible to New Yorkers.
I am Larry's sister.
We were five years apart.
We were very very close and we grew up as best friends.
My parents had a very conventional lifestyle and marriage.
My father was a hard-working man.
He was in the kosher meat business.
Oldest memories of Larry are as a... smiling young man, didn't really love the academic pursuits.
When I first met Larry, he had just gotten out of the service.
He had told me that his father had a butcher shop and he was a wholesale distributer of briskets.
And he would work nights.
And I really feel that some of the times that he said he was working, he wasn't working.
When he first married Gloria, I don't think any of us thought that it wouldn't last because we didn't know anybody who had separated or divorced.
I thought he was cheating on me.
My dad and my mom got divorced when I was six.
So my dad really wasn't around a lot.
My parents separated when I was very young.
So my first recollection actually is when my dad used to work at McDonald's and he brought me the hamburglar-- it was a little stuffed hamburglar.
So that's what I used to sleep with-
- I used to sleep with a little hamburglar.
All I can remember is through those years, my mother yelling at my father on the phone, "they're waiting for you.
You didn't show up.
You said you were coming."
And of course every business that Larry was in was on the weekends.
So the times when fathers would be with their children,
Larry was either off selling sodas on the beach or preparing for swingers parties, wherever they might be held.
I was very surprised when Larry was involved in that kind of lifestyle.
I really didn't think that it was something that would be his thing to do.
But maybe I just didn't know him that well.
# what's our favorite evening game?
# # night baseball?
# # oh, baby, you're all wet # # let's swap partners is the name # # suburban roulette... #
You know what I don't like to see is this thing about you have to be monogamous.
I say nobody's monogamous.
And if you make somebody say that you're fucking monogamous and you're gonna be legitimate,
"I married her.
I'm never gonna fuck," I'm a liar.
The swinging movement was very small and very secret.
We all have jobs and we all pay mortgages.
Just because we consider ourselves swingers, we're not freaks of nature.
# I love your sister # # tomorrow night... #
At a swing party, you can go, you can find-- meet other people that maybe can meet some of your sexual needs that maybe your spouse can't.
And yet you don't have to go out and cheat.
Swinging is a situation where a man and a woman, part of their sex life is to find other couples or other people that have similar interests, that they like socially, they like to be with, but in particular they want to have sex with.
# suburban roulette... # # suburban roulette!
#
The meeting area was usually a bar that they took over for Friday, Saturday night.
I worked as a waitress and some guys used to come in and they brought in "screw" magazine and I brought it home and I showed it to Charlie.
- And that's all it took.
- And there were all kinds of ads in it.
- And we started to think about it.
- Get interested.
It was interesting.
It was a place for them to dance, have a drink, meet each other.
I remember it looked more like a Bar Mitzvah.
# hey, little girl, get your dancing shoes # # gold satin jacket... #
I don't know anybody's last name in any of these places.
And yet you can go home with them, make love to them, spend the weekend with them, kiss them goodbye--
"see you next week, John, Mary.
Bye-bye."
And that's the end of it and you're best friends for life.
People would be handing out slips that say,
"okay, there's a party on the east side tonight."
The only problem is when you're stoned, and I said, "Now I gotta go to Queens?"
# the roller coaster gotta make the most # # and dance dance dance... #
I met Larry Levenson at a party back in the mid-'70s in Coney Island, Brooklyn.
And he started arranging some organized swing parties.
He liked the idea of being able to have that scene out in the open the way gay bars did.
It was a one-man band at the beginning.
It was just him and Mary and maybe a couple of other people.
Mary made all the phone calls.
Mary did a lot of the footwork.
Mary was actually responsible for putting together the logo of Plato's.
The backward twos was Mary's idea.
I'm going to ask you one of my favorite indiscreet questions.
How did you and Larry meet?
Now come on, the truth now.
Well, I had come with another young man to Plato's in its first location.
And I fell in love with him on the spot.
# when I get home, babe... #
Mary and Larry were swingers
And they started the club together.
And it seemed like a perfect idea and a way to be close.
So it was a family thing.
# I wanna kiss you all over... #
What did he say?
Do you remember?
Out with it!
I was on my way to the ladies' room and he told me to come on in the water.
And I told him I couldn't right then because I was on my way to the ladies' room.
And he said, "come on in.
The water's nice and warm and that's how it got that way."
That's it, that's Larry-- Mr. Taste.
- You got to know Mary better than me...
- Yes.
...Physically and mentally.
That might have been your first female, I think.
Really, huh?
- No.
- No?
It mushroomed from there.
Got ahold of a hotel-- this hotel basement pool area.
Yeah, so this call came in from somebody--
I don't remember who it is anymore, some friend or acquaintance and said, "there's this live sex club where people are having sex in front of everybody."
And I said, "you mean a gay bar?"
and they said, "no no, these are straight people."
# am I dreaming # # that you're with me?
#
- # am I dreaming... #
- Plato's was always for couples only.
And of course we always invited single ladies.
It was a tacky little place.
And sitting behind there is this guy Larry-- who I later learned is Larry Levenson.
He seemed in charge and he's sitting there in a towel, and that's it.
One of the best parts of it for me was that it was relaxed in the sense that people were coming and not necessarily doing anything.
Not even necessarily taking their clothes off.
Two of the men... were wearing no clothes except for black socks and shoes.
And walking around that way, kinda like that stag-film look.
So I wrote it up.
I played it pretty big.
And a few days later I went there-- went back.
# one thing I feel that I like... #
Plato's was a simple name.
It's the only one I could spell actually.
So we used Plato's.
Then after that I found out that Plato's was gay, but it was too late.
The lines were just unbelievable.
I mean we went from, what?
30, 40 couples or people to 400!
Now you have a lot of people that don't know the old crowd.
There were people that used to come to Plato's that to most people-- would say were not the most physically appealing, but they were the nicest people you'd ever want to meet in the world.
They were walking around with the black socks and the shoes, and this new group were just naked and much wilder.
People say, "hey, you got a date?
You want a night out?" et cetera, et cetera.
"You and your date, you got a date that's sort of on the wild side?"
Personally I think that with a little encouragement everybody's on the wild side.
All of a sudden he really was on a runaway tiger-- of sex.
- It was like a big party.
- There was literally lines around the block.
They were just coming down and in and taking over and dancing and holding hands, and hugging.
It was a sight.
Freaked me out.
I didn't know.
Plato's was becoming big.
We needed a big place.
We needed a special place.
He contacted a couple of good friends of his which I also knew:
Frank Pernice,
Frankie-- he was some sort of caterer.
Frank came home one day and said,
"what a great idea.
This has to be fantastic."
About a week or two weeks later, we met Hy Gordon there.
Could be dangerous.
They were gentlemen.
They were the type of people that they didn't have to throw their weight around, if you understand what I mean.
Why Larry had to hook up with these people--
I can't tell.
I don't know.
Frankie used to say that Larry had a grocery store and he turned it into a supermarket.
He ended up renting the Ansonia Hotel.
It was actually a gay...
- bathhouse.
- ...bathhouse.
In fact Bette Midler sang there.
And what's-his-name.
- The piano player-- Barry Manilow.
- Barry Manilow.
# Tootsie roll soul and doodle-white shoes... #
When I first heard about Plato's, all my ideas and everything I had heard about Plato's basically was wrong.
I thought that I would walk through the door and trip over a lot of fucking bodies in the middle of the floor.
And it just doesn't happen that way.
It was a dark door, just a rope outside.
It had a long stairway going down.
And I think the admissions people were at the top of the stairway.
Walking into Plato's is not necessarily an event in itself.
Just being there is the event.
Plato's Retreat is not a sex club, it's a swing club for free-thinking free-living adult couples.
It's a club with everything disco, everything included, with sex available if couples want it.
I asked, "what the fuck is it?"
You know?
There's like 20 mattresses laid together.
It was a dance floor.
Then you had the dance floor in front of me.
Most everyone was walking around naked.
As I said, at first we wrapped our towels around us when we first walked out, but then when we saw the atmosphere of everybody very free, laughing, kissing, and really without their towels, we figured what the heck.
I don't know, it was just kind of like a bathhouse locker room.
But I do think that there was
A lot of, like, coaching going on, at least with the women and encouragement, and a feeling of sisterhood like we're all in this together.
There was just lots of lonely people looking to meet other people.
Sex was part of the game, but it wasn't the whole game.
Nobody made fun of you.
Nobody said, "ugh!" you know?
How you look, how you look disgusting or whatever--
Any inhibitions you had you got over.
And you didn't have them anymore.
# I can see you coming a mile away... #
And you had a jacuzzi.
Anyone who went into the jacuzzi was insane
Because I think there was every kind of bacteria.
It was chemical warfare.
We played ping-pong.
We went swimming.
People have a sense of being cleansed in a pool.
This was a naughty pool.
Guys were floating on the top of the water
And their penises were sticking up and it looked like periscopes.
I had just come from Paris so I was a young photographer, and kind of a shy girl from Ohio.
So I-
- I--
I disrobed...
And I plunge into the pool.
And I'm swimming.
I, like, go.
I sort of underwatered the whole length of the pool.
And when I come up, I see all these men standing around the pool
And they're all jerking off.
And their come is, like, coming in an arc across the pool over my head.
It was just amazing.
That was one of my biggest regrets-- was that I didn't get that picture.
- You go there, right?
- Definitely, yes.
- There's a membership fee?
How much is it?
- Right.
It cost $25 per couple.
Now for that, you get a meal that was fantastic, like you get at any Bar Mitzvah, a full smorgasbord.
Chicken, ribs, chow mein, lasagna, meatballs.
- Spaghetti.
- No, lasagna.
- Oh, okay.
- Potato salad, macaroni.
- Cold cuts.
- Coleslaw.
- Cold cuts.
- Cold cuts.
- Did I say chicken?
- Yeah.
Why are you asking about that horrible food?
Jesus.
Which, by the way, Larry thought was wonderful.
Larry really thought that was wonderful.
He was so proud of his buffet.
But the buffet was disgusting.
There was people-- oral sex this and that--
All crazy sex things.
So we left there.
I said I want to go to the room and eat my sandwich.
So we went to another room-- I guess the pool table-- and they were having sex on the pool table.
We used to go buy pizza for ourselves and it was real good pizza and we said to Larry,
- "it would be nice after the food's almost gone"-- - just to break it up.
- About 1:00 in the morning.
- When you start running out of food and people come out of the orgy or they're dancing, swimming-- you feel like grabbing something.
They're tired of a bologna sandwich.
I said, "Hey, why don't you order 10 pies?"
"Why not?"
- You weren't hiding, were you?
- No.
- Did you meet a nice girl?
- No.
Everything was open except these few black cubicles.
That you could have private sex if you felt embarrassed to be doing it in front of the Japanese tourists.
You could hear conversations in the room to the right of you, on the left of you.
You'd hear women trying to figure out who was going to carpool to Hebrew School in the morning.
We spent some very very happy hours controlling our hysteria so that people inside wouldn't know that we were listening to the kind of forced dialogue between people who have just met in an orgy room.
It was good stuff.
I wish I'd recorded some of it.
When Larry showed me into this closed Cubicle and the woman in there was his wife Mary, he seemed almost excited to be able to introduce Mary to the press:
"Hi, Mary, how are you?
This is John Leo."
And again it was almost the enthusiasm of a Kiwanis executive showing off his home town.
- Why repress your desires?
- What?
- Why repress your desires?
- I'd like to be in the Indianapolis 500 too, but I have the common sense not to engage in it because it's not good for me.
And that's just what he said-- "it's not good for everybody."
So for you, it wouldn't be good.
The mattress room was the most intense.
And for people who found Plato's really uncomfortable in terms of almost morally, that was the toughest place to go and look.
You would have maybe 200 bodies in there on a busy night and just writhing together like a bucket of worms.
# love today, cry tomorrow # # who's to say # # life is gay... # - "look at that guy's-- he's not really handsome, but look what he's got.
And look what she's got and where is that going?"
It was real and your ears could hear it was real.
Someone-- the breathing and even the smell and the sweat and the-- ugh.
It exhilarated me and at the same time it sort of depressed me.
Because it completely kills your notions about romance.
Like a dance floor, sometimes people are just dancing.
But sometimes there's a groove-- a tribal groove that people get in and be in incredible synch and there would be a lot of energy and it was like that with the mattress room.
I was terrified of the matt room.
And you'd fuck a little and you watch a little and hang out, fuck a little more.
# danger in the shape of something wild #
# stranger dressed in black, she's a hungry child... #
Bacho the disc jockey, he told me, "you're a reporter, right?"
He says, "watch!" he played the music.
He'd speed up the music and the things would go faster.
He slowed down the music and the things would go slower.
It was unbelievable.
You had to be there to see that.
Fast and slow lovemaking.
Ejaculation juices were everywhere.
So I'm sitting on a lot of these wet cushions.
And then on one of these nights I go home and I start feeling really itchy.
"Oooh, what's that?
What is that?"
And then I looked down and I see all these crabs were in there and I just got a big dose of it.
You know, because that's where crabs breed is in all those damp, moist... nether places.
I mean, I just remember a lot of this-- you know, in the mattress room.
# hot child in the city. #
What made you organize-- originate Plato's Retreat,
A place for swinging couples?
- What is the swinging movement?
- It's a couples' movement.
Couples that want to be free-thinking, free-living adult couples.
They don't believe in monogamous relationships.
They would rather get involved with other people but together with their spouses instead of cheating with them.
# I was born with a smile on my face # # the whole of my life's been a pantomime... #
Larry had the pitch and tone of a missionary.
He thought he was the future and he was pulling back the curtain on something wholesome and happy.
I only actually met him once, and I was unable to shake his hand because just before he extended it, he was doing something with it that would tend to make you want to stay several yards away.
# born with a smile on my face... #
Larry said, "I fall in love with every woman
I have sex with, even if I have sex with 10 women a night."
And Larry could have sex with 10 women a night.
He was phenomenal that way.
He said, "It's always romance, it's always exciting and I'm always grateful."
# to have your leisure give you pleasure... #
The thing I mostly remember is he had these giant teeth.
He had really huge teeth.
There's a yiddish word-- hamisch-- and that's what he was.
He was like your nicest uncle.
- A Hugh Hefner.
- A maitre d'.
Larry was... no question a trailblazer.
He was a pioneer in his field.
Quite the guy.
Whether you were in the business, whether you were rich, whatever, Larry always had time for you... especially if you had a great-looking wife.
I think he was lonely.
I think he loved attention.
He loved having people around him, you know?
And he loved being, I guess, you know, the guy with-- the kid with the-- with the baseball bat.
It was his glove, his bat, his ball, you know?
Hi there.
It's Larry and Mary again to tell you about Plato's Retreat, the first and only couples' club of its kind anywhere.
Yes, there's a full-length swimming pool and outrageous whirlpool which holds about 30 people at a time, disco dancing with a live DJ.
I grew up in the upper-middleclass Jewish Catskills of the Concord Hotel.
I was Miss Concord Hotel at 16.
And it seemed to me that all of those people had children, and all those children moved to Long Island, and Southern Jersey.
And all of them went to Plato's.
# when I wake up # # in the morning light... #
The crowd at Plato's was conventional.
It wasn't filled with my friends, but it did a great job in some ways because it sort of liberated Long Island.
It liberated New Jersey.
I never saw a velvet-rope type situation there.
I don't think there might have been a velvet rope.
I never saw an eager crowd waiting to get in with bouncers keeping them out.
Everything at Plato's, even the ugly person--
I don't think there were any-- was-- was-- had a certain charm.
- It was a poor man's playboy mansion.
- Absolutely.
I actually admire people that are that free that could go into a place like that and just let it all hang out, take all their clothes off and walk around-- including those fat people that look like they've got, you know,
double sets of twins in their belly.
I'm amazed that they can do that because even though
I looked a lot different then-- I was skinnier and I had two breasts-- I couldn't take my clothes off in front of strangers.
I mean, I think it takes a lot of something to be able to do that.
# I'll meet ya in the usual place...#
I thought they had resuscitated the orgy
For the man in the street, which is exactly what they did.
You pay whatever it is-- 20, 25 bucks--
You get in and you can join in an orgy.
Where can you do that in the United States?
You could do it at Plato's.
My friends were very... you know, backwards.
And I-
- I grew away from my friends.
I grew away.
I went to the city.
I went to bars.
I went up on Second Avenue, First Avenue, up to Uptown.
I wanted to meet a more educated crowd.
I was no boy scout.
I was a wild guy,
Very uninhibited.
I was a model.
The first time I heard about Plato's Retreat was I went to Club Med at Martinique with a friend of mine and this guy was telling me, "Miles, you're gonna love this place.
It's wild.
Everyone's having sex all over the place."
My boyfriend was a minister.
and he asked me to go to Plato's Retreat that night
And we went.
I was a tingling mess of hormones.
I was like-- almost like when you're a teenager.
As soon as I walked down the stairs, a little redheaded girl comes up to me, really pretty, grabs me by the arm and says, "Come here.
Come with me."
At first we talked to each other for a little bit.
And, um, you know, he was obviously more comfortable there than I was.
We go right into a little private room.
You'll love that.
We're in Plato's Retreat, where everyone's having sex all over the place, there are little rooms called "for the inhibited."
Everybody was so nice to me.
Everybody made you feel at home.
I had a chance to... look around a little bit.
And somewhere in there he disappeared.
And I found myself with a construction worker from Connecticut.
# at Plato's Retreat # # you can make your dreams come true # # fulfill your wildest fantasies # # we've got them all for you... #
She was nuts, absolutely wild.
She goes, "Oooh, pussy loves cock.
Pussy loves cock."
Unbelievable-- a maniac.
I said, "this is my kind of place."
# the pleasure and the fun # # will keep you feeling young # # it's for you # # it's for you... #
I was a young good-looking kid, I guess, and several girls came on to me and their boyfriends weren't that attractive.
and if you had to go with one-- you had to trade off.
And she yelled at me, she screamed at me, and I said, "Just do it!
Just do it."
You know?
And... we didn't talk much after that.
# the pleasure and the fun # # will keep you feeling young # # it's for you # # it's for you... #
He was a wonderful lover.
And I said to myself, "People who come to Plato's Retreat must be pretty good lovers," because this man had been.
Um... # it's for you!
#
I wanted to tell the people I grew up with, like, no, I came from a neighborhood in Queens, New York.
But you couldn't tell-- you couldn't talk about that kind of thing with guys from the neighborhood because they wouldn't believe you.
To be honest, it was going out on an edge for me.
It was a very edgy thing to do to... you know, spend an evening in Plato's Retreat.
There was this attractive mulatto woman going down on her man with her ass up in the air.
I sat down on the mattress next to her and started stroking her.
No opposition, so I--
I guess, you know, stuck my cock in her pussy and screwed her.
And she didn't even look back.
She was too busy blowing her boyfriend.
I hope I'm not being too vulgar.
The minister and I... did hook up sometime during that evening.
But I don't remember when.
- Which is telling.
- Phil?
Yeah-- yes, Larry Levenson, Plato's Retreat.
I can speak for Plato's and we get about 50% new couples every night.
We have disco dancing-- in fact we have a song about Plato's Retreat that's number six in the country right now.
I met people years later who said things like,
"oh, I went in there.
I went to Plato's."
I went to Plato's, you know?
It became part of the memoir.
You know?
That was exciting in itself.
We had judges, lawyers, police--
- Senators.
- Senators.
Robin Leach who was...
He was there just to look.
Students met their professors, guys met their ex-wives, future wives.
Sammy Davis, JR.
on the dance floor at Plato's Retreat, it was a treat.
They'd tell me this guy was a big star--
Frank Sinatra's friend, you know.
- Althea, his wife...
- Althea, his wife.
...pulled her shirt up.
Oh, man, how could I forget his name?
He's a writer-- Hugh Hefner's friend, he committed suicide...
Jerzy Kosinski.
Much of the cast of "Saturday Night Live."
What's his name?
Dreyf-
- Richard Dreyfuss.
He never came down with a lady.
Again he was invited to stay.
Dan Pastorini was having a big year with the Houston Oilers.
And the men recognize him.
And the men started, "It's Dan Pastorini!
It's Dan Pastorini!"
And just immediately grabbing their wives and just-- you know,
"fuck Dan Pastorini!"
Why did you decide in early 1973 to go underground?
There was no way that I could possibly get a fair trial.
Abbie Hoffman was underground, running from the FBI, basically.
And one of these times I got a phone call from him saying, "I'm in town.
And I've been reading all about Plato's in your column in the 'Voice' and I want to go to Plato's Retreat."
And I said, "are you out of your mind?"
This is where we're working on the new constitution.
And he said, "no no no, Igottago .
Igottago.
I gotta go there.
I gotta see it.
I can't miss this."
He comes over after awhile and he says,
"Can't I tell them who I am?
I mean, they-- they-- they just walk away from me.
I thought you said everybody gets laid here."
I said, "go ahead, but I think it's really dangerous."
Abbie was one of the first people that I knew that couldn't get laid at Plato's.
I probably wouldn't have gone as many times as I did, but friends from California kept asking me to walk them in.
I was wondering, do you get a lot of curiosity seekers, people that just like to go and watch?
- Yes, voyeurs, definitely.
- Like me.
Yes, there's no pressure, there's no obligation and no commitment to do anything at our club.
And I'm positive it's the same way at Larry's club.
I come for... sex, good conversation, intellect.
The only rule, actually, in the entire club was no.
If somebody said no, that was it.
But if they allowed it, anything went.
Females first.
They set the rule.
If they want to be touched, that's fine.
They don't want to be touched, they're not gonna be touched.
If she wants to walk around with her top off... she walks around with her top off.
That was it.
I think at Plato's it was kind of interesting that women were really in a position to be assertive, to approach men for sex, to kind of try out a lot of the things that we had been on the receiving end of.
It was yummy.
Why let them have all the pleasure?
Why even pretend that you didn't feel good about it and you didn't have a good time when you were sexually involved?
The whole thing with Plato's is that you would walk into this space, and whether or not you had sex with anyone was really not the point.
The point was is that everybody there was willing to be nude, available maybe for sex and open.
Sex with another man is a fantasy of mine.
I'm someone else.
It's an ego trip.
I think that's exactly what it is.
It's an ego trip having some other man, other than my husband, telling me "you're beautiful.
You're good in bed." all this, you know?
It's really a fantasy for me.
And it also felt like you had a secret, that you had a secret world that most of the people who were either going to work or just going about their business in the city that they didn't know what you had experienced.
Again, it's not just sex.
It's not going in there and say, "I'm going in there 'cause I just want to grab somebody and I wanna..."
Can I say certain words?
Okay.
"...get laid."
I was a social worker in 1978.
But I had good evenings after my social work.
# oh, how happy # # you have made me # # oh, how happy # # you have made me #
# I have kissed your lips # # a thousand times... #
I remember once, this couple--
I'm sure they've been thrown out of every swingers club in the world because they were so large.
They had to weigh 300 lbs each.
And they were jitterbugging.
They were dancing.
They had on their towels.
They had to have double towels around them.
And the towels, of course, fell off.
And then nobody gave a doo-doo-caca.
But what happened was-- it was when they stomped, they were shaking the-- the-- the-- the Platters for the DJ because they weighed so much.
I mean, they were shaking the whole damn floor.
But it was-- nobody cared.
It was really very very nice.
This was Larry Levenson's castle.
Plato's Retreat was the way that Larry could embrace everybody and-- and-- exude his generosity, his bounty.
Family togetherness today at a place called Plato's Retreat.
This afternoon the owner held an open house there for children.
In most cases it was a family affair at Plato's today...
The first time I actually went to the club, the club was closed.
My father used to run, like, holiday parties--
Memorial Day, Labor Day.
He would actually rent the big bus, have it parked at my high school.
I would invite 40 of my best friends.
- Do you mind that yourmothercomeshere?
- No, I don't care.
He had a disco and there was a game room there.
Everything was the same as if it was open, except there was no nudity or no sex.
It was a bunch of kids.
That's when we started understanding what everything was about.
He used to be called-- what?
King of Swing.
Yeah, that's right.
He was called King of Swing.
# at Plato's Retreat... #
Larry, let us into your heart a minute.
A lot of people are saying Larry Levenson, a lot of people say sleaze.
I heard the President's speech the other night.
He talked about truth, service, sacrifice, the American dream.
And then we see in this country a disintegration of the American family--
That's what you're really telling us.
That's what Plato's Retreat
- is about-- or monogamy is dead.
- Oh no.
- No!
- I'm saying that--
This is a preservation in a sense, Stanley.
Don't you realize how many men say
"I'm going out with the boys tonight,"
- And they cheat and they lie?
- The question is why aren't you in jail?
We're here at the New York Aquarium now.
- Watching orca Shamu do his thing.
Larry, you know, I've never really gotten a chance to talk to you.
Why don't you play with my ass and tell me your philosophy of life?
Whoo!
- Oh my god, he's doing it.
- Larry got involved withyoungerwomen, wanted to hang out with these women that took him for his money-- the money he didn't have and the drugs he did have.
Larry was boring because he thought his whole world was sex.
His world was genitalia.
Again, he never read a book.
He never had a thought.
It was all about him as a legend.
He really thought that when it came to swinging he was-- everyone looked at him as "The King" literally.
We got people from Fort Lauderdale.
We got people from California.
We got people from Paris, France, coming to Plato's.
They fly in.
We're the eighth wonder of the world.
Okay?
I think it's different, but I don't think it's immoral.
This is the biggest thing to hit New York city since the World's Fair.
And it is.
The interesting thing about Larry was
The guy was getting social security checks.
He didn't have any money, yet he was able to borrow $150,000.
Where does a guy get $150,000?
He was Colonel Sanders and he had to do his little step--
Step-and-fix-it routine.
Is it your view we're gonna have Plato's Retreats-- it's gonna be part of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, too someday?
Within the next three months there will be four more Plato's Retreats around the country.
Larry started to believe the bullshit.
I bullshit all the time when I'm interviewing.
Larry did too, but Larry exaggerated the importance.
I always argued, "It's just fucking."
What is fucking?
It's friction.
You believe in a free society?
A free society where people can just have a good time and enjoy themselves the way they want to, without hurting anybody else.
It's a devastating therapy.
- But it works for them.
- Is it for them?
I saw a fight between a couple there at Plato's once where the husband had found out that his wife had mended the pants for a man who was there.
And in fact they'd had sex many times, but it was this little personal touch that showed affection that made the husband insane.
I could never bring somebody special, somebody I cared about there.
I couldn't handle my wife or my girlfriend being with somebody else.
And me sitting and watching?
You really did see that sometimes that what they came out for bit them in the behind.
They got more than what they really bargained for.
If I wanted to have an affair with a man or sleep with a man that I felt attractive, I can do it.
And Michael knows about it.
It's like dual infidelity.
Do you think Larry is faithful to you out of Plato's Retreat?
For example, is he with other women, do you think?
- Yes, very definitely.
- How do you know?
- I don't have time.
- Trust.
I believe Mary...
Always had feelings for Larry.
I think her whole life was wrapped around him, wrapped around the lifestyle.
Most people look at Plato's as the new sexual lifestyle of the 21st century.
Honestly what most people feel--
I know this is another judgment-- they feel something's gone wrong here.
Well, maybe something has.
Maybe every marriage in this country has a little something wrong with it.
She knew the people.
She knew the crowd.
And I think, like anything else, too much of something could freak you out.
There was no Mary room.
There was no... fancy room where Mary could sit up there and be queen and men would come and court her.
They seemed to have a respectful relationship for a time.
I don't have much more to add about that.
No, I don't remember much more-- same.
- Are you married?
- No, uh...
- We were-
- I was--
- Are you married?
--in strictly monogamous relationships.
- In a sense--
- You don't hear me.
--In a sense, David, we are married because I intend to spend the rest of my life with Larry whether he likes it or not, but, uh...
- But technically no?
- Technically no, we're not.
What is the address of the new Plato's and what is the opening date?
The grand opening will be December 5th, on a Friday night at 9:00 P.M.
That's of this year, of course.
When the 34th street location opened, it was hopping.
This is the matt room.
This is a place where you get 20, 30 couples in here at one time.
You must be undressed to come in here.
It's a beautiful sight.
It was located directly across from McDonald's.
And people used to say it had become the McDonald's of sex.
I was this normal housewife person.
My husband left, his girlfriend was having a baby.
And you meet different people.
I was working at the movie theater in the village.
I was selling the tickets to "Rocky Horror."
And the first time I went to Plato's, it seemed people-- like actually doing something in the open, you just-- you don't believe what you saw.
Because it was like turning a page in a magazine and you're sitting there and then you make up your mind.
You know, you're either into it or you're not.
And I was into it.
One time I was standing there by the ladies' room in the back and a young girl came up to me, and she said to me, "are you outrageous?"
And I said, "yes, I am." and with that I put my hand on her breast.
She said, "perhaps you'd like to join us?"
I said, "oh, thank you very much"
and I was invited to go in this room with seven other ladies.
Another time I was there with a young gentleman and he knew this couple:
The lady was Chinese, the husband was a white gentleman.
And he said to me, "You want to do something with them?
The husband doesn't do anything.
He just sits in the corner.
We could be with the lady, the three of us."
And I said okay.
And the husband just sat there in the corner.
Like touching his wife's shoulder, but not joining in.
I was going to be President of the P.T.A.
What do you want out of your life that you're not getting from Mary?
That I am not getting from Mary?
There is no man in the world that can say that his woman gives him every need that he has-- that there is to have.
I want as much as I can possibly have in this lifetime.
And that's what I'm doing.
I'm enjoying myself,
I'm happy and that's the bottom line.
One of his constant refrains whenever he was interviewed or talked to anybody was swinging and Plato's will not save a bad marriage.
It's something extra you do in a great marriage for fun.
As swinging was explained to me by him when I was a kid was:
There is no jealousy.
You know?
Swinging is a thing where couples are in a relationship with each other.
Okay?
They have feelings for each other as if non-swingers do.
But the only difference is that when they're with someone else, it's just sex.
There's no feelings.
I never saw him going around with Mary.
I never saw them having sex with other couples.
It was always Larry.
Do you have relationships with other men there?
- Occasionally, yes.
- Does he know about it?
Yes.
- Do you countenance it?
- I think it's fantastic.
Mary would be having a lot of men.
You weren't really supposed to have a gangbang just out on the main floor.
You were supposed to go somewhere, and Larry might speak to Mary about it, and then he'd go off and-- ohhh-- you know, and say, "Mary's upset."
We'd say, "Mary doesn't look upset.
Mary looks like she's having a good time."
"No, Mary's upset."
She was losing Larry, not just to the lifestyle, but to one particular woman or another.
Do you really believe that you can make love to a person one time and fall in love with them?
I don't think it can happen.
I really don't.
I've never seen it happen.
He was there just to have sex.
The whole thing was how many women he could get.
She wasn't having it and I don't blame her.
So she went on with this affair with the chauffeur.
Mary and Larry were-- were--
He was starting to tell her to stay home, and the chauffeur knew both of them because he used to drive both of them to Plato's.
It ended badly.
They wanted to kill each other.
The chauffeur was in love with Mary.
Larry was in love with Mary.
Mary was in love with the chauffeur-- it was this big nasty triangle.
- Larry would send Mary home with Ron.
- Yeah.
So maybe one thing led to another.
I think in the end he...
The chauffeur had Larry kidnapped, beaten to a pulp, sent-- put in the hospital in an effort to end it in his favor.
That's what I believe happened.
- I never seen a guy that was beat--
- So beat up.
- I mean--
- His face was like out to here.
I think Larry Levenson wound up in the hospital in Queens stemming from this conflict between him, Mary and the chauffeur.
After the kidnapping, Mary came by the club a couple of times.
You know, she seemed basically out of it.
You know, she was older and at one point she might have been the queen, but she definitely wasn't now.
She almost wound up on the street.
She was institutionalized, I believe, at Bellevue for a while and she did have a breakdown.
She was really a nice woman.
Nice lady.
Maybe they made up that story that it was this guy
- to stay away from the wiseguys.
- Ron.
We don't know.
Why it happened, we never knew.
But even then Larry was running around, like, in a wheelchair and he was perfectly fine.
He was saying, "Aw, it's nothing."
I'll be fine.
I'll be walking." and he was.
He was, like, smiling through it all.
Plato's Retreat is an unlicensed club
- for swinging couples, right?
- We have a charter.
In approximately July of 1979, there had been some newspaper article wherein Larry Levenson had stated and boasted that,
"We don't pay taxes for Plato's Retreat Inc."
We are definitely a non-profit corporation.
- Now wait a minute, Larry.
What do you mean a non-profit?
- I'm telling you.
Two gentlemen appeared 9:00 in the morning.
I'm half asleep.
And they says, "We came here to see the books."
So I gave them the books.
I didn't know they were from the Internal Revenue.
And they find out they got a gold mine in front of them, that these people have been cheating their income tax for three years.
In one year I think they claimed only $300 of taxable income and paid zero tax.
Ann Grippo reentered the business room.
She looked over our shoulder and was peering intently.
She just blurted out voluntarily,
"we're dead."
I tried to take the books away from them.
- Yeah?
- And I did, I took the books.
They didn't keep them.
They weren't allowed to keep them.
- Correct.
- I took them.
- But now they know that they have--
- Wait.
- So now you got the books back in your hand.
- Yeah.
- Did you call Larry?
- When they came in that night I told them what happened.
- You didn't do nothing tillthatnight?
- No, till that night.
Hy said to me, "You know, I covered our tracks here for three years.
Now we're dead."
There was nothing I could say or do except that, "hey, I'm sorry."
When they came home that night, they packed their bags and they were gone.
They were so terrified that they were gonna get whacked.
I didn't hear from them again--
It's funny.
I laugh because when I saw them again it was on TV.
Come on up here, Grippos.
Charlie and Ann Grippo.
Welcome.
What did you yell, Charlie, when you were running up here?
- We're coming!
- We're coming and we'll getitright if it takes us all night.
He went onto some kind of quiz show in Vegas.
"Las Vegas Gambit."
- You're from where?
- New York City.
- On vacation?
- Yes.
I don't think we're sitting there five minutes.
Yeah, just about five minutes we heard--
We get two cards and it's blackjack.
- And you get $1,000.
- And we win $1200.
Or $1,000.
She jumps up...
We're gonna send you the tape.
Funny as hell.
Hysterical.
Baby, baby.
And I thought to myself,
"these guys are running from the mob and here they are advertising who they--"
- We got a trip to the Super Bowl.
- A washer-dryer.
And what about the V.C-- not a V.C.R., that--
- A Betamax.
- The Betamax.
- We won a load of stuff.
- A load of stuff.
It was a trial.
On trial was Larry,
Hy, Frank, the accountant.
Larry took the stand and tried to explain the circumstances.
He believed that he was in a-- a non-profit, not-for-profit club and that he truly believed that.
Larry Levenson wasn't on the stand.
He was on the stage.
Everything was a joke to him, or so it appeared.
I think the jury, as I recall, was laughing at him.
The trial was completed.
The jury deliberated for approximately five or six hours, I believe.
And came back with guilty verdicts.
Larry Levenson, Frank Pernice, Hy Gordon received eight years plus a fine.
I think an eight-year jail sentence at that time for this type of a tax evasion was something of a record.
What fucked him up was he was stealing cash.
And he did the dumbest thing of all.
If any of you ever do cash or have your own company, you don't do it in front of employees, 'cause the guy who's working for you or the gal who's working for you, you're gonna fire them or yell at them and they're gonna bring you down.
A lot of cash-- just like Studio 54!
I don't believe he was stealing money,
I don't believe that he was creating books that-- didn't exist.
I mean--
Double books?
Larry was being King of Swing.
The demeanor at the defense table changed.
All of a sudden there was silence upon the announcement of the verdict.
There was no more affable, class-clown Larry Levenson.
It was total silence.
If you break the law, there's
"If ya can't affords the time, ya don't commits the crime."
True.
# happiness, happiness # # the greatest gift that I possess #
# I thank the lord that I've been blessed... #
Some of you may have been wondering whatever happened to Larry Levenson?
He's here in Allenwood, which is a federal penitentiary.
It's considered a level-one prison.
In the trunk we'd have clothes, suitcases, golf clubs, a tennis racket.
We thought it was a place where you basically just-- you hung out but you couldn't leave.
The lack of sex-- very rarely discussed or anything.
Everybody takes care of that situation by themselves, you know?
We were in constant communication.
- And he never complained about it, right?
- Right.
# the greatest gift that I possess #
"Larry Levenson, you're okay, even though you've gone away.
You got into an awful mess.
You just can't fuck with the I.R.S."
Plato's without Larry was like Easter at the Vatican without the Pope.
The Pope had this tracheotomy and the Christians are running amok.
Without Larry, Plato's took a big dive.
And it wasn't Plato's anymore.
It wasn't-- it wasn't even wholesome anymore.
You know?
Because without that benevolent heart behind it, it was just a tacky swingers club, you know?
It required a lot more people to fill the place.
So they had special parties-- sometimes they would have kinky nights.
I, uh, use the...
Uh, the Pussy Propulsion which is the basis for all space travel.
Belle du jour presents an SM costume ball and dinner party.
Do they have to be in costume?
Not necessarily, but it would be fun.
I'm here every Tuesday and it starts at 8:15.
And I fulfill all their fantasies in SM... and all erotic fantasies.
Sounds good to me.
I'm Danny the wonder pony.
I give women pony rides.
I dance in a fashion that makes them look and feel like they're riding a pony,
Except to the music.
And if you've ever watched a woman ride a horse, it's very erotic.
He had foxy boxing, which was girls fighting each other.
Okay, stick around.
Next match coming soon.
The amusing part of that is in between each round the girls would throw up in a bucket.
There were brothers and sisters.
Those things weren't as taboo as they are now.
# if you like what we're doing when we're doing what we're doing # # come on, clap your hands # # if you like what we're doing when we're doing what we're doing #
# hey-yyyy!
#
I remember they had girls up there--
I think they were porno stars-- performing, doing musical feats.
# party party # # party party... #
And there were men in the audience who were masturbating-- if my memory serves me correct.
Don't you, on certain levels, feel that swinging sort of has shot its load?
That it's a tired phenomena that dates back more to the '60s and '70s?
- And for the '80s nobody really gives a shit?
- No, on the contrary.
I think swinging is just now really coming into its own.
While Larry was in jail he did these little weekly announcements that were really cute.
What about your job?
- Did you say you worked in the sewer system?
- Yeah.
We would set up a tape recorder that was attached to the telephone.
He wants to be heard from prison or no.
- What do you do?
- I test the...
The garbage, what?
Do you eat it?
Yeah, the waste and everything.
No, the amoeba eats it.
He had senators there with him.
He had judges there with him.
He had lawyers there with him.
It was not a terrible place to be.
When that water goes into the river, you can actually drink it.
# happiness!
#
I got a phone call from a friend of mine who says, "you're not going to believe this.
I just heard on the radio that the King of Swing is home from prison."
I just want to say now, ladies and gentlemen, that I am more than proud to present for the first time back here in 32 months, the man responsible for creating Plato's Retreat, ladies and gentlemen, the owner, the creator
of Plato's Retreat, the King of Swing,
Mr. Larry Levenson.
Come right out, gang.
Okay, Larry Levenson, skinnier, his dick is bigger.
Here he is, Larry, back from 32 months of homosexuality.
What's it like to be here at the place, the dream you created?
You know, the person who doesn't know how to answer you.
- You're such a slob.
- We're here with his lovely mother Renee.
Renee, how do you feel that your son broke out of prison and is here at Plato's today?
I should have expected something like this from you, Al.
I'm not the least bit surprised.
It's not true you called the parole board and said, "keep the bastard"?
No, you did that, honey.
You were a little mixed up.
# and you try to show # # your love for me. #
I'm thrilled to no end right now as I look around and see you friendly faces, faces of old friends and soon-to-be new friends.
To you members that frequent Plato's, our club is much more than a sexual haven.
We are the closest thing to a family here.
I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna make this club better than ever, and we're gonna have more fun than ever and it's just gonna be beautiful.
Larry, we welcome you back and congratulations on completing the 32-month Allenwood diet.
Everything hits a peak, so there was a peak for sexuality.
There was a peak for disco.
# karma karma karma karma karma chameleon... #
The club was in a decline and so was Larry.
Were we distressed about it?
Yes.
Come down and fulfill your most fantastic fantasies and stimulate your wildest dreams.
# oh yes, it's ladies' night # # and the feeling's right... #
Is it going to be ladies' night every Monday, do you know?
Ladies' night, 6:00-9:00;
then 9:00 the men come in.
They would have at Plato's singles nights to kind of introduce people who never swung before.
# oh yes, it's ladies' night # # oh, what a night, oh, what a night... #
There'd be stripper after stripper and the women are getting wilder and wilder.
Then 9:00, or a couple of hours later, the men-- the single men would be allowed in.
And these guys were horny fucks.
Then what they'd do though, they'd have to have a lot more girls that would be like girls that would be hired.
But you couldn't necessarily separate the prostitutes from the wives because the wives were kind of doing themselves up like prostitutes often.
There was coke everywhere.
And everybody used it to stay awake, to keep going, for this, that and the other thing, to feel better.
Stay up, keep going,
Don't stop.
I'm gonna have fun.
Prostitution was the tail that wagged the dog.
Because I believe 40%-50% of the girls there every night, with their, quote, date, were hookers.
And I know that to be a fact because the hookers advertised in "screw."
I remember I met an African-American woman and we went into the back and we went into one of the rooms and the next thing she stuck her hand out and she wanted money from me.
And I just didn't have it, you know?
She said, "Well, I'm sorry."
There was just this-- a sense of impending doom.
But I don't know how much we talked about it.
It lost the warmth.
And that wasn't, I think, just the steam rising off of all that water they had going in there.
It was moving towards that point in the '80s when sex was terrifying.
# I've just closed my eyes again... #
AIDS reduces the number of helper cells in the blood.
Therefore the body has no way of either detecting or attacking certain infections.
# driver, take away my worries of today... #
When AIDS first hit, nobody even knew what it was yet.
No one quite knew how it was transmitted.
- No one knew how to have safe sex.
- # dream Weaver #
# I believe you can get me through the night... #
The people who cared about their lives stopped going to sex clubs.
And so you got a more hardcore, self-destructive
- group of people.
- # Dream Weaver. #
All this talk about AIDS, aren't you worried about it?
Being with so many different men?
Larry, I've never heard of a woman that has contacted AIDS through sexual intercourse.
I went from one extreme to the other, saying "this is not something you get a shot for, or take a pill for.
This is your life.
- And you need to rethink your priorities in life." -
And I say god was kind and I was spared.
Some other people were not that lucky.
That 73% of the AIDS cases are in homosexuals, this is put out by the State of New York, Dr. Axelrod.
Wait, let me-- let me finish.
Sir-- sir, let me finish.
It was like a ghost town.
For about 30 days, it was like nobody.
Everybody was just scared.
They didn't even know if you could get it mouth to mouth.
The St. Marks Bathhouse was shut down after undercover inspectors reported that they had observed
49 acts of high-risk sexual activity involving more than 80 people.
Only medical science can ever truly defeat AIDS.
I think that Koch, who I admired, wanted to bust down on the gay clubs.
To make things even, he busted down on Plato's.
They said that AIDS did go through Plato's Retreat.
No, they came down and interviewed me.
And that's all they did.
And we found out since that with the smell of chlorine in the air at Plato's Retreat, the AIDS virus does not have a chance.
It just happens to be a factual thing.
One of the key parts of the effort would be to collect evidence, which if it was necessary, if it became necessary to seek to close a place down, this is the kind of evidence that would hold up in court.
Larry had signs posted.
And he has his security that are walking around actually telling people,
"Wait till this little thing is over with.
But right now, we can't allow anal sex, we can't allow oral sex on a guy."
The law prohibits anal sex and fellatio.
- Excuse me?
- You can have sexual intercourse legally on Plato's premises.
Hello?
Some of the inspectors were so... uh, overwhelmed-- distressed by what they saw that they needed actually counseling and counseling was provided.
"Government of the people, for the people and by the people should not perish from this earth."
Now Mr. Koch is trying to tell me that the people have nothing to do with government.
It's like a war.
You're fighting the city.
I want to talk to the fat guy on the right.
There are two fat guys here.
Which one?
On the right?
Go ahead, fat guy.
- What do you have to say?
- Do you suck?
Oh, you're a moron.
Good evening.
Plato's Retreat is the latest casualty in New York's war on dangerous sex.
Inspectors would come in and they described what to us seemed like prostitution activities.
In its prime, thousands of heterosexual couples flocked to Plato's Retreat.
But the party came to a halt at the well-known nightclub.
Minutes before its scheduled opening, city officials closed the venue on charges of prostitution.
The city knows as everybody else knows we never allowed prostitution on our premises, and I always say that we never will.
So we went in there and the judge signed the preliminary injunction.
It went to an appellate court and the appellate court changed the temporary closing order.
- Hello, you're on the air.
- Yeah, hi.
Um, can you tell me what the status of the club is right now?
And, um... is it still closed or what are they doing at this point?
- At Plato's, you mean, sir?
- Yes, sir.
Plato's Retreat is now open.
The place is reopened and we send inspectors in there again.
And within a short period of time, the inspectors are coming back and they're saying, "forget about prostitution now.
We're seeing high-risk sexual activities."
Starting tonight for the next year, all profits made by Plato's Retreat, will be donated to AIDS research.
Two weeks later, New Year's Eve, boof!
We get closed for good.
Tonight the city closed Plato's Retreat, that notorious heterosexual sex club on Manhattan's West Side.
Plato's Retreat is more than just a club.
It's an institution.
It's a monument to sexual freedom.
And they set us back 50 years.
Plato's was then closed on December 31st.
And actually, it never reopened after that.
I remember driving up at 7:30 and seeing the door padlocked with the police tape on it.
And... there was no notice, no nothing.
They didn't tell anyone that we're going to be closing you down.
They just came on New Year's Eve.
I think it was to spank them.
Larry's really really upset.
He's almost holding back tears.
You could see it.
Because now he knows that the city just crippled him and he's looking at the future.
He goes, "I can't stay open, Ron.
The money I made from New Year's Eve was going to keep me going with rent."
Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.
Everything fell apart:
All the connections, the phone calls-- everything stopped.
We have no meeting ground anymore.
We have no home for the family anymore.
So everybody takes off to different areas.
Everybody goes back to real life.
From what I could see, most clubs in Manhattan lasted a few years.
They'd be really hot, maybe six, eight, 10 years and then they'd close down.
And people were on to the new club.
I think Plato's kind of died a natural death actually.
It might have had a little help.
It was a different era then with everything that was going on.
A place like that...
It wasn't going to last anyway.
A lot of people...
Just couldn't-- don't like the lifestyle so they put it down, like our mayors and our governors.
But meanwhile they're the ones in here.
It was like, "We should all sing 'Old Lang Sone'--"
"Old Lang..."
- "Syne."
- Whatever.
"--'Old Lang whatever.'"
After the club closed
I think that's when it took him over completely.
I think that's when Larry really fell into hard times--
No finances.
Tonight we're talking with Larry Levenson.
Larry was the owner of Plato's Retreat.
Plato's Retreat was the largest swing club in New York.
He was the original prototype swinger.
That was his life.
That was why he started the club.
And basically the club ended because of that narcissism.
You start believing it and you think you can do no wrong and you're gonna beat the system.
Larry was depressed.
And I'd visit him in his apartment in Brooklyn and he'd be doing crack cocaine.
And he's sweating-- "Larry, you're sweating like a pig.
It doesn't look like you're having fun."
He goes, "trust me.
It's a nice feeling and it takes away the pain."
He went to parents without partners and he was enjoying that and meeting lots of different people.
And he did meet Marilyn there.
- I just got engaged last week.
- Mazel tov.
- A beautiful young lady, yeah.
- Mazel tov.
- Yeah, I'm very happy.
- And she's sweet woman.
She is wonderful.
And the whole point is what do I want to do with my life?
Don't know how long it was good.
I do remember one incident where he asked me to go to the house and pick up a check.
He got divorced again, so now... now he's back to being single and he's back in Brooklyn again.
Remember he was driving a cab?
He was driving a cab, I remember that.
# I still get that same old feeling # # tearing at this heart of mine... #
I hailed a yellow cab.
I got in.
and sometimes I have a habit of looking at the hack license.
When my dad had the club, he had all the friends.
Everybody wanted to hang out with him.
Then when he didn't have the club, they were gone.
I saw the name Larry Levenson.
And I kept saying, "Larry Levenson, Larry Levenson?
That's the man who owned Plato's."
You have to pick and choose who your friends are.
And you have to stay grounded.
I think my dad was never grounded.
I thought that we were a great family.
And I really believed, truly, that we were a community.
But I guess I was mistaken.
It was me...
that felt that.
I was the king.
One day he invited us to Brooklyn to see his house.
And he lived down in the basement because...
The brick building, he rented upstairs--
I guess the two floors.
And I was shocked the way he lives down in the basement with cats and everything.
It both-- my mind-- how could he live in a basement?
Then he took us out for a nice lobster dinner.
He had just gone through heart surgery.
He was in the hospital.
We were living down here.
He had had a heart attack.
He was in the intensive care unit.
I brought some flowers for his nurses.
He seemed in good spirits.
When I heard that Larry Levenson died from a heart attack and that he'd become a cab driver
I just thought, "wow, that was just so hard to reconcile that the king of Plato's Retreat
Could end up like a broken-down old hack."
I just remember getting a phone call that Larry's passed away.
I was pretty miserable for quite a while.
It was one of the ones that really hurt.
When Larry started Plato's,
We were still in that period where sex wasn't just sex and pleasure, it was also about kind of revolution, a breaking with the past.
I think the only difference between Larry and many men in our society and culture is that Larry didn't hesitate to talk about it and tell the truth about it, how he actually felt.
I wonder how many men hide how they really feel about sex.
Or how many men would have the courage to say
"I want to do them all"?
Every time I drive by the club, even to this day,
I still feel the magic.
Look at it, the lights are still here.
Oh, there's disco lights over there.
The sprinkler system was here.
There's our fan, still up there to this day.
Whatever Frankie built, it's still there.
So... amazing.
One thing about getting older is that you don't want to look back and say
"Wow, really I'm sorry I didn't do that.
I really am sorry I missed that.
I really am sorry I didn't take advantage of that."
I'm an old lady with no regrets, because I'll tell you:
Those-- that period was very special.
It was the same routine every night but different bodies.
Different sizes.
Tall, short--
It was, you know, a sight to see...
Every night.
Somehow whenever anybody discusses Plato's Retreat, they do it with a smile on their face.
If anybody was there, they're happy.
If anybody wasn't there, they're only sorry that they didn't get an opportunity to go there and see it.
It was very exciting to a lot of people.
And when we finally caught up with it, we were amused by it as well.
I'm-
- I'm really glad I went.
I'm glad to have the experience of having gone.
Just as I'm glad that I got to the top of the World Trade Center once.
Even to today people say things to me:
"I knew your father.
I remember your father."
Okay, some people, they have no memories.
They had a boring normal...
Let's say everyday-straight kind of life.
I've led a different kind of life.
I've had that life and my life changed...
By going to Plato's... by getting into open sex.
These are things that you never thought you would ever do in life.
You didn't even think about it.
So a lot of people, they don't have those memories.
I have those memories.
I can see the faces in front of me now.
It was good for me.
it was good for me.
It was great for me.
Is Larry still around, by the way?
- Are you guys talking to Larry?
- He passed away in '99.
- He passed away?
- Yeah.
- He was only about 50.
- 62.
Wow.
# oh, how happy # # you have made me # # oh, how happy # # you have made me #
# I have kissed your lips # # a thousand times # # and more times than I can count #
# I have called you mine # # you have stood... #
I tried to hide the fact
That Larry Levenson was my brother.
after all, my name was Karen Posner.
It wasn't too difficult, I thought, to keep it a secret.
But of course everybody knew because of the car showing up at the house and Larry marching into all of our backyard barbecues.
I saw people getting down in various stages.
Big deal.
What did you expect?
Where do you expect babies come from?
I wouldn't just take my clothes off and just walk around like that.
You know?
Have I done anything there?
I really can't talk about that... if I've ever done anything there.
What is the difference between parsley and pussy?
He says, "What is the difference?" I says,
"Well, who eats parsley?"
One of Larry's ideas was that he seriously believed that he could have sex with every single woman in New York and I was going to help him do it.
What do you say to something like that?
We laugh.
That's what keeps a marriage going sometimes is laughter.
I mean he makes me laugh, I make him laugh.
- And now we have a new life.
- Uh uh uh!
Yeah, but now we got a new life.
- But uh uh uh.
- No, home.
Oh yeah.
Our poker life.
Now we can't wait to get back to Vegas in December.
Go ahead.
What else?
#...
Made me # # you have made me # # you have made me # # you have made me. #

Is this Sage Baker?
Speaking.
Nigel Barker told me
I need to be in the Sage and Rose business.
We are having lunch with Patricia Kingston tomorrow!
Who's Patricia Kingston?
Huge publicist!
Part of the reason that I wanted to work here
Was so that I could meet people that were worth writing about.
Who's more accomplished than Laurel?
You're writing an unauthorized biography of Laurel?
I did something bad.
What did you do?
I decided to do more research on Laurel.
What did you find ?
I can't tell you
Well, maybe you shouldn't tell her.
If I could turn back time and unlearn what I learned, I would.
What do you want from me?
I don't want anything from you.
Well, let's see how honorable you really are.
Episode 09
- All About Insecurities
Today is finally here!
You nearly cost me my eyebrows.
I'm sorry, I've just been waiting for today for so long, and now it's finally here.
And quite frankly, it could not have come at a better time.
My best friend from Yale is flying in from New York today.
Her name is Caryn, and you're going to love her.
Well, I'm only starting to love you.
Let's not muddy the waters.
We were roommates all four years.
We were both scholarship students in the honors journalism program.
Anyway, now she works as an assistant at the Finley Review
Ooh, fancy.
Mm-hmm.
And we've both been so busy, we haven't seen each other in forever.
It'll be nice to finally have someone to commiserate with.
Marco, I need to see the final menu for the shareholder's dinner.
Marco: right away.
Morning, Laurel.
You can bring it into my office.
And the hate continues.
No, it's just a phase.
She goes through that with everyone.
It'll pass.
Ah, I'm not so sure this one will.
Mmm, not that she doesn't have a reason to be angry at me, but... you ever gonna tell me why?
Nope.
Ooh, good, you're here!
See, that's the kind of greeting I like.
Danke.
So my friend Caryn is flying in from New York and she's gonna stay with me for a couple of days, and I was hoping you could show us some of that rich-ass Palm Beach livin'.
You know, maybe we could take a spin on of your yachts tomorrow afternoon.
How many yachts do you think I have?
Ok, well, if the yacht's unavailable, we'll go for a ride on your horses or elephants.
You're the billionaire, you tell me what's going on.
As much as I'd love to take you ladies out for a spin on the Davis family elephants, sorry to say that I'm working this week.
You're what?
I'm working.
Didn't it ever occur to you that I might have a job?
Uh, no.
But that's probably 'cause I've known you for four months, and you never mentioned you had one, but I'm silly like that.
I work for Peter Friedland.
He's a sports photographer.
Hey, like you.
Like me... except he gets paid and published and all that good stuff.
He does mostly freelance, so whenever he's doing something in town, he hires me to get his coffee, do his bidding and absorb his genius.
You do coffee runs?
You are blowin' my mind here, William.
Yeah, well... tomorrow he's giving me a really cool break, actually.
There's this charity tennis tournament over in west Palm, and he's gonna let me cover it and critique my work.
Really?
That's amazing.
I can probably score you and your friend some seats if you want.
The Brian Brothers are playing.
Well, that would be great.
I mean, if the safari's unavailable.
You know I don't really own any elephants, right?
I don't know!
Hey, girls.
Big week next week.
Finals are just around the corner.
We gotta get serious.
First up is English lit.
Aww, yeah!
Do you know that since you moved into this house,
I actually look forward to going to school every morning.
Aw, thanks, Sage.
Not a compliment.
Ok, well, you don't have to worry about me finishing it, because I am so loving "A Farewell To Arms".
And I'm only a few chapters in, but I'm already picturing James Franco as Frederick.
How hot would that be?
Oh, so hot.
And I'm glad you like it.
That's really great, Rose.
Yeah, well, some of the vocab's a little tough, but I'm using that online dictionary you showed me.
And it's really making a big difference.
Oh, good, 'cause when we get around to SAT stuff, that's really gonna be helpful--
Oh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
You're here!
I'm here!
Yay!
Hi!
Come on.
Give me your stuff, give me your stuff.
Oh, my god!
I cannot believe you actually live here now!
I am in awe.
And I am in awe of your outfit.
Thanks!
Not a compliment.
Why do people just assume?
Uh, Caryn, this is Rose and Sage Baker.
Girls, this is Caryn, my best friend from Yale.
Oh, nice to meet you.
You, too.
Yeah.
Let's go, Rose.
We're going to be late.
Bye.
Do you realize that one pair of their shoes would, like, pay my rent for a month?
I don't mean to make you sad, but a half a pair of those shoes would cover it.
Oh, sorry.
Hang on.
Ugh, it's work.
You wanna answer it?
No, I'm gonna call back later.
My boss is being such a nightmare.
I don't think he understands the concept of vacation.
Yeah, my boss hasn't exactly been a joy to be around lately, either.
I thought you loved your boss.
I did.
I mean, I do.
Uh... it just got weird.
Oh.
It sounds like a good, old-fashioned bitch session is in order.
Yes, yes.
A million times yes.
Oh, actually, that's my stuff.
Oh, no, no, don't worry.
That's Rami.
He's the butler.
Oh.
Hi, Rami the butler.
Do not hug me.
Ok.
A butler with space issues.
Come on, let me show you around.
Ok.
Ok, then, what about the perfume idea?
We love perfume.
Mmm, we can't do anything with make-up.
It's too close to Laurel.
We don't want this to seem like a nepotism situation.
Plus, I promised my tutor no publicizing until after 3 p.m.
Hmm, girls.
Here's the sit-I-ation.
You've definitely got the "it" factor, and you may be a big deal here on rich people island, but you cross that bridge, nobody's ever heard of you.
Well, that sucks.
Well, I mean, not necessarily.
I mean, it just means we can make you into anything.
We just have to start somewhere.
Anywhere.
Anything.
Do you blog?
Ugh.
You know, the little one's getting on my nerves.
We don't mean to be picky.
It's just, we've all seen how these things can go.
I mean, a regional print ad, some bad reality TV, and then Perez catches you with a drink in your hand and your 15 minutes are up.
Are you kidding?
What 15 minutes?
Most crazies get a full primetime hour these days.
But we want more than that.
We want longevity; a career.
I mean, look at Madonna.
That woman is literally a hundred years old, and she's still relevant.
That's what we want.
Yes, but Queen Esther, she arrived on the scene with a clear, definable skill, all right?
You have to give me something to work with.
Rose can sing.
Mmm!
Yeah, I can.
And Sage is practically an expert at the guitar.
Yeah.
Eric Clapton has a house next to ours in Turks and Caicos.
He taught me all kinds of stuff.
Well, how come you didn't mention this before?
We didn't think it mattered.
Well, it certainly makes my job easier.
Do you have something I can listen to?
Um, yeah, Laurel, she bought us a day at the recording studio for our sweet 16.
I can bring you a copy of the single we cut.
Good.
And I can get you Eric's number if you need it.
Mmm, yeah, no thanks.
I have it.
All right, good.
Give me some time to work this new angle out, and I will get back to you, all right?
Ciao, bellas.
Our first professional meeting.
I feel so business-y.
I know.
Maybe we should hire an assistant.
I can't believe you pulled the plug on the whole Laurel book.
I thought it was such a great idea.
I know, I know, and I was having so much fun with it, but then things got off-track with Laurel.
Which I still don't understand.
I mean, the book was basically a love letter to her.
It's complicated.
And now I just feel totally stalled.
Oh, I know.
I spend most of my time making copies, and when I'm not doing that, I'm going on coffee runs for my boss and making sure the Deli doesn't put too much mustard on his pastrami sandwich.
I'm so glad I got my ivy league degree.
Oh, Laurel.
Um, this is my friend Caryn.
Would you like to explain this to me?
I don't know what that is.
It's the girls' progress reports.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I put that on your desk a while ago.
You must have been out of town.
Please.
It's obvious why you wanted to keep these from me.
They're not exactly setting the academic world on fire, are they?
Um, I wasn't trying to keep anything from you.
I--I thought you'd be pleased to see how much their grades have gone up since last year.
I couldn't care less about last year.
It's this year that counts.
And from what I can tell, you're not working nearly hard enough.
I'm so sorry.
I'm just gonna take this outside.
I don't recall giving you permission to have a houseguest.
I cleared it with Geraldine.
Geraldine doesn't have the authority to decide who sleeps under this roof.
If you're gonna use my home as your own personal Ritz Carlton, you should ask me directly.
I'm sorry.
I--
I tried to get a hold of you, but you've been a little hard to pin down lately.
You've made your bed, Megan.
I suggest you figure out how to lie in it.
I know.
Was--is that your boss, too?
It was.
Oh, my god.
Did we just get chewed out simultaneously, because that would be almost poetic.
Not exactly.
Um...
Oh, no.
Did--
Did you just get fired?
Actually, no.
Um... ha ha, I just got promoted.
Oh!
Really?
Ah, well, that is great!
Wow!
Congratulations.
You are in luck, because Marco just happened to bake some of his famous
"congratulations on becoming an assistant editor" cupcakes.
How fortunate that I happen to be an assistant editor in need of congratulations.
Yeah, it worked out kinda nicely, huh?
If he made his Mazal tov on your Bar Mitzvah" brownies.
You are so sweet to do this.
And I was thinking.
Yes?
Ok, this might be slightly awkward, but... now that the assistant position at the Finley review is available,
I was thinking maybe you'd want to take it.
Your old job?
It would be so much fun.
You could move back to New York.
We could get an apartment together.
I mean, this is exactly the kind of job you wanted right out of college.
Well, it was the job that I wanted out of college.
I applied for it, but you got it, remember?
that's how I wound up at page 11.
Oh, I didn't--I didn't want this to be awkward.
No, it's not.
It's not.
It's just--
You know, I sort of have already done the assistant thing.
And, you know, come on.
You were just telling me how awful that job was.
I was being a whiner.
This job is so much closer to doing what you actually want to be doing.
I hate to see you wasting your time as a nanny--
I'm a tutor, not a nanny.
Megan...
Come on.
We're gonna be late for Will's tennis tournament.
You're mad, aren't you?
No, I'm not mad.
I...
It's hard.
I mean, come on.
Yesterday when you got here, we were on the same page.
And now you're on a completely different stratosphere, and I'm sort of... all the misery without the company.
I know, I'm-- I'm sorry.
Don't be!
I'm psyched for you.
And I appreciate you wanting to help, but I'm happy here.
Come on!
I am.
I just need to get another project going, that's all.
And you and I both know that I wouldn't get any writing done if I took some crazy assistant job in New York.
That's probably true.
If I'm gonna get a book off the ground, this is the best place for me to be.
Now!
You ready to see a sporting event?
Ok, tell me again why we're doing this?
Oh, you'll see, trust me.
All right.
That book was so lame.
I can't believe they make us read this crap.
You're finished, already?
Why would an American guy join the Italian army?
It makes no sense.
My ass could write better than Ernest Hemingway.
Wait, how could you be done already?
I'm barely halfway.
Well, maybe if you didn't waste all your time looking up every other word, you'd be done, too.
Hey, Megan says that increasing my vocabulary is the easiest way to boost my... comprehension.
Megan is old.
Hello?
- Hey, honey.
- Patricia, hey!
Patricia:
Sage, honey...
Where's your sister?
We gotta talk.
Are you both there?
I'm gonna knock your socks off.
Hey, Patricia, we're both on.
Patricia:
My darlings, I have some amazing news.
Sit down.
All right, listen up.
The Lauren-Kate consortium is a group of investors.
They're artists, they're musicians, movie stars;
creative people with much too much money who party like it's 1999.
Ok, she's old.
Shh!
Anyway, they own dozens of nightclubs from L.A. to Dubai, and tomorrow night, they are opening one in Miami called Chanm?
All right?
Big opening, and you two are going to be there.
You are gonna walk the red carpet, you are gonna smile for the cameras...
That sounds great!
Yeah, well, it gets even greater, all right?
They are looking for a hot girl opening act, and because I work miracles, thank you, you two are the hot girls.
Hello?
Both: we're here!
All right, listen, pick one song.
Just some cool cover, ok?
Tomorrow afternoon is the rehearsal and the sound check.
Tonight I need you to meet with Adelmo, my favorite stylist.
Are you with me?
I hope you girls are ready to be famous, 'cause you're gonna be.
Oh, my god!
We're gonna be famous!
Caryn: ok, now I get it.
Yay, sports.
I told you.
Although you might want to at least pretend to watch the game.
Or the match, or whatever it is they call it.
Who can pay attention with all this man candy in front of us?
Now I understand why you're so happy here.
Caryn!
What?
!
Will is basically the hottest guy ever.
Why haven't you thrown yourself at his feet?
'Cause I have a little self respect.
I want to put him a cracker.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but the man you're ogling happens to be someone I know, so...
Oh, we are not ogling.
She is ogling.
Just in case you were going to report back this incident.
How close are you guys?
And by that I mean, do you know what type he usually goes for?
Well, you have to ask him.
I'm just his boss.
You're Peter Friedland?
!
Yes, I am.
Hi!
Yeah.
And you are?
I'm Megan Smith.
This is my friend Caryn Green.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Oh, Will has told me all about you.
He's so excited he'll be working for you.
Oh, he's a good kid.
Takes Pretty decent shots, too.
So how do you know Will?
Oh, um, he's my neighbor.
Well, he's not my neighbor, but he lives in the house next to the house that I live in Palm Beach.
Palm Beach?
Yeah, yeah.
I work-slash-live at Les Anges and he lives with his parents over at Via Tranquilla.
I love how all the fancy Palm Beach mansions have names.
It's hilarious.
I know.
I guess I never realized that will lived with his parents.
Oh, no, no, I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
He doesn't live there because he has to.
He's not a slacker or anything.
I mean, if my family owned half of the oil in this country,
I would probably live with them until I got married.
Wait a second, are you telling me that Will Davis is...
Will Davis as in Davis oil?
Um, yeah.
Sorta seems like he didn't know that.
Yeah.
I'm starting to get that idea.
It's a shame.
Hey, Will, gotta talk.
Oh, hey, Megan.
You're not really supposed to be up here.
And my boss is there, so--
Oh, I know, I know.
We're sitting next to him.
He's so nice.
Oh.
Right.
Well, have fun.
Ok, will do.
But here's the thing.
Can we talk later?
I really have to...
For sure.
In a jiff.
Um, I just wanted to give you a head's up.
I told Peter Friedland that you were really, really rich.
Not sure if that's important to you, but just wanted to let you know, ok?
Wait, you did what?
!
Ok, guess it is important.
Glad I checked in with you.
That--that was an amazing shot.
Well, I'm sorry you missed that.
Come on.
All right, explain this to me.
How did you manage to work my family's money into the conversation?
Well, uh, I didn't do it on purpose.
It just sort of came out.
I didn't know it was a secret.
It's not a secret.
It's just not something that my boss needed to know.
I'm so sorry.
I--
But if it makes you feel any better,
I don't think he thinks it's that big of a deal.
Yeah, it is.
I didn't tell Peter who my family was because I wanted us to have a normal relationship.
I mean, he probably wouldn't have hired me if he knew who I was.
That's crazy.
Not so much.
I bet a lot of people would think that it's odd that I'm working for $10 an hour bringing some guy coffee and wiping off dirty camera lenses all day.
Ok, well, he may think it's odd, but he can't fire you for being rich.
Never mind.
You don't-- you don't get it.
No, I do, I do get it.
You want him to like you for who you are, but he does.
He just told me that he thought you were a good kid.
It's not about him liking me for me.
All right?
I'm not marrying the guy.
It's just that our whole dynamic is going to be off now.
I think you're overreacting...
No, it's not about what you think.
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.
Never mind.
All right, it's fine.
I gotta get back out there.
All this for a study session?
We crammed for our chaucer final on nothing but cold pizza and pop rocks.
And if I remember correctly, we both aced it.
Well, these girls have a little bit harder time focusing.
So if a little cucumber water gets them to read a few chapters, than so be it.
Did I tell you, my first assignment is to help my boss edit a piece by Michael Chabon.
Holy crap, you're kidding me.
That's amazing.
Hey, girls.
Ooh, a little fancy schmancy for a night of studying, huh?
We're going out.
Uh, no, you're not.
We have a study session, remember?
Oh, well, I mean, we just figured it was canceled since you have a friend in town.
Hi, Marcy.
Um, it's Caryn, and nice try.
But get your butts in the seats.
Mm-mmm, not happening.
We have a meeting with our new stylist.
What stylist-- what are you talking about?
Laurel already signed off on the whole thing, and since it has nothing to do with school, it's none of your business.
Well, Laurel also came to me very upset about your recent progress reports.
So there's a little discrepancy.
Look, girls, I don't know what's going on here, but this final counts for 30% of your grade.
We still have to deal with subtext and symbolism archetypes, historical contexts.
I wish I could put you in a historical context right now.
Ok, wait, look, Megan, we're really sorry about tonight, but we cannot get out of this.
It's like a huge deal.
What is it?
Whatever.
Tell her.
Ok.
We signed with a really huge publicist who's helping us get started on, like, career stuff.
What?
Look, I promise you it won't get in the way of school stuff, ok?
It already is getting in the way.
No, but we can do both!
I mean, you find time to do your job and all your personal stuff, right?
Yeah, but I'm a multitasker at heart.
So that's what we'll be.
Unless you don't think we can do it.
Which would mean you don't believe in us, which would really suck.
Rose, I believe in you girls, but you can't keep skipping study sessions, ok?
Hmm.
That took forever.
Thank you for being so cool about this.
I won't let you down, ok?
Bye.
Are you not dying to know what their career thing is?
I'm guessing nuclear physics.
I'm kidding!
No, I know.
Ugh.
They're not usually like that.
Well, they were, but I thought we were making so much progress.
Meggie, those girls are never going to care about school the way you and I did.
Don't kill yourself over it.
Well, I guess the good news is- is that now I have a night off.
We can get all dolled up and hit the clubs.
What?
!
Don't look at me like that!
We are gonna have a real Miami night out on the town.
Oh, my god, do you remember that guy in postmodern drama with the fake British accent?
Oh, he was so annoying!
And he got away with calling professor Bernstein Bob.
I mean, who does that?
I know!
It is so great having you here.
I miss having a girlfriend around.
I miss you, too.
And I've been thinking.
Just hear me out, ok?
You are an amazingly talented writer.
It's silly for you not to be working on something just because of this tutoring job.
I told you, I was going to find a new project.
I just haven't figured out what that is yet.
Well, if you ask me, it's staring you right in the face.
Uh, pork fried rice?
The effects of MSG, extreme bloating?
Your life.
Think about it.
What you are experiencing right now is outrageous.
I bet the Finley Review would be very interested in something like this.
I doubt the Finley Review would be interested in publishing a story about me.
Well, not just you.
It would be an exposé on your life here.
A broke Yale graduate--
Whose apartment burned down.
Whose apartment burned down, gets a job working as a tutor at a fancy Palm Beach mansion, neighbor to a handsome billionaire Who works for minimum wage...
Who works for minimum wage
And probably isn't speaking to me anymore.
See, it totally writes itself.
It's like Nanny Diaries meets Devil Wears Prada with an edgy, TMZ spin.
I couldn't do that.
Why not?
It's your story, so you don't have to get anyone's permission.
And you're the one who said that you wanted to stay in Palm Beach so you can write.
So... why not write this?
That's true, but...
It's not so crazy when you think about it.
You've always been so convinced that you wanted to write someone else's biography.
Maybe you're supposed to be writing your own.
These are good, Will.
Some of these are very good.
Oh, you really think so?
I wasn't sure about the composition with this batch.
No, I like them, they're good.
Oh, no, no, sit down.
It's ok, it's ok, really.
I'm sure the waiter will reappear one of these days.
What?
I've been refilling your coffee for over a year now, Peter.
You never had a problem with it before.
I didn't know you would wipe your ass with my paychecks before.
I'm sorry, was that too blunt?
Nope.
I get it.
But I hope you can understand why I chose to not tell you about my situation.
Money makes most people uncomfortable, and you assumed I was one of those people, which means you must not think very highly of me.
No, that's not the case at all.
Well, then what is it, Will?
I'm curious.
What goes through the mind of a twenty-something billionaire?
I just didn't want you to question my dedication to this job.
I'm very grateful for the opportunity to work with you and learn from you.
I'm very passionate about photography.
Oh, I know you are.
I take this very seriously.
I just needed you to treat me like you treat anybody else.
Fair enough.
Go on, get me a refill, kid.
No, I'm just kidding.
Sit down.
What are you doing?
Sit.
I'm just messing with you.
Sit.
Really.
Hey, just out of curiosity... how much are you worth, actually?
* Never know how much I love you *
* Never know how much I care *
* When you put your arms around me *
* I get a fever that's so hard to bare *
* You give me fever *
*When you kiss me *
* Fever when you hold me tight *
* A fever *
* In the morning *
* Fever all through the night *
* Everybody's got the fever *
* That is something you all know *
* Fever isn't *
* Such a new thing *
* Fever started long ago *
Rose Baker, people!
Was that ok?
Are you kidding me?
You are a star, my little lovely.
You are a freaking star!
Holly, call Lenka's people, tell them we will not need her this weekend after all.
Thank them, ok?
You had backup for us?
No, no, no, don't be silly, honey.
It was a whole different thing.
So you really think we were good?
I think you were spectacular!
I mean, when I got that CD,
I thought maybe you'd broken out the digital voice enhancer, but you are the real deal.
What about-- what about me?
Was I ok?
Yes, honey, you looked very pretty.
You just keep doing what you're doing, ok?
All right, listen to me.
Have you ever thought about getting into acting?
I mean, with those pipes, what, you could--you could be in the sequel to "Hairspray"!
Lucy:
I don't think I'd be that good at acting.
Yeah, you know what, Zac Efron said the same thing to me, and look at him now.
Sit down for a bit.
Ok.
All right, here's the deal.
Here's what I want you to do.
I want you...
Rose?
Sage?
Caught under a shoe avalanche?
Hello?
What's with the furrowed brow?
Someone suck all the cream out of your éclair?
Ew.
Sorry.
Sometimes the cooking metaphors go astray.
So where's your brainy gal pal?
She's on the phone with Michael Chabon.
That's right.
She's schmoozing with Pulitzer prize winning novelists, and I'm pretty much a glorified baby-sitter.
Not that glorified.
I mean, I could be writing, too, you know.
All right?
I got ideas.
And instead of collaborating with brilliant writers,
I'm getting ditched by the girls again.
So why don't you talk to Laurel?
I would love to talk to Laurel, but she won't take any of my calls.
And she gets all mad about the girls' grades not being good enough, but then she lets them hire a freaking publicist!
I mean, it's like she wants me to fail.
So don't let her.
Why not?
I mean, seriously, Marco.
Why am I the only one busting my ass if nobody cares?
I mean, if nobody wants me around, then why the hell am I here?
Ok, if I knew you were throwing a pity party,
I would have whipped up some hours d'oeuvres.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
I don't know, I thought having Caryn here would make me feel better about my life, but it's only made me feel worse.
And I know the race is long, and it's only with myself, blah, blah, blah, but...
I don't know, sometimes it's nice just to have a running buddy, you know?
Well, if you're looking for someone to commiserate with, why don't you call Will?
Boy's got real problems.
What kind of problems does Will have?
Did he forget to charge his golf cart?
No.
He lost his job.
They were saying that the deadline might have changed for that?
Um, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, they told me about that.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I am, um,
I just want you to know, you know, whatever you need from me.
I mean, I can do copies, I can do it from here, actually.
I'm flying in tomorrow, so I'll be available--
Will:
Hey, this is Will.
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.
Hi.
It's me.
Megan...
Smith.
Red hair.
I was, uh, just calling to apologize again.
And to see how you were doing, and you probably hate me right now, which I totally understand.
It's perfectly warranted.
But anyway, if you just want to give me a call back, that would be great, ok?
Ok.
Uh, bye.
Yeah.
Yes.
Ok, great, yeah, yeah.
Tomorrow at 7:00, I will definitely be there.
Girls!
There you are.
Oh, you look spectac!
Oh, you're sparkly.
Ready to work those magic pipes, huh?
Well, I guess.
All right, good.
I want to introduce you to Perez, all right?
Not only can he make anybody famous, but his website is the perfect place to drop your single.
Single?
Mm-hmm.
Stick with me, you'll have an entire album.
You mean me and Sage, right?
What?
Well, the album.
It'd be for us to do together?
Yeah, absolutely.
Come on.
Perez!
Whoo!
Honey!
Hi!
Look at you, you are wasting away!
I'll take that as a compliment.
Is there any other way to take it?
This is Rose Baker.
All right?
She is the next Amy Winehouse--
Minus the crack habit.
And this is Sage, her sister.
Rose is working on some music.
I'm telling you, it's gonna blow you away.
Tell him about your music, honey.
Is she a mute?
Ha ha, you'll have to forgive my sister.
She gets very shy when she talks about her music.
Besides, she's saving her voice for the performance.
I understand.
Her majesty does the same thing.
Love Madonna, she's our hero.
In fact, I think our first single will be reminiscent of ray of light, but with a totally retro, beastie boys, Run DMC hip-hop vibe.
Shut up!
I love it!
I can't wait to hear it.
We can't wait to play it for you.
Darling, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Well, come on, let's take a picture.
There you go.
I am so sad you're leaving early.
The fun was just getting started.
I know.
I wish I could stay!
But my boss really thinks I should meet Michael in person
I can't believe you're in a first-name basis with Michael Chabon did hot neighbor call you back yet?
No.
He's probably still mad at me.
Not that I can blame him.
Oh, stop it!
It is not your fault he got fired, ok?
And if he is mad at you, he's just another
Palm Beach idiot.
End of story.
So listen, I, um,
I spoke to my boss about your article.
He's very interested.
What article?
Well, I presented it as an article, but you know, you could always write it as a first chapter, and then maybe we could do a book like Gopnik did with Paris to the moon--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, Caryn.
Back up.
I never said I was going to be writing that piece.
How could you not?
It's--it's such a great idea.
It's not like I can write that while I'm still working here, and I'm certainly not in any position to be quitting right now.
No, why would you quit?
No, it's way better if you stay here longer, anyway.
You get more dirt that way.
I don't care about the dirt.
That's not the kind of writing that I want to do.
And... more importantly, that's not the kind of person that I want to be.
You wouldn't be writing anything that isn't true.
I mean, Laurel is an ice queen, and those girls are vapid princesses who can't read a book without cucumber water.
Hey!
I'm overstating for dramatic purposes, but you know what I mean.
They're not like that at all, and the fact that you're judging them so harshly without even knowing them--
Oh, you are being way too sensitive here, ok?
It's called journalism.
No, it's not journalism.
It's tacky and cheap and I'm not going to do it.
You're really putting me in a bad situation, Megan, ok?
I already told my boss we were gonna do this, and he got all excited.
Well, you shouldn't have done that!
Why do you care about these people so much?
They obviously don't give a crap about you.
We're going through a rough patch.
It's not always like this.
I-I don't even know you right now.
The Megan I knew would have killed for an opportunity like this.
This is the kind of situation you and I used to dream about--
No!
It's not.
And if you ever thought that I was the kind of person that would intentionally hurt someone just to get ahead at a stupid magazine, then... you really didn't know me at all.
I'll talk to you later.
I wonder how long it'll take before our pictures are posted online.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, you were so good with Perez.
I still cannot get over it.
Wasn't he so nice?
Yeah.
This was by far the best night ever.
Oh, without a doubt.
I can't believe Orlando Bloom gave you his phone number.
Are you going to call him?
Hello?
What?
Oh, never mind.
We'll do a recap later.
I'm exhausted.
Yeah, me, too.
I didn't know we'd be out that late.
Get some rest.
You got a lot of bragging to do at school tomorrow.
Yeah, and our first final.
Oh, right.
Blecch!
Megan: where's the butler when you need him?
You were actually going to leave without saying good-bye?
I didn't think you'd want to talk to me.
Come on.
Don't you remember some of the blowout fights we had in college?
Last night wouldn't have even registered on the Richter scale.
I do remember a broken lamp once.
I'm sorry if I put you in an awkward position with your boss.
It's not your fault.
I shouldn't have been so presumptuous.
I truly never thought the article would be an issue.
Unintentional magazine pun.
Look, you obviously care a great deal about these people.
Not sure I understand why, but...
It's not my place to judge.
I know how it seems, but the truth is,
I'm responsible for a lot of what's going on around here lately.
Laurel does have the right to be mad at me, and I did overstep my boundaries.
And the girls are smart!
Meggie!
No, no, no, I'm serious.
I mean, they may not care about school right now, but I want them to have choices later on in their lives, and I feel like it's my job to make sure that happens.
I know it sounds stupid.
No, it does not sound stupid.
It sounds like you.
Look, this family may not know how lucky they are to have you, but I do.
Oh, there's my cab.
All right.
Ok.
And I promise to keep writing while I'm down here.
I won't spend all my down time getting a tan.
Good.
Call me when you land.
I will.
Bye.
That was a quick trip.
Laurel...
Um, I'm glad you're here.
Do you have a minute?
I just want you to know that I took a look at the girls' grades, and you were right.
They do need to step it up, and I need to step it up.
So to that end I added another study session to their schedule.
They've been a little distracted lately, and I just need to get their focus back.
Fine.
So, did you have a nice time with your friend?
Yeah.
It was nice to see her.
Crossed my mind that you might have been inclined to book a ticket home with her.
If you don't want me here anymore, Laurel,
I can leave.
We don't need to make a big deal about it, nobody needs to know why.
But for whatever it's worth,
I want to stay.
Working for you has... it's been everything that I'd hoped it would be.
Ok.
Well, at least I can see the potential.
I know that things haven't been easy for you these past few weeks.
I haven't been easy on you.
In my position, it's difficult to place one's trust in anyone.
I understand.
More than ever, I understand.
And I plan to prove my loyalty to you for as long as it takes.
I appreciate that.
You know, I was impressed with you the first time I met you.
It's quite a relief to think my instincts might not have been wrong after all.
Len just flew these in from Fauchon, Paris.
Shall we indulge?
You have 55 minutes to complete your essays.
Remember the three C's--
Clear, cogent, concise.
Good luck.
You busy?
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
I was just--
Rewriting your apology letter to me?
Make sure you spell-check it.
Don't laugh.
I've drafted a few pretty pathetic emails just in case you never call me back.
I would never not call you back.
I still want to apologize.
You don't have to.
No, yes, I do.
I feel terrible.
I should never have said anything.
It's ok.
I still cannot believe that your boss would fire you over this.
Not only is it unfair, it's so totally illegal!
In fact, you know what?
Give me his phone number.
Ok?
Because I can be really scary on the phone.
Oh, I'm sure you can.
And it's nice of you to offer to go to bat for me like that, but honestly, it's all good.
I wasn't fired.
I quit.
You quit?
Yeah.
Well, the more I thought about it, it was time to move on.
I've been playing it safe for a while now.
You have?
I have.
Maybe all this happened for a reason.
You know, force me to step it up a notch and see what else is out there.
So, in a way,
I helped.
In a way.
Well, good, good, that is good.
Because I'm about to help some more, because I'm very good at the next part.
And what's the next part?
Résumés, job hunting, interviews.
I so totally rock at the interview.
You wouldn't think so, because of my whole nervous talking thing, but it can be pretty helpful in hiring situations.
Is that right?
Definitely.
We'll put together a really professional portfolio.
I have a label maker.
Of course you do.
Organization is the key.
The first thing that we will do
Is send out about 20 emails and see what... comes back.
I... you know, I found it best to stagger everything--
Wait.
What?
I think I left my label maker in my old apartment.
I'll get a new one.
Revised and edited by ju.vianna
previously on privileged...
is this sage baker?
speaking.
nigel barker told me i need to be in the sage and rose business.
we are having lunch with patricia kingston tomorrow!
who's patricia kingston?
huge publicist!
part of the reason that i wanted to work here was so that i could meet people that were worth writing about.
who's more accomplished than laurel?
you're writing an unauthorized biography of laurel?
i did something bad.
what did you do?
i decided to do more research on laurel.
?
i?
well, maybe you shouldn't tell her.
if i could turn back time and unlearn what i learned, i would.
what do you want from me?
i don't want anything from you.
well, let's see how honorable you really are.
today is finally here!
you nearly cost me my eyebrows.
i'm sorry, i've just been waiting for today for so long, and now it's finally here.
and quite frankly, it could not have come at a better time.
my best friend from yale is flying in from new york today.
her name is caryn, and you're going to love her.
well, i'm only starting to love you.
let's not muddy the waters.
we were roommates all four years.
we were both scholarship students in the honors journalism program.
anyway, now she works as an assistant at the finley review.
ooh, fancy.
mm-hmm.
and we've both been so busy, we haven't seen each other in forever.
it'll be nice to finally have someone to commiserate with.
marco, i need to see the final menu for the shareholder's dinner.
marco:
right away.
morning, laurel.
you can bring it into my office.
and the hate continues.
no, it's just a phase.
she goes through that with everyone. it'll pass.
ah, i'm not so sure this one will.
mmm, not that she doesn't have a reason to be angry at me, but... you ever gonna tell me why?
nope.
ooh, good, you're here!
see, that's the kind of greeting i like.
danke.
so my friend caryn is flying in from new york and she's gonna stay with me for a couple of days, and i was hoping you could show us some of that rich-ass palm beach livin'.
you know, maybe we could take a spin on of your yachts tomorrow afternoon.
how many yachts do you think i have?
ok, well, if the yacht's unavailable, we'll go for a ride on your horses or elephants.
you're the billionaire, you tell me what's going on.
as much as i'd love to take you ladies out for a spin on the davis family elephants, sorry to say that i'm working this week.
you're what?
i'm working.
didn't it ever occur to you that i might have a job?
uh, no.
but that's probably 'cause i've known you for 4 months, and you never mentioned you had one, but i'm silly like that.
i work for peter friedland.
he's a sports photographer.
hey, like you.
like me... except he gets paid and published and all that good stuff.
he does mostly freelance, so whenever he's doing something in town, he hires me to get his coffee, do his bidding and absorb his genius.
you do coffee runs?
you are blowin' my mind here, william.
yeah, well... tomorrow he's giving me a really cool break, actually.
there's this charity tennis tournament over in west palm, and he's gonna let me cover it and critique my work.
really?
that's amazing.
i can probably score you and your friend some seats if you want.
the brian brothers are playing.
well, that would be great.
i mean, if the safari's unavailable.
you know i don't really own any elephants, right?
i don't know!
hey, girls.
big week next week.
finals are just around the corner.
we gotta get serious.
first up is english lit.
aww, yeah!
do you know that since you moved into this house, i actually look forward to going to school every morning.
aw, thanks, sage.
not a compliment.
ok, well, you don't have to worry about me finishing it, because i am so loving a farewell to arms.
and i'm only a few chapters in, but i'm already picturing james franco as frederick.
how hot would that be?
oh, so hot.
and i'm glad you like it.
that's really great, rose.
yeah, well, some of the vocab's a little tough, but i'm using that online dictionary you showed me.
ily making a big difference.
oh, good, 'cause when we get around to s.a.t. stuff, that's really going to help-- oh!
ooh, ooh, ooh!
ooh, ooh, ooh!
you're here!
i'm here!
yay!
hi!
come on.
give me your stuff, give me your stuff.f, oh, my god!
i cannot believe you actually live here now!
i am in awe.
and i am in awe of your outfit.
thanks!
not a compliment.
why do people just assume?
uh, caryn, this is rose and sage baker. girls, this is caryn, my best friend from yale.
oh, nice to meet you.
you, too.
yeah. let's go, rose.
we're going to be late.
bye.
do you realize that one pair of their shoes would, like, pay my rent for a month?
i don't mean to make you sad, but a half a pair of those shoes would cover it.
[chuckles] oh, sorry. hang on.
ugh, it's work.
you wanna answer it?
no, i'm gonna call back later.
my boss is being such a nightmare.
i don't think he understands the concept of vacation.
yeah, my boss hasn't exactly been a joy to be around lately, either.
i thought you loved your boss.
i did. i mean, i do.
uh...it just got weird.
oh. it sounds like a good, old-fashioned bitch session is in order.
yes, yes.
a million times yes.
oh, actually, that's my stuff.
oh, no, no, don't worry.
that's rami.
he's the butler.
oh. hi, rami the butler.
do not hug me.
ok.
a butler with space issues.
come on, let me show you around.
ok.
ok, then, what about the perfume idea?
we love perfume.
mmm, we can't do anything with make-up.
it's too close to laurel.
we don't want this to seem like a nepotism situation.
plus, i promised my tutor no publicizing until after 3 p.m.
hmm, girls.
here's the sit-i-ation.
you've definitely got the "it" factor, and you may be a big deal here on rich people island, but you cross that bridge, nobody's ever heard of you.
well, that sucks.
well, i mean, not necessarily.
i mean, it just means we can make you into anything.
we just have to start somewhere.
anywhere.
anything.
do you blog?
ugh.
you know, the little one's getting on my nerves.
we don't mean to be picky.
it's just, we've all seen how these things can go.
i mean, a regional print ad, some bad reality tv, and then perez catches you with a drink in your hand and your 15 minutes are up.
are you kidding?
what 15 minutes?
most crazies get a full primetime hour these days.
but we want more than that.
we want longevity;
a career.
i mean, look at madonna.
that woman is literally a hundred years old, and she's still relevant.
that's what we want.
yes, but queen esther, she arrived on the scene with a clear, definable skill, all right?
you have to give me something to work with.
rose can sing.
mmm!
yeah, i can.
and sage is practically an expert at the guitar.
yeah. eric clapton has a house next to ours in turks and caicos.
he taught me all kinds of stuff.
well, how come you didn't mention this before?
we didn't think it mattered.
well, it certainly makes my job easier.
do you have something i can listen to?
um, yeah, laurel, she bought us a day at the recording studio for our sweet 16.
i can bring you a copy of the single we cut.
good.
and i can get you eric's number if you need it.
mmm, yeah, no thanks.
i have it.
all right, good.
give me some time to work this new angle out, and i will get back to you, all right?
ciao, bellas.
our first professional meeting.
i feel so business-y.
i know.
maybe we should hire an assistant.
i can't believe you pulled the plug on the whole laurel book.
i thought it was such a great idea.
i know, i know, and i was having so much fun with it, but then things got off-track with laurel.
which i still don't understand.
i mean, the book was basically a love letter to her.
it's complicated.
and now i just feel totally stalled.
oh, i know.
i spend most of my time making copies, and when i'm not doing that, i'm going on coffee runs for my boss and making sure the deli doesn't put too much mustard on his pastrami sandwich.
i'm so glad i got my ivy league degree.
oh, laurel.
um, this is my friend caryn.
would you like to explain this to me?
i don't know what that is.
it's the girls' progress reports.
oh, yeah, yeah. i put that on your desk a while ago.
you must have been out of town.
please.
it's obvious why you wanted to keep these from me.
they're not exactly setting the academic world on fire, are they?
um, i wasn't trying to keep anything from you.
i--i thought you'd be pleased to see how much their grades have gone up since last year.
i couldn't care less about last year.
it's this year that counts.
and from what i can tell, you're not working nearly hard enough.
i'm so sorry.
i'm just gonna take this outside.
i don't recall giving you permission to have a houseguest.
i cleared it with geraldine.
geraldine doesn't have the authority to decide who sleeps under this roof.
if you're gonna use my home as your own personal ritz carlton, you should ask me directly.
i'm sorry. i-- i tried to get a hold of you, but you've been a little hard to pin down lately.
you've made your bed, megan.
i suggest you figure out how to lie in it.
i know.
was--is that your boss, too?
it was.
oh, my god.
did we just get chewed out simultaneously, because that would be almost poetic.
not exactly. um... oh, no. did-- did you just get fired?
actually, no.
um...ha ha, i just got promoted.
oh!
really?
ah, well, that is great!
wow!
congratulations.
you are in luck, because marco just happened to bake some of his famous
"congratulations on becoming an assistant editor" cupcakes.
how fortunate that i happen to be an assistant editor in need of congratulations.
yeah, it worked out kinda nicely, huh?
if he made his "mazal tov on your bar mitzvah" brownies.
you are so sweet to do this.
and i was thinking.
yes?
ok, this might be slightly awkward, but... now that the assistant position at the finley review is available, i was thinking maybe you'd want to take it.
your old job?
it would be so much fun.
you could move back to new york.
we could get an apartment together.
i mean, this is exactly the kind of job you wanted right out of college.
well, it was the job that i wanted out of college.
i applied for it, but you got it, remember?
that's how i wound up at page 11.
oh, i didn't--i didn't want this to be awkward.
no, it's not.
it's not. it's just-- you know, i sort of have already done the assistant thing.
and, you know, come on.
you were just telling me how awful that job was.
i was being a whiner.
this job is so much closer to doing what you actually want to be doing.
i hate to see you wasting your time as a nanny-- i'm a tutor, not a nanny.
megan...
come on.
we're gonna be late for will's tennis tournament.
you're mad, aren't you?
no, i'm not mad. i... it's hard.
i mean, come on.
yesterday when you got here, we were on the same page.
and now you're on a completely different stratosphere, and i'm sort of...
all the misery without the company.
i know, i'm-- i'm sorry.
don't be!
i'm psyched for you.
and i appreciate you wanting to help, but i'm happy here.
come on!
i am.
i just need to get another project going, that's all.
and you and i both know that i wouldn't get any writing done if i took some crazy assistant job in new york.
that's probably true.
if i'm gonna get a book off the ground, this is the best place for me to be.
now!
you ready to see a sporting event?
ok, tell me again why we're doing this?
oh, you'll see, trust me.
all right.
that book was so lame.
i can't believe they make us read this crap.
you're finished, already?
why would an american guy join the italian army?
it makes no sense.
my ass could write better than ernest hemingway.
wait, how could you be done already?
i'm barely halfway.
well, maybe if you didn't waste all your time looking up every other word, you'd be done, too.
hey, megan says that increasing my vocabulary
megan is old.
hello?
?
patricia, hey!
patricia: sage, honey...
where's your sister?
we gotta talk.
are you both there?
i'm gonna knock your socks off.
hey, patricia, we're both on.
patricia: my darlings, i have some amazing news.
sit down.
all right, listen up.
the lauren-kate consortium is a group of investors.
they're artists, they're musicians, movie stars;
creative people with much too much money who party like it's 1999.
ok, she's old.
shh!
anyway, they own dozens of nightclubs from l.a. to dubai, and tomorrow night, they are opening one in miami called chanm?
all right?
big opening, and you two are going to be there.
you are gonna walk the red carpet, you are gonna smile for the cameras... that sounds great!
yeah, well, it gets even greater, all right?
they are looking for a hot girl opening act, and because i work miracles, thank you, you two are the hot girls.
hello?
both: we're here!
all right, listen, pick one song.
just some cool cover, ok?
tomorrow afternoon is the rehearsal and the sound check.
tonight i need you to meet with adelmo, my favorite stylist.
are you with me?
i hope you girls are ready to be famous, 'cause you're gonna be.
oh, my god!
we're gonna be famous!
caryn: ok, now i get it.
yay, sports.
i told you.
although you might want to at least pretend to watch the game.
or the match, or whatever it is they call it.
who can pay attention with all this man candy in front of us?
now i understand why you're so happy here.
caryn!
what?
!
will is basically the hottest guy ever.
why haven't you thrown yourself at his feet?
'cause i have a little self respect.
i want to put him a cracker.
i'm sorry to interrupt, but the man you're ogling happens to be someone i know, so... oh, we are not ogling.
she is ogling.
just in case you were going to report back this incident.
how close are you guys?
and by that i mean, do you know what type he usually goes for?
well, you have to ask him.
i'm just his boss.
you're peter friedland?
!
yes, i am.
hi!
yeah. and you are?
i'm megan smith.
this is my friend caryn green.
hi, nice to meet you.
oh, will has told me all about you.
he's so excited he'll be working for you.
oh, he's a good kid.
takes pretty decent shots, too.
so how do you know will?
oh, um, he's my neighbor.
well, he's not my neighbor, but he lives in the house next to the house that i live in palm beach.
palm beach?
yeah, yeah.
i work-slash-live at les anges and he lives with his parents over at via tranquilla.
i love how all the fancy palm beach mansions have names.
it's hilarious.
i know.
i guess i never realized that will lived with his parents.
oh, no, no, i don't want you to get the wrong idea.
he doesn't live there because he has to.
he's not a slacker or anything.
i mean, if my family owned half of the oil in this country, i would probably live with them until i got married.
wait a second, are you telling me that will davis is... will davis as in davis oil?
um, yeah.
sorta seems like he didn't know that.
yeah. i'm starting to get that idea.
it's a shame.
hey, will, gotta talk.
oh, hey, megan.
you're not really supposed to be up here.
and my boss is there, so-- oh, i know, i know.
we're sitting next to him.
he's so nice.
oh. right.
well, have fun.
ok, will do.
but here's the thing.
can we talk later?
i really have to... for sure. in a jiff.
um, i just wanted to give you a head's up.
i told peter friedland that you were really, really rich.
not sure if that's important to you, but just wanted to let you know, ok?
wait, you did what?
!
ok, guess it is important.
glad i checked in with you.
that--that was an amazing shot.
well, i'm sorry you missed that.
come on.
all right, explain this to me.
how did you manage to work my family's money into the conversation?
well, uh, i didn't do it on purpose.
it just sort of came out. i didn't know it was a secret.
it's not a secret.
it's just not something that my boss needed to know.
i'm so sorry. i-- but if it makes you feel any better, i don't think he thinks it's that big of a deal.
yeah, it is.
i didn't tell peter who my family was because i wanted us to have a normal relationship.
i mean, he probably wouldn't have hired me if he knew who i was.
that's crazy.
not so much.
i bet a lot of people would think that it's odd that i'm working for $10 an hour bringing some guy coffee and wiping off dirty camera lenses all day.
ok, well, he may think it's odd, but he can't fire you for being rich.
never mind. you don't-- you don't get it.
no, i do, i do get it.
you want him to like you for who you are, but he does.
he just told me that he thought you were a good kid.
it's not about him liking me for me.
all right?
i'm not marrying the guy.
it's just that our whole dynamic is going to be off now.
i think you're overreacting... no, it's not about what you think.
i'm sorry.
it was an accident.
never mind.
all right, it's fine.
i gotta get back out there.
all this for a study session?
we crammed for our chaucer final on nothing but cold pizza and pop rocks.
and if i remember correctly, we both aced it.
well, these girls have a little bit harder time focusing.
so if a little cucumber water gets them to read a few chapters, than so be it.
did i tell you, my first assignment is to help my boss edit a piece by michael chabon.
holy crap, you're kidding me.
that's amazing.
hey, girls.
ooh, a little fancy schmancy for a night of studying, huh?
we're going out.
uh, no, you're not.
we have a study session, remember?
oh, well, i mean, we just figured it was canceled since you have a friend in town.
hi, marcy.
um, it's caryn, and nice try.
but get your butts in the seats.
mm-mmm, not happening.
we have a meeting with our new stylist.
what stylist-- what are you talking about?
laurel already signed off on the whole thing, and since it has nothing to do with school, it's none of your business.
well, laurel also came to me very upset about your recent progress reports.
so there's a little discrepancy.
look, girls, i don't know what's going on here, but this final counts for 30% of your grade.
we still have to deal with subtext and symbolism archetypes, historical contexts.
i wish i could put you in a historical context right now.
ok, wait, look, megan, we're really sorry about tonight, but we cannot get out of this.
it's like a huge deal.
what is it?
[sighs] whatever.
tell her.
ok.
we signed with a really huge publicist who's helping us get started on, like, career stuff.
[scoffs] megan: what?
look, i promise you it won't get in the way of school stuff, ok?
it already is getting in the way.
no, but we can do both!
i mean, you find time to do your job and all your personal stuff, right?
yeah, but i'm a multitasker at heart.
so that's what we'll be.
unless you don't think we can do it.
which would mean you don't believe in us, which would really suck.
rose, i believe in you girls, but you can't keep skipping study sessions, ok?
hmm. that took forever.
thank you for being so cool about this.
i won't let you down, ok?
bye.
are you not dying to know what their career thing is?
i'm guessing nuclear physics.
i'm kidding!
no, i know.
ugh. they're not usually like that.
well, they were, but i thought we were making so much progress.
meggie, those girls are never going to care about school the way you and i did.
don't kill yourself over it.
well, i guess the good news is is that now i have a night off.
we can get all dolled up and hit the clubs.
what?
!
don't look at me like that!
we are gonna have a real miami night out on the town.
oh, my god, do you remember that guy in postmodern drama with the fake british accent?
oh, he was so annoying!
and he got away with calling professor bernstein bob.
i mean, who does that?
i know!
it is so great having you here.
i miss having a girlfriend around.
i miss you, too.
and i've been thinking.
just hear me out, ok?
you are an amazingly talented writer.
it's silly for you not to be working on something just because of this tutoring job.
i told you, i was going to find a new project.
i just haven't figured out what that is yet.
well, if you ask me, it's staring you right in the face.
uh, pork fried rice?
the effects of msg, extreme bloating?
your life.
think about it.
what you are experiencing right now is outrageous.
i bet the finley review would be very interested in something like this.
i doubt the finley review would be interested in publishing a story about me.
well, not just you.
it would be an expos?
on your life here.
a broke yale graduate-- whose apartment burned down.
whose apartment burned down, gets a job working as a tutor at a fancy palm beach mansion, neighbor to a handsome billionaire who works for minimum wage... who works for minimum wage and probably isn't speaking to me anymore.
see, it totally writes itself.
it's like nanny diaries meets devil wears prada with an edgy, tmz spin.
i couldn't do that.
why not?
it's your story, so you don't have to get anyone's permission.
and you're the one who said that you wanted to stay in palm beach so you can write.
so...why not write this?
that's true, but... it's not so crazy when you think about it.
you've always been so convinced that you wanted to write someone else's biography.
maybe you're supposed to be writing your own.
these are good, will.
some of these are very good.
oh, you really think so?
i wasn't sure about the composition with this batch.
no, i like them, they're good.
oh, no, no, sit down.
it's ok, it's ok, really.
i'm sure the waiter will reappear one of these days.
what?
i've been refilling your coffee for over a year now, peter.
you never had a problem with it before.
i didn't know you would wipe your ass with my paychecks before.
i'm sorry, was that too blunt?
nope.
i get it.
but i hope you can understand why i chose to not tell you about my situation.
money makes most people uncomfortable, and you assumed i was one of those people, which means you must not think very highly of me.
no, that's not the case at all.
well, then what is it, will?
i'm curious.
what goes through the mind of a twenty-something billionaire?
i just didn't want you to question my dedication to this job.
i'm very grateful for the opportunity to work with you and learn from you.
i'm very passionate about photography.
oh, i know you are.
i take this very seriously.
i just needed you to treat me like you treat anybody else.
fair enough.
go on, get me a refill, kid.
no, i'm just kidding.
sit down.
what are you doing?
sit. i'm just messing with you. sit.
really. hey, just out of curiosity... how much are you worth, actually?
* never know how much i love you * * never know how much i care * * when you put your arms around me * * i get a fever that's so hard to bare * * you give me fever *
*when you kiss me * * fever when you hold me tight * * a fever * * in the morning * * fever all through the night * * everybody's got the fever * * that is something you all know *
* fever isn't * * such a new thing * * fever started long ago *
rose baker, people!
was that ok?
are you kidding me?
you are a star, my little lovely.
you are a freaking star!
holly, call lenka's people, tell them we will not need her this weekend after all.
thank them, ok?
you had backup for us?
no, no, no, don't be silly, honey.
it was a whole different thing.
so you really think we were good?
i think you were spectacular!
i mean, when i got that cd, i thought maybe you'd broken out the digital voice enhancer, but you are the real deal.
what about-- what about me?
was i ok?
yes, honey, you looked very pretty.
you just keep doing what you're doing, ok?
all right, listen to me.
have you ever thought about getting into acting?
i mean, with those pipes, what, you could--you could be in the sequel to hairspray!
lucy: i don't think i'd be that good at acting.
yeah, you know what, zac efron said the same thing to me, and look at him now.
sit down for a bit.
ok.
all right, here's the deal.
here's what i want you to do.
i want you... rose?
sage?
caught under a shoe avalanche?
hello?
what's with the furrowed brow?
someone suck all the cream out of your ÉClair?
ugh.
sorry.
sometimes the cooking metaphors go astray.
so where's your brainy gal pal?
she's on the phone with michael chabon.
that's right.
she's schmoozing with pulitzer prize winning novelists, and i'm pretty much a glorified baby-sitter.
not that glorified.
i mean, i could be writing, too, you know.
all right?
i got ideas.
and instead of collaborating with brilliant writers, i'm getting ditched by the girls again.
so why don't you talk to laurel?
i would love to talk to laurel, but she won't take any of my calls.
and she gets all mad about the girls' grades not being good enough, but then she lets them hire a freaking publicist!
i mean, it's like she wants me to fail.
so don't let her.
why not?
i mean, seriously, marco.
why am i the only one busting my ass if nobody cares?
i mean, if nobody wants me around, then why the hell am i here?
ok, if i knew you were throwing a pity party, i would have whipped up some hours d'oeuvres.
i'm sorry.
it's just... i don't know, i thought having caryn here would make me feel better about my life, but it's only made me feel worse.
and i know the race is long, and it's only with myself, but...i don't know, sometimes it's nice just to have a running buddy, you know?
well, if you're looking for someone to commiserate with, why don't you call will?
boy's got real problems.
what kind of problems does will have?
did he forget to charge his golf cart?
no. he lost his job.
they were saying that the deadline might have changed for that?
[mouthing] um, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, they told me about that.
absolutely.
yeah, i am, um, i just want you to know, you know, whatever you need from me.
i mean, i can do copies, i can do it from here, actually.
i'm flying in tomorrow, so i'll be available-- will: hey, this is will.
leave a message and i'll get back to you.
hi.
it's me.
megan...smith.
red hair.
i was, uh, just calling to apologize again.
and to see how you were doing, and you probably hate me right now, which i totally understand.
it's perfectly warranted.
but anyway, if you just want to give me a call back, that would be great, ok?
ok. uh, bye.
yeah. yes.
ok, great, yeah, yeah.
tomorrow at 7:00, i will definitely be there.
girls!
there you are.
oh, you look spectac!
oh, you're sparkly.
ready to work those magic pipes, huh?
well, i guess.
all right, good.
i want to introduce you to perez, all right?
not only can he make anybody famous, but his website is the perfect place to drop your single.
single?
mm-hmm.
stick with me, you'll have an entire album.
you mean me and sage, right?
what?
well, the album.
it'd be for us to do together?
yeah, absolutely.
come on. perez!
whoo!
honey!
hi!
look at you, you are wasting away!
i'll take that as a compliment.
is there any other way to take it?
this is rose baker.
all right?
she is the next amy winehouse-- minus the crack habit.
and this is sage, her sister.
rose is working on some music.
i'm telling you, it's gonna blow you away.
tell him about your music, honey.
is she a mute?
ha ha, you'll have to forgive my sister.
she gets very shy when she talks about her music.
besides, she's saving her voice for the performance.
i understand.
her majesty does the same thing.
love madonna, she's our hero.
in fact, i think our first single will be reminiscent of ray of light, but with a totally retro, beastie boys, run dmc hip-hop vibe.
shut up!
i love it!
i can't wait to hear it.
we can't wait to play it for you.
darling, i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
well, come on, let's take a picture.
there you go.
i amam so sad you're leaving early.
the fun was just getting started.
i know. i wish i could stay!
?
?
did hot neighbor call you back yet?
no.
he's probably still mad at me.
not .?
oh, stop it!
it is not your fault he got fired, ok?
and if he is mad at you, he's just another palm beach idiot.
end of story.
so listen, i, um, i spoke to my boss about your article.
he's very interested.
what article?
well, i presented it as an article, but you know, you could always write it as a first chapter, and then maybe we could do a book like gopnik did with paris to the moon-- whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, caryn.
back up. i never said i was going to be writing that piece.
how could you not?
it's--it's such a great idea.
it's not like i can write that while i'm still working here, and i'm certainly not in any position to be quitting right now.
no, why would you quit?
no, it's way better if you stay here longer, anyway.
you get more dirt that way.
i don't care about the dirt.
that's not the kind of writing that i want to do.
and...more importantly, that's not the kind of person that i want to be.
you wouldn't be writing anything that isn't true.
i mean, laurel is an ice queen, and those girls are vapid princesses who can't read a book without cucumber water.
hey!
i'm overstating for dramatic purposes, but you know what i mean.
they're not like that at all, and the fact that you're judging them so harshly without even knowing them-- oh, you are being way too sensitive here, ok?
it's called journalism.
no, it's not journalism.
it's tacky and cheap and i'm not going to do it.
you're really putting me in a bad situation, megan, ok?
i already told my boss we were gonna do this, and he got all excited.
well, you shouldn't have done that!
why do you care about these people so much?
they obviously don't give a crap about you.
we're going through a rough patch.
it's not always like this.
i-i don't even know you right now.
the megan i knew would have killed for an opportunity like this.
this is the kind of situation you and i used to dream about-- no!
it's not.
and if you ever thought that i was the kind of person that would intentionally hurt someone just to get ahead at a stupid magazine, then...you really didn't know me at all.
i'll talk to you later.
i wonder how long it'll take before our pictures are posted online.
[yawns] oh, i don't know.
oh, you were so good with perez.
i still cannot get over it.
wasn't he so nice?
yeah.
?
oh, without a doubt.
i can't believe orlando bloom gave you his phone number.
are you going to call him?
hello?
what?
oh, never mind.
we'll do a recap later.
i'm exhausted.
yeah, me, too.
i didn't know we'd be out that late.
get some rest.
you got a lot of bragging to do at school tomorrow.
yeah, and our first final.
oh, right.
blecch!
megan: where's the butler when you need him?
you were actually going to leave without saying good-bye?
i didn't think you'd want to talk to me.
come on.
don't you remember some of the blowout fights we had in college?
last night wouldn't have even registered on the richter scale.
i do remember a broken lamp once.
i'm sorry if i put you in an awkward position with your boss.
it's not your fault.
i shouldn't have been so presumptuous.
i truly never thought the article would be an issue.
unintentional magazine pun.
look, you obviously care a great deal about these people.
not sure i understand why, but...
it's not my place to judge.
i know how it seems, but the truth is, i'm responsible for a lot of what's going on around here lately.
laurel does have the right to be mad at me, and i did overstep my boundaries.
and the girls are smart!
meggie!
no, no, no, i'm serious.
i mean, they may not care about school right now, but i want them to have choices later on in their lives, and i feel like it's my job to make sure that happens.
i know it sounds stupid.
no, it does not sound stupid.
it sounds like you.
look, this family may not know how lucky they are to have you, but i do.
oh, there's my cab.
all right.
ok.
and i promise to keep writing while i'm down here.
?
good.
call me when you land.
i will. bye.
that was a quick trip.
laurel... um, i'm glad you're here.
do you have a minute?
i just want you to know that i took a look at the girls' grades, and you were right.
they do need to step it up, and i need to step it up.
so to that end i added another study session to their schedule.
they've been a little distracted lately, and i just need to get their focus back.
fine.
so, did you have a nice time with your friend?
yeah.
it was nice to see her.
crossed my mind that you might have been inclined to book a ticket home with her.
if you don't want me here anymore, laurel, i can leave. we don't need to make a big deal about it, nobody needs to know why.
but for whatever it's worth, i want to stay.
working for you has... it's been everything that i'd hoped it would be.
ok. well, at least i can see the potential.
i know that things haven't been easy for you these past few weeks.
i haven't been easy on you.
in my position, it's difficult to place one's trust in anyone.
i understand.
more than ever, i understand.
and i plan to prove my loyalty to you for as long as it takes.
i appreciate that.
you know, i was impressed with you the first time i met you.
it's quite a relief to think my instincts might not have been wrong after all.
len just flew these in from fauchon, paris.
shall we indulge?
you have 55 minutes to complete your essays.
remember the three cs-- clear, cogent, concise.
good luck.
will: you busy?
oh, no, no, no.
no, no, no.
i was just-- rewriting your apology letter to me?
make sure you spellcheckspell-checkit.
don't laugh.
i've drafted a few pretty pathetic emails just in case you never call me back.
i would never not call you back.
i still want to apologize.
you don't have to.
no, yes, i do.
i feel terrible.
i should never have said anything.
it's ok.
i still cannot believe that your boss would fire you over this.
not only is it unfair, it's so totally illegal!
in fact, you know what?
give me his phone number.
ok?
because i can be really scary on the phone.
oh, i'm sure you can.
and it's nice of you to offer to go to bat for me like that, but honestly, it's all good.
i wasn't fired.
i quit.
you quit?
yeah.
well, the more i thought about it, it was time to move on.
i've been playing it safe for a while now.
you have?
i have.
maybe all this happened for a reason.
you know, force me to step it up a notch and see what else is out there.
so, in a way, i helped.
in a way.
well, good, good, that is good.
because i'm about to help some more, because i'm very good at the next part.
and what's the next part?
rÉSumÉS, job hunting, interviews.
i so totally rock at the interview.
you wouldn't think so, because of my whole nervous talking thing, but it can be pretty helpful in hiring situations.
is that right?
definitely.
we'll put together a really professional portfolio.
i have a label maker.
of course you do.
organization is the key.
the first thing that we will do is send out about 20 emails and see what...
comes back. i... you know, i found it best to stagger everything--
wait.
what?
i think i left my label maker in my old apartment.
i'll get a new one.
* Goodbye, no handshake to endure * * Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow *
* There's nothing new in dying now * * Though living is no newer *
The unthinkable had occurred.
It was on April 26, 1945.
The Russian army had encircled Berlin and was advancing on the Reichstag, street by street.
You could see the sun behind the clouds that day... and the scent of lilacs wafted over from abandoned gardens.
Where do I start?
What are the right words?
As a journalist I had travelled to 12 countries.
I had lived in Moscow, Paris and London.
I enjoyed living in Paris and London.
But I came back.
I wanted to be part of it.
My name doesn't matter.
I was just one of many who believed in my country's destiny.
Doubts... were for the weak.
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
A never-ending triumph.
Russia lacks leadership.
By the time they recover, we'll be in Moscow.
Sorry for barging in, but we happen to be at war.
The day Gerd left, his boots echoed through the house.
We were convinced we were right.
We all breathed the same air and it was intoxicating.
He helped me out of my coat...
The Russians have no idea what's going to hit them.
We were off to the Sorbonne, chattering away in French.
And he thought I was one of those big, blond Swedes.
I skipped to get in step with him.
Then he stopped and said,
Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer.
And that was the end of that.
A shame.
One moment!
Without music...
I'd like us... to take a moment to think of our men who are scattered across Europe... and, in doing so, include them in this evening.
Run!
Get out of here!
Go!
Come here!
Get in there!
Hurry!
No uniforms and no weapons, or they'll shoot us.
Felix, where are you?
Anyone see my son?
No news.
No orders.
Nothing!
Nobody gives a damn about us.
Lenchen?
!
Where are you?
In some parts of town they're even welcoming them.
Russian swine!
They had been booksellers.
They sometimes spoke French.
And that's the pharmacist's widow.
Her husband once cured Hindenburg of a headache.
That's all over.
Now we step on the corpses of dead women just to get at a jar of jam.
That is Frau Binder, a musician.
Her husband is missing.
Can someone help me?
She can't breathe!
She...
Look at me!
I'll write it all down,
Gerd, for you to read.
Like some?
Thanks.
She's from Silesia.
Too much to take.
Hurry!
Get under there!
Mami?
Don't be afraid, I'm here.
Halt!
Residents of Berlin!
Residents of this street!
All weapons must be handed over at once!
This is your last chance.
Surrender your weapons!
This is your last chance.
Go ahead!
There!
Move!
Go to the top!
Move back!
Careful!
This way!
Hurry!
Careful!
Comrade Colonel!
The men have almost reached the station.
The order was to proceed to the Reichstag.
Yes, sir, comrade Colonel!
No Reichstag?
Why not?
It's so close!
We're going on, dammit!
That's an order!
Secure the flanks!
You hear me?
What...what do you want?
You speak Russian?
Russian?
Come!
Eat.
War kaput.
Eat.
War kaput, woman.
No afraid.
No afraid.
We won't let them bury us here.
Woman, come!
No afraid!
Come, come!
No afraid!
Come!
Pretty girls!
Come here!
Be nice and you'll get something to eat!
Potatoes, very good.
May I?
Who knows how this works?
Hey, Ukrainian, do you know?
So here are our Soviet liberators!
Overjoyed, obviously amazed at themselves for getting this far.
I know them, their sandals, villages and shabby new buildings, they're so proud of.
They won't strain themselves.
Hey!
Urine!
Try some urine!
That's enough!
No, seriously...
Your urine is too old.
I used urine to get my General in Leningrad back on his feet...
Come on!
It's true!
Just what are they doing there?
Please!
Husband?
Husband and two children.
Come!
Now!
Let me through!
No!
You don't belong here!
Let me go!
I didn't do a thing!
Most of my countrymen are now very clever when it comes to saving their own skins.
You're endangering all of us!
The Silesian girl was an easy victim.
Go on!
Here, hurry.
The attic apartment on the right.
Hurry!
Go on!
Take it and go!
Go on!
Say something!
You speak Russian!
You can't let them do this!
Pretty woman!
Soldier!
Why do you take a woman... who has no desire?
Willing women are dirty.
Open up!
Not here.
Where?
We're almost there.
Stop!
Come back!
Commander...
I'm looking for a commander.
What's wrong?
Are you the commander?
I...
We need help.
Are you the commander?
Lots of commanders.
We're all commanders.
Which one do you want?
Major...
We need your help.
All our men are healthy.
Frau Hitler!
Our country is in ruins.
Gerd, remember your first words?
You said, 'Thirty minutes'.
Give me thirty minutes and you'll never leave me.
God help us!
The back hallway.
The widow offered me a place to stay.
She led the way... to an apartment that was surprisingly intact.
I accepted.
And here...
You can stay here for the time being.
The move was easy.
A few steps up to my studio.
A blouse, a few books and some notes.
You can stay if you like.
Thanks.
I'd like that.
Take care.
I should have looked around a little.
But we never see everything.
And the story took its course.
This was a nice place.
How... did you find me?
I searched every cellar.
How often?
Often.
The riverbanks are dressed in green.
The trees breathe lightly, deeply.
We go on fighting courageously.
In the last Battle of this war.
It was a long way to this May.
It cost a lot of strength and courage.
But now we're free again.
And we proudly stand guard!
Hello, May!
Our soldiers and US weapons...
They'd be gone!
Yes.
Yesterday at the pump, it was my turn and somebody came up with two Iron Crosses and one German Cross in gold.
And he took my bucket gallantly.
I said, 'What an honour, I'm not used to this'.
He said,
You have to be strong, ma'am.
Because if the Russians do just a fraction of what we did to them during the last four years... and he said... then presently no German would be left alive.
Presently?
Nobody says that any more.
I have a question.
How do I say, 'Excuse me, do you have a dictionary?
'
He doesn't need one for what he wants.
Lenchen!
Come with us!
Go with them?
Where to?
Our house was stormed for the next few days.
Day and night.
One woman hung herself.
Another was shot and killed.
Nobody... was spared.
Every feeling is dead.
Lenchen!
What's that?
A map.
Where are you going?
Come over here!
Over there!
Stand up, wretched of the Earth who are forced to starve.
Reason thunders in its volcano.
This is the eruption of the end.
Go away!
I...
I love you!
Hello.
Please don't!
My lovely!
I come back.
My lovely.
I'm a young man.
You startled me.
We'll survive.
At all costs.
Where to?
We're here!
Where are they now?
Our rescuers?
The great armies?
War and dying used to be men's business.
That's all over.
Damn Russians!
Officer, General, Commander.
I go for the highest rank.
Starting now, I decide who gets me.
No, no, no.
Out of there!
It's still my bed!
You can protect us on the couch.
Look it up: 'Protect'.
Like this!
You don't have to sleep in my bed.
Did you understand me?
Where's the Major?
Wait.
Fraulein!
Who are you looking for?
Hey, Blondie!
Why so glum?
How about scrubbing my back with soap?
Who would you like to talk to?
You.
Dismissed!
May I sit down?
No!
Our building was stormed yesterday and many women raped.
I know nothing of it.
It is your duty to help.
Help who?
My people or yours?
Me.
What do those few minutes matter?
It's pointless.
You speak Russian?
What do you look for?
Looking for officers?
Officer?
All with their women.
But I am here.
Lieutenant, may I speak with you?
Several balconies in our house are booby-trapped.
Can you help us?
Too bad.
Fraulein!
You and me, tonight?
Me Anatoi.
You and me...
It's that simple.
It was then I swore that nobody would touch me, unless I let them.
No matter what.
Come in!
Follow us!
Time to go to your friends.
Hey!
That is my husband!
Don't you understand?
My husband!
You must understand.
All people are bad.
I don't understand him.
He won't leave.
What are you doing?
This is mahogany!
Calm down!
Go to the kitchen!
Me, Charkov!
He comes from Charkov.
Me industrial Clerk.
Accountant.
No!
Me accountant!
You accountant!
We accountant!
Everything good!
That is life.
Understand?
You, lovely!
These Russians are great.
So full of life!
It's about time all this shit was over.
Right, when I get back to Charkov,
I'll get married and build a house, have kids, work on a collective farm and he'll be my accountant.
Are you a professional soldier?
No.
Me...dairy!
Milk!
Dairy?
Cow!
That's interesting.
No interesting!
Milk... and milk.
All shit!
Look at this!
My trophies!
That's nothing!
Here!
This is a trophy!
That's no trophy!
Here!
Look at this!
This is a real trophy.
My present to the ladies!
For them to kiss!
Where toilet?
Toilet in hallway.
Thank you.
Like something else to eat?
You.
Want my cock?
Does not matter who!
Cock is cock!
Why Russia?
Why?
What's wrong with you people?
Why Russia?
This is Major...
I'm afraid I've forgotten his name.
He's the battalion commander.
They don't have a commandant.
Did you know,
German is the first foreign language they learn?
It takes a war for us to discover that.
Can I do anything for you?
Hey, Mongolian!
Did you come here from Moscow to get water for a German?
Or is our Major bathing in essence of roses?
A German product!
I'm responsible for the Major.
Go on, I'll be there shortly.
Go on!
Get moving, Mongolian!
Get moving!
Go!
Run, Mongolian!
Then a bomb landed in the neighbour's yard and turned the whole house into kindling.
And their pig was blown to pieces!
And no longer edible.
Here!
Let go, Masha!
Please excuse my behaviour.
Dismissed.
Berlin is ours!
Here!
I told them all to leave.
May I sit down?
Come over here.
As you wish.
No?
The raping continues.
They are everywhere, in every home.
We are Russians now.
At their service.
And we women will have to keep silent.
Or no man will ever want to touch us again.
Poor Germany.
Take me with you.
Nineteen soldiers.
Four!
Four women!
Berlin is one big whorehouse!
Look at this!
They have everything!
They have jewels!
Money!
Houses!
And they make war!
Bastards!
Enough!
What do I think about them?
Sometimes I feel I could put up with anything.
As long as it comes from without and doesn't ambush me from within my heart.
I'm doing fine.
And my Russian is getting better.
Was someone here?
No.
What a greeting!
Madame, I've brought you a suitor.
Anatol is a Gypsy.
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protector.
My sunshine.
Do you think... think the Fuhrer will abandon us?
No.
Never.
Here.
Is that all?
My head aches.
Where are you going?
To get you something to eat, if it's the last thing I do.
Why the Reichstag?
Fuck him!
And fuck the Reichstag!
Then he grabbed me and threw me on the bed, and suddenly he became very boring
like a little puppy.
And afterwards he made me a compliment.
He said,
'Ukrainians like this'.
'And you like this'.
But... he had such bad breath.
Oh, it's you!
Good morning.
We're bringing you breakfast.
The next morning, a few blocks away the war was raging, the Major came with all his men.
Good morning.
Morning.
The widow who could be had for a scrap of bacon buzzed around like a bee.
And Herr Eckart, our Volkssturm man, was ready to surrender.
This way!
Russian horse.
What's this?
Sugar!
We have sugar!
And bacon and salami...
What a delight!
But not for everyone.
Then came the cavalry, coats flying, swords raised, horses panting.
When a horse charges, it has incredible strength.
And the whole avalanche charged the tanks, the artillery, the machine guns.
Destroyed them all!
Your soldiers outnumbered us, but they dropped their guns and ran away.
German soldiers!
Soldiers, officers, everyone!
Afraid!
Don't be so rude.
We didn't start the war.
Sit down!
And stop insulting our hosts.
Enough!
Me the Caucasus Mountains.
Understand?
Caucasus Mountains big, so beautiful.
Sun, mountains, blue sky!
Beautiful dances and women!
As sweet as raisin.
And Pushkin was there in exile.
I don't care about Pushkin.
I want to go home.
Home, understand?
To my wife and kids.
You see?
And you say Pushkin?
I want my wife.
My wife.
Understand?
What do you know about fascism?
Fascism?
It comes from Fascio.
It means 'Bundle of Reeds'.
Very old.
Roman.
To our hostess!
Right!
A woman who is obviously smart!
Just like you!
Very smart!
I'm no woman!
To German Russian friendship!
Hurrah!
Search every apartment!
Out!
You bastard!
You scum!
Stop!
Enough!
You know Stalin's decree!
Just stop!
What if I don't?
Will you shoot me?
If I have to, I'll shoot you.
He's acting on my orders.
Halt!
A young German stole some food.
He's armed.
Who lives up there?
Who lives there?
Does anyone live there?
No.
You're lying!
You're a lying bitch!
I spit on Germany and Berlin!
We defeated them!
I spit on them!
Out of my way!
Halt!
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Everyone in possession of a weapon or who hides someone in possession of a weapon will be shot at once!
And the house will be razed!
They'll never forgive you!
Can I have something to drink?
You have to leave.
What are you doing here?
I'm not going to Siberia.
I'm not going.
The next few days the Major came and went.
It meant protection for everyone.
He brought candles, cigars and lots of presents which the widow quickly stowed away in her cupboard.
In a way, a new era was beginning.
A lot of Russian men like to play Santa Claus.
Why should we women stop them?
That's way too much!
The Major speaks eloquent Russian and he told me more than I wanted to know.
I know his bank account, his parent's and his brother's names.
You're our guest today.
Now sit down.
You are so old-fashioned.
I love to touch him.
Let's go!
The war raged on.
While our men were being sent to Siberia, many women sought protectors and became taboo for the rest.
Careful!
It's a Singer.
Not much further.
Hold it up!
In and out, in and out!
It's like a train station in here.
Mussolini is dead!
They hung him upside down!
Andrei had scarcely left when Anatol showed up.
I was scared to death the two alpha males would meet with me in the middle.
I can't really say the Major rapes me.
I am at his disposal.
A whore?
Perhaps.
I only met a whore once in my life.
People said not to talk to her, that she was bad.
What does that mean anyway?
Bad.
Young lady!
No!
Well, well...
Along she comes as if everything were fine.
How often?
Four times.
You?
Come on!
I never thought I'd see you again!
You look good!
You do!
Here, quince jam.
A real Bordeaux!
Take it!
How classy!
You're spoiled!
That's one way of putting it.
I'm so happy you're here.
Elke's visit cheered us all up.
The Major's guards protect us as we drink his tea in peace.
It does us the world of good.
Where are you going?
What's it to you?
You can't go in.
Who's there?
So I said, 'Young man... that rifle on your shoulder could accidentally go off'.
And me?
I was going upstairs, and somebody on the 2nd floor fired a shot from inside and grabbed me by the hair and said, 'You syphilis'.
I was terrified and said,
'No, not me!
'
What an idiot.
How's your husband?
He was with me the first time and is still a bit disturbed.
What do you think of our cavaliers?
Not impressed.
They have no imagination.
At home they may have the latest planned economy, but when it comes to eroticism, they're like Adam and Eve.
That's what I told my husband.
With our scanty rations, your good old husband isn't worth much either.
Well...
I guess for a good love life you need regular meals.
My focal point is my belly.
No food, no fun.
Romance, pain, love, lust...
To us!
Cheers!
Who knows when we'll meet again!
Careful!
It's hot!
Apple pie!
Yes, with crumble.
It's singing to me.
You, you, you're in my heart
You, you, you're on my mind
You, you cause me such pain
You don't know just how good I am Oh, yes...
You don't know just how good I am
Our men aren't what they used to be, either.
They're so weak it's hard just to look at them.
The weaker sex.
Have you heard from Gerd?
I have a question about syphilis.
Oh, God!
How do you notice it?
itching, stinging.
And little boils.
They show up later.
I read it in an encyclopedia.
An encyclopedia!
Here, an American gave me this.
Chew it!
Cool, huh?
Americans...
They all look like actors.
Handsome, like from the movies.
I'm going.
Tell her
I'll be back!
Hear me?
What is it?
A mission.
Can we count on you?
When the day comes.
I'll be here.
Where will you go...
later?
Where I'm needed.
A special evening with the Major.
A good conversation.
He said I was marvellous.
Nothing else mattered to him.
Contrary to German men, Russian men appreciated educated women.
But... the war wasn't over yet.
Excuse me.
Do you have a moment?
We...
We need your help.
Come on, kids.
Leave the room.
We'll finish building your tower.
It's him.
Hello.
You Russian?
Translate!
In my village, German soldiers... killed all the children.
They took them... stabbed them.
They grabbed them by the feet...
Go on!
threw them... against the walls and... smashed their skulls.
Hearsay?
Or did you see it?
I saw it.
Hey, what's the hurry?
Did you forget your underwear?
You speak Russian!
Tell him I have a family!
Tell him to leave me alone!
You speak Russian!
Help!
Where are you going?
I was waiting for you.
What's wrong?
Comrade Major.
Old Germany is finished.
Keep your hands off him!
He comes to me.
I don't go to him.
Go away!
Why?
You people hung his wife.
Residents of Berlin!
On 30 April, 1945 the Fuhrer killed himself,
and betrayed all those who swore allegiance to him.
The Fuhrer's orders were for you to defend Berlin.
But the lack of heavy artillery and ammunition and the entire situation make any further fighting meaningless.
Every hour you go on fighting prolongs the dreadful suffering of Berlin's civilian population and of our wounded.
All those who now die in the battle for Berlin are sacrificing themselves for nothing.
In agreement with the Supreme Command of the Soviet Army, I order you to immediately cease all combat operations.
Weidling,
General of the Artillery and Commander of the Defence Area of Berlin.
Comrade soldiers and officers of the 8th Red Army, this morning, the Berlin Garrison surrendered!
Berlin is defeated.

I'm going back to my people.
To Siberia?
What about us?
Talk to me, Friedrich!
Please!
Talk to me!
I waited for you!
I prayed.
And I hoped.
I prayed and hoped.
And now I want you to at least try
to stand by me.
To victory!
Berlin is defeated!
To the homeland!
Long live the Red Army!
Long live Stalin!
Just a moment!
What do we have here?
Two halibuts!
Unbelievable!
Hitler, Goebbels...kaput!
Great!
Let's drink!
Capitulation.
At long last.
The war is over!
How we women longed for that.
But now?
A very bitter defeat.
More and more people are talking about horrific things.
I sense an eerie something in the air.
Evil and menacing.
I don't want to think about it now.
It's all over.
I don't know.
I fear that misfortune has a greater imagination.
Listen.
They are drinking and smoking like men.
The Russian Army has one million women.
They come from everywhere.
We have no uniforms.
The boots are too large.
Shirts and jackets...a disaster.
One of the girls came to me.
I think her name was Luba.
She said,
'Major, I believe I will be killed today'.
'I want fresh clothes'.
I said, 'No!
'
You've been with us for a long time.
The bullets avoid you.
She came back two hours later.
And again and again.
So I said, 'Yes'.
She got a new shirt with ribbons here.
As white as snow.
It was full of blood.
Every female soldier is afraid of not being pretty when she dies.
Are you a Fascist?
Where are you going?
They're all taken!
The battalion commander?
That's what I like about you Mongolians.
Not a word too many.
1,678 days
I've been at war.
And now...
And she...
She's a whore, right?
The whole place is a whorehouse.
You come with me!
A gun, huh?
Peace, huh?
War kaput!
Get there, I said!
Everybody downstairs!
Hurry!
Everybody downstairs!
Let's go!
Halt!
Where's the gun from?
Whose apartment is it?
Whose?
Mine.
Is this hers?
It's hers.
This is a violation of Red Army regulations!
Long live the Fuhrer!
Liquidate her!
I hope you all die!
Did you know about the gun?
No.
Go back to your apartments.
Shoot them all!
Go on!
Halt!
They're all liars!
Shoot them!
Forget the woman!
She's a Nazi!
Did you understand me?
No.
You will be questioned first.
Did you understand me?
What are you doing?
She hid an armed soldier!
That's grounds for execution!
Go!
I'll have to report this.
Torch them!
How could you risk that?
You jeopardised us all!
Got the Nazi monster in its own burrow.
The garrison of the German capital has capitulated.
Traitor!
Me go all Berlin!
Hotel Adlon, Wedding, Kaiserdamm!
Everywhere red flags!
Red flags!
Nice flags, good quality.
What's wrong?
Fighting?
Stop staring!
Go on!
What's wrong?
To our victory, Commander!
To Stalin!
To Stalin!
Wait!
Stay with your people!
The war is over!
Here!
I've got them.
Just you look.
Ljuba, Marina, Olga, Thekla.
And they all love me.
All of them.
Everything good?
Want something to eat?
Here!
What's better?
Tell me!
His prick or my bike?
Get out before I shoot your balls off!
We're celebrating.
Everybody, come!
The whole house!
It's an order!
Your Hitler is no human!
He is stinking filth.
No human!
Filth!
Lenchen, they're yelling upstairs!
Everybody!
Come up!
It's an order!
Fill it up.
Why are you standing around?
We have guests.
Why afraid?
Look down there.
You see...?
Soldiers.
Russians!
Beasts!
Or animals, as you say.
That's right.
Not one of us would hesitate a second to shoot a German.
Your blood is on our uniforms and that's good.
None of them wanted to go to war.
Most of them didn't even know what it was...
Germany.
And now come with me.
What is going on here?
Careful!
It's mahogany!
Let me go!
You dance!
Are you crazy?
This is my living room and not a dance hall.
You understand?
Fantastic!
Not a dance hall!
Drink schnapps.
Vodka, schnapps good.
You...
Sing?
He wants me to sing.
I'm not going to sing.
What does he want?
What do you think?
No.
What do you mean 'no'?
No, no, no...
This is Europe!
Europe!
Why not?
I look at you.
And you?
Nothing!
Next time!
To you!
Me Anatol.
I know.
Barbel.
My heart calls out:
Barbel...
I play the violin.
The violin.
Fiddle.
You play the piano?
In an orchestra, but not any more.
My violin is gone.
That's good.
I want to play the piano, too.
Why don't you go upstairs?
Should I?
Why not?
We all should.
Will you come, too?
Later.
Really?
Sure.
It's good to have you here.
I want to embrace you.
For the rest of my life.
Me here, you in Moscow.
Nobody has arms that long.
Try!
The Major asked me to call him Andrei.
'Why not', I said.
The war is over.
He gazed at me for a long time.
Every newborn child yells for war, he said.
And that nothing, no person or nation, could stop that cycle.
Except death.
Not fast enough!
Faster!
Everybody!
Listen!
And now the song...
I Am So In Love With You.
Dance!
Come on!
We're no longer a people.
We're a population.
I mean individuals who come together in a democracy and work hard for prosperity.
Dance!
We shouldn't see it within a small framework.
European countries will overcome their borders and grow together.
Like Napoleon, the victorious powers will get rid of countries and nations.
And we'll become a Soviet republic with planned economy nonsense!
Thank you.
I...
Herr Hoch, feeling better?
We have to be practical.
Things will get better.
Not so fast!
Drink!
Drink!
The Soviet Union has just started to develop.
The future will tell.
You love your country.
Just as I love mine.
My mother once said
I would marry a man who plays the piano.
Everyone always wondered what this day would be like.
Not me.
Never.
I didn't want to experience it.
Why not?
If you don't tell me, then I'll tell you, Andrei.
War changes our words.
Love is no longer what it once was.
And still...
I still want... my husband to find the woman... he left behind.
Don't go!
We women have been branded for life.
But for the time being, at this very moment,
I feel just fine.
I'll get us tea.
Ilse has some.
Morning, Lenchen.
Is anybody up yet?
Where's Vanya?
At work.
And Mama?
Ilse, come on, get up!
Gerd, do you remember?
It was a Tuesday.
Let's go and see Felix.
We could smell the pine resin.
Want to?
We were engulfed in a cloud of butterflies.
And you knew each one by name.
Common blue, Brimstone,
Firebird, Swallowtail and so many more.
One was sunning itself on the path, velvet brown, yellow and blue trim.
You said it was a Mourning Cloak.
I've had so many things in my life, an over-abundance.
The Major lost everything.
Damn Russian idealist!
He sees himself the way he wants the world to be.
A Soviet true believer!
But I like him.
The less he wants from me, the more I like him.
Very much.
Andrei?
Andrei is no longer here.
Transferred.
Where to?
Who knows?
Goodbye.
'The birds are silent.
The bells are hushed'.
Isn't that how it goes?
Sit down.
The studio?
Is it gone?
I don't live here alone.
I know.
Ukrainians like this...
Here, for you.
You're all shameless.
Don't you realise that?
It's disgusting just to look at you!
Attention!
I want to thank you.
What for?
Being allowed to know you.
Take care of yourself.
How do we go on living?
Attention!
Transferred!
That's what they call it.
An honourable transfer.
To Siberia.
Who knows?
Gerd, my beloved Gerd.
What do we do now?
Turn back the hands of time?
Back to the first words you said.
You said, '30 minutes'.
Just give me 30 minutes and you'll never leave me.
What?
No answer.
Two days later he was gone.
I don't know if he'll be back.
I'm surprised it doesn't hurt any more.
But I have so much to do.
I have to find a flint stone.
Mop up the puddles in the studio and scavenge for greens.
I found some lilacs yesterday.
Does Gerd ever think of me?
Who knows?
Maybe his heart will speak again and I'll see him...
Someday.
WHEN THE DIARY 'ANONYMA:
THE DOWNFALL OF BERLIN'
WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN GERMANY IN 1959,
IT WAS INDIGNANTLY REJECTED, IT WAS A DISGRACE TO GERMAN WOMEN.
SHOCKED BY THE CONTEMPT OF HER CONTEMPORARIES,
THE AUTHOR FORBID FURTHER PUBLISHING OF HER BOOK UNTIL HER DEATH.
AND EVEN AFTER SHE WAS GONE, HER NAME WAS TO BE KEPT SECRET.
(Music)
Anonyma
A Woman in Berlin
(woman's voice) Who would've thought that?
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin and now they were heading towards the Reichstag.
On this day, you could see the sun behind the clouds, and the smell of lilac wafted through all the smoke.
How to start?
How to find the right words?
I've been a journalist, I've traveled 12 countries.
Been living in Moscow, Paris and London.
I really liked to stay in Paris and London.
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.
My name doesn't matter.
I am one of the many who fervently believed in our country's future.
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.
(Gerd) Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.
The Russians don't have a leader.
When they finally come to their senses, we are already knocking at their front door in Moscow.
Pardon our pushiness, but it's war after all.
Gerd hated railway stations.
When he left, the sound of his boots filled the house.
We were certain to do the right thing, we breathed the same air as everybody else.
We were part of this.
And then he takes off my coat and says:
The Russians have no idea what's coming towards them.
So we were heading towards the Sorbonne and chatting away in French.
He thought that I was one of those tall blond Swedes.
Then I made a double step to match my stride to his.
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.
Hold on.
I...
I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.
I would like for us all to share this moment, this wonderful evening, with our husbands who are stationed somewhere all over Europe.
(Explosions)
Get lost!
Run, run!
Get away!
(woman) Go away!
(officer) Houses on the right.
Fan out.
(honking)
(Soldiers singing)
Come here, damn it!
(child) Mummy, where are you?
Come on.
Hurry.
(Soldier) Away.
Go away.
Open fire, reload grenade.
...and fire!
Fire!
Shit.
- Wait for me.
- Watch out!
Heads down.
- There you are.
- Stop!
Wait for me.
Watch out!
(woman) No!
No uniforms, no weapons, or it's martial law.
(Russian)
(woman) Felix, where are you?
Felix?
- Where the hell is he?
Felix?
- Not a single order.
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.
Felix?
Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?
In Wedding district, they are already showing their toddlers to the Russians.
Russian pigs.
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.
And that's the pharmacist's widow.
Her husband once cured Minister Hindenburg's headache.
That's over.
Now you step on the face and the arms of a dead woman only to get a glass of jelly.
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician.
Her husband is MIA.
(Screaming)
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.
Look at me.
Look at me!
I will write all of this down, I will report it.
Gerd, and you shall read it.
May I offer you something?
Thank you.
From Silesia.
She won't make it.
(Music)
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.
They're coming.
(Russian)
Halt!
(Announcement) Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.
All fire arms have to be turned in immediately.
This is the last warning.
Attention, attention.
This is the last warning.
(Russian)
Attack!
Upstairs!
All the way upstairs!
Go away!
Not now!
Attention!
(Russian)
I...
I have... (whispering in Russian)
Careful!
Comrade Colonel.
The troops have almost reached Potsdam station.
But the order was to go towards the government district!
Understood, Comrade Colonel.
We'll stay here.
Major!
I thought we were going to the Reichstag.
No Reichstag?
But why not, we are so close.
Screw it, we are not staying here!
That's an order!
Retreat!
Secure our flank!
Understood?
Soldiers?
Officers?
Weapons?
I said:
Soldiers?
Officers?
(woman) They will see soon enough.
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.
Get out!
One person at a time.
Get out, all of you!
Move it!
- Russian filth!
- Up!
What... do you want?
Russian?
Yes.
Russian!
Come.
Come.
Eat.
War kaput.
Woman.
Come!
Eat.
War kaput, woman.
Come on.
No fear.
No fear.
We will not die here.
Bravo, come, come.
Don't be afraid.
Come.
Don't shiver!
Good!
Come.
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.
You be nice and you'll get something to eat.
Potatoes.
Very good.
May I?
(soldiers laughing)
(Music)
Does anybody know how this thing works?
You, Ukrainian, do you know it?
There they are, our Russian liberators.
Full of joy.
It seems they can hardly believe that they've made it this far.
I know them, their sandals and villages.
Their rapidly constructed new buildings they are so proud of.
Stop!
They are without any constraints.
Don't move, asshole!
Leave her.
Get lost.
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?
That's enough!
No, seriously...
Your urine is much too old.
Back in Leningrad, I put my general back on his feet with urine...
You storyteller!
It's true.
What are they doing?
Please!
Please!
Have you husband?
A husband and two children.
Come anyway.
Quick, quick!
(woman) Let me through!
Let me through!
No, no, you pigs.
You pigs!
No!
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.
Stop.
- You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
(man) Come on, don't be so prude.
Most fellow countrymen adeptly saved their own hides.
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.
Leave!
Mrs. Hitler.
You slut!
Where to?
To the Fuhrer?
Here.
Quick.
Penthouse to the right.
Quick!
Go!
Take this and go!
Go!
Come.
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.
Soldier!
Why are you taking a woman... who doesn't want you?
Willing women are unclean.
(Door is closed)
Open the door!
Open it!
Open the door, you bastards!
Open it!
(Music)
Not here.
- Where?
- Almost there.
Stop!
Stay where you are!
Hey you.
Shoo shoo!
Commander...
I am looking for the commanding officer.
What's up?
Are you in charge here?
I... we need help.
Are you in charge here?
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.
Which one do you want?
Major, sir...
We need your help...
Our men are all healthy and clean.
(car departs)
Mrs. Hitler.
Our country is finished.
Gerd, do you remember your first words?
"Give me 30 minutes and you will never want to leave me again."
God almighty.
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.
She took me by the hand and just led me inside her undestroyed apartment.
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.
Moving places was easy: a blouse, a few books and notebooks.
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.
(Russians singing)
Take good care of yourself.
In spite of everything, it would have been good to have a closer look around.
But then, we never know everything, so that's how the story continued.
I guess it has been really nice here once.
How did you find me here?
I searched every cellar.
How often?
Often.
The shores are clad in green, the trees are breathing freely and deeply
We bravely stride on and on, towards the final assault in this war!
Our path was long to reach this day in May.
It has cost us much strength and courage.
But now we are free again!
We proudly take our positions.
Greetings, May.
Our soldiers and a few American weapons, and those would be history.
Yeah.
(Russians cheering)
Yesterday at the water pump, it was my turn, a guy approaches me,
two Iron Crosses and one German Cross in Gold on his chest, and he gallantly takes the buckets out of my hands.
And I say:
"How do I deserve this honor?" and he says "We can't give up now"
"because if the Russian even remotely does to us
"what we did to them during the last four years,
"in the near future there won't be any living Germans left."
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin!
We made it!
How do you say:
Excuse me, do you have a dictionary?
I guess he doesn't need a dictionary for what he wants.
(banging)
Lenchen!
(unintelligible)
Come with us!
Come where?
Lenchen!
During the next few days, our house was raided day and night.
Lenchen!
One woman hanged herself, another one was shot to death.
None of us was spared.
Every emotion is dead.
Hey, you from Berlin!
Over here!
Upstairs.
What kept you so long?
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.
Forever!
Lenchen.
- What have you got there?
- A map.
Move it!
Faster.
You go left, I go right.
Where are you going?
Come to us.
Come.
Wake up, damned of the earth, who are living in hunger and misery.
Justice is about to burst through like glowing magma in a volcano.
You just go away, away!
I!
I love you.
Good day.
Please, don't!
My pretty one.
I'll be back.
My pretty one...
I am a young man...
You scared me.
(Music)
We will survive all this,
by any means necessary.
Where to?
We're here.
Who are you looking for?
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.
So where are they now, our saviors, all the great armies?
In the past, war and dying was a male exclusive thing.
But those times are long gone.
Damned Russians.
Officer, General, Commander, doesn't matter.
I take everyone, as high in rank as possible.
From now on, I will decide who gets me.
No, no.
Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.
You can protect us from over there on the couch, see?
Protect.
Hm?
See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.
Do you understand?
(Russian)
Where is the Major?
Wait.
Hey, Miss.
Who are you looking for?
You, blondie.
Why are you looking so stern?
You!
Could you soap my back, huh?
Who do you want to talk to?
You.
Dismissed.
May I have a seat?
No.
Yesterday our house has been occupied and many women have been raped.
I know nothing of that.
It is your duty to help us.
Who?
My people or yours?
Me.
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.
(Unintelligible)
It's pointless.
You Russian?
Looking what?
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.
Lieutenant, sir.
May I have a word?
Some of the balconies in our house are mined.
Could you help?
Pity.
Miss!
You, I, evening?
Hm?
I Anatol.
You, I, simple as that, huh?
At this moment I made a vow, that nothing and nobody would touch me, no matter what happened.
Come in.
Follow.
That's where I live.
Come on in.
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.
Well...
That's my husband.
Don't you understand?
My husband.
You must understand that.
All humans are bad.
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.
What are doing?
That is mahogany.
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.
To the 215th Rifles!
To victory!
To us.
I Charkov!
He's from Charkov.
Charkov!
Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.
An accountant?
You're kidding me.
I accountant!
You accountant!
We accountant!
Everything fine.
That's life, you see?
You, pretty.
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.
The fucking war is really pissing me off.
True.
When I get back to Charkov,
I'll marry, build a house, get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.
and you, I will take you as my accountant.
Are you a professional soldier?
No...
I, dairy.
Milk!
Milk.
Cow.
- How very interesting.
- Interesting!
Milk and milk.
That's bullshit.
Look at this.
My trophies.
That's nothing.
Here.
THAT is a trophy.
That's not a trophy.
Have a look at this.
That that is a REAL trophy.
An original.
My present to all the ladies.
To kiss and marvel about.
Where toilet?
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.
Would you like something to eat?
You.
(Baby screaming)
You fancy my dick?
Doesn't matter which one.
Dick is dick.
Why Russia?
What were you doing there, you sons of a bitch?
Why Russia?
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.
He is battalion commander.
They don't have commandants, only commanders.
(widow) Did you know that they study German as first foreign language?
Well, it needs a war for us to get this bit of information.
Can I do something for you?
(door slamming)
Hey Mongol.
Have you come all the way from Moscow just to get some water for a German woman?
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?
Made in Germany...
I am taking care of the Major.
Go now.
I'll catch up later.
Go.
Go, Mongol, go!
Move it.
Faster!
Go, go, go!
Move it already.
Faster.
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors and the whole house was rubble.
And it blasted the fattened sow up till under the roof.
Well, obviously it was spoiled.
Here.
Give it to me.
My apologies... for my unsuitable behavior.
Dismissed.
(Music)
Berlin is ours.
There.
I have told everybody that they needed to go.
May I sit down?
Come here.
As you wish.
No?
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.
In every apartment.
We are Russian property now.
At their service.
But us women, we will need to keep our mouths shut, or no man will ever want to touch us again when this is all over.
Poor Germany.
German fighters: sit!
Four.
Four women.
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.
Here.
That's what I've found.
They've got everything.
They've got jewelry and money and houses.
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.
Enough.
What do I care about them?
Sometimes I think that from now on I could endure everything imaginable, as long as it comes from the outside and not from deep within my treacherous heart.
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.
A welcome committee.
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.
Anatol is a gypsy.
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.
My sun.
Do you think...
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?
No.
Never.
Here.
Is that all?
My head is aching like crazy.
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.
If that's the last thing I'll do in my life.
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.
Fuck the Reichstag.
Then he grabs me and throws me on the bed.
And suddenly, he gets so boring, like a lapdog.
Later, he complimented me.
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this."
"You, like this."
He had really bad breath.
(banging)
- Oh.
It's you.
- Good morning.
We bring breakfast.
The next morning, a few blocks away the war was still raging,
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.
The widow, who loved bacon, was busy as a bee.
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard, was all too happy to surrender.
This way.
- Russian horse.
- What's that?
Sugar.
We have sugar!
And bacon and salami and bread and butter.
Great joy, but not for everybody.
Then came the cavalry.
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead, horses snuffling.
When a horse is charging, that's an incredible force.
The whole avalanche is charging against the tank, against the artillery, against all the machine guns -
All kaput.
You've had much more troops, but they just couldn't stand it.
They dropped their weapons and fled.
German soldiers, bah!
Don't be so insensitive.
We didn't start this war!
Sit down.
And stop insulting our host.
Enough.
I Caucasus.
Caucasus, understand?
Big mountain, so beautiful!
Sun, blue sky.
Nice dancing with women.
As sweet as grapes.
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.
Pushkin?
Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.
Go home, understand?
I want to see my children and my wife.
(Singing)
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin."
I want my wife.
My wife.
Understand?
What do you know about fascism?
Fascism?
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a "bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.
To our host.
Right.
To a woman who is quite obviously very bright.
Just like you right now.
Very bright.
But I am not a woman!
To German-Russian friendship!
Hurray!
Everybody upstairs, quick!
Hurry!
Quick!
Search all the apartments.
Out.
Out!
You goddamn bastard!
You dick!
You fucking dick!
Stop it.
Enough!
You know Stalin's orders.
Get lost.
Really?
What if I don't?
Are you gonna shoot me?
I'll kill you if I have to.
He is acting on my orders.
Stop!
A young soldier has stolen food.
He is armed.
Who is living up there?
Who is living there?
Anybody living there?
No.
She's lying.
Lying bitch.
I spit on Germany.
And on Berlin.
We conquered it, and I spit on it!
Get out of my way.
Don't move.
(screaming)
I'll kill you, punk!
Everyone in possession of fire arms or hiding someone with guns will be executed immediately, their houses destroyed.
(footsteps)
They will not forget this.
Can I have something to drink?
(Russian)
(door opening)
You need to get away from here.
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.
(Mongol singing)
During the next few days, the Major was here often.
Great protection for everyone.
In his coat he had tucked away candles and cigars and plenty of gifts that the widow stashed away in her kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.
On the whole, the times were changing.
(Russian)
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?
That is way too much.
The major speaks sophisticated Russian and told me more than I wanted to know.
Now I know about his bank account, his parents and the names of his brothers.
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.
(Russian)
The war continued.
While our men and husbands were sent to Siberia, many of the women found protectors which made them a taboo for the rest of the pack.
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.
Almost there.
Hold it up.
Up.
In and out, in and out.
It's like Grand Central Station in here.
Mussolini is dead.
Hanged.
He deserved it.
One asshole less.
Cheers!
As soon as Andrej had left the house, Anatol claimed his visiting rights.
I was afraid that the two top dogs would meet and kill me one day.
It's not that I could claim that this Major is raping me.
I am at his service.
A whore?
Maybe.
(snoring)
I have met that kind of woman only once in my life.
People told me not to talk to her because she was unsound.
Whatever that means: unsound.
Young woman!
No way.
Incredible.
There she comes prancing along as if nothing happened.
- How often?
- Four times.
You?
Come on.
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.
So do you.
Here.
Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux.
Take it.
You take that with you.
Seems you are having a good life here.
That's one way to put it.
Come on.
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.
The Major is guarding us well so that we can drink his tea without any disturbances.
That feels so good.
Where to?
What do you care?
You can't go in there.
Who's in there?
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.
So I tell him:"Young man,
"that gun there over your shoulder, that might go off."
And when I go up the stairs, on the second floor someone rushes out of the apartment, grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"
And I am in shock and I say:
- "No, surely not."
- How dumb of you.
How's your husband?
He was there when it happened the first time.
He's been a bit confused ever since.
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.
They are pretty unimaginative.
It may be that at home, they have the latest and greatest socialist planned economy, ...but their sex life is that of Adam and Eve.
That's what I told my husband, too.
With all the food shortage, a good husband isn't worth that much.
I guess a satisfactory sex life depends on regular meals.
For me, it's all about a full stomach.
No gifts, no sex!
Heart, Pain, Love, Sex Drive.
To us!
Who knows when we'll be together again.
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!
That is apple streusel cake.
Yeah, with crumbles, and it's still steaming hot.
(Singing) # You, you are in my heart. #
# You, you are on my mind. #
# You, you cause me great pains, # # you don't know how much I love you. #
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
# don't know how much I love you. #
Not too much going on with our Russian men right now, am I right?
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.
Have you heard anything from Gerd?
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.
Oh my God.
How do you know you've got it?
(Book seller) Itching and burning.
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.
I've read it in a lexicon.
A lexicon...
Here.
An American gave that to me.
Chew it.
Good, isn't it?
Americans...
They all look like film stars.
I'm leaving.
And tell her... that I'll be back.
You got that?
What's that?
Can you protect us?
Just this one day?
I'll be here.
Where will you go...
later?
To where I am needed.
A special evening with the Major.
Good conversation.
He told me that he adores me.
And that he doesn't care about anything else.
Other than the Germans, the Russian men really appreciate educated women.
But the war hasn't ended yet.
Excuse me.
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.
Come on, kiddos, let's get out of here.
We will finish building this tower of yours.
That's him.
Good day.
You Russian?
Translate.
The German army came to my village
and killed all the children.
They have stabbed them to death,
took their bodies at the ankles...
Continue!
...and smashed their skulls on the walls of the houses.
Have you heard that?
Or did you see it with your own eyes?
I saw it.
Hey!
Why so fast?
Have you forgotten your panties?
(Russian)
(woman) You speak Russian, so tell him he needs to stop that.
You speak Russian, right?
Move it, you slut!
Go.
(Music)
(Russian)
Where are you going?
I've been waiting for you.
What's wrong with you?
Comrade Major!
The old Germany is coming to an end.
Stay away from him!
He is coming to me, not the other way round.
Go away.
Why?
You Germans have hanged his wife.
(Music)
(Announcement) Attention!
On April 30th, 1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.
He deserted all of us who have pledged allegiance to him.
Following the orders of the Fuhrer, you still believe it's your duty to defend Berlin although the supply of heavy armory, ammunition and your position make this fight utterly pointless.
With every hour you continue to fight, you prolong the horrible suffering of the civil population of Berlin... and our wounded soldiers.
From now on, everybody who dies in the battle for Berlin will have sacrificed their lives in vain.
In accordance with the leaders of the Soviet army I prompt you to cease all fighting immediately.
Breitling, Artillery General and commanding officer of the Berlin defense.
Fellow soldiers and officers of the 8th guard army.
This morning, the Berlin garrison has capitulated.
Berlin... is defeated.
I've told you we would make it!
(Russian national anthem)
(Undiscernible)
(Soldiers singing the Russian national anthem)
I'll join my fellow Germans.
Go to Siberia?
What about us?
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!
Talk to me.
I've been waiting for you.
I have prayed and hoped, prayed and hoped.
No I want you to fulfill some of those hopes for me.
(cheering)
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!
Berlin is defeated!
To our home country!
Long live the Red Army!
Long live Stalin!
(Lieutenant) Hold on, wait a second.
What have we here?
Two halibuts.
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.
That's great!
Let's drink.
(piano music)
Capitulation.
The time has come.
The war is over.
Us women have been looking forward to this day so much.
So how does it feel?
Bitter, bitter defeat.
More and more people report gruesome things.
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp something in the air, mean and threatening.
I don't want to think about that right now.
(Russian)
It's over.
I don't know...
I'm afraid misfortune has still some tricks up its sleeves.
(Russian)
Do you hear that?
They drink and smoke like men.
There are 1 million women in the Russian army.
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.
Once a woman came to me, Ljuba was her name I think.
She says: "Comrade Major, I believe I will fall today.
"I want new clothes." I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.
"Bullets just avoid you." Two hours later, she comes again.
And again.
Then I tell her:
"Then the new shirt, with ties white as snow, it would be spoiled by the blood."
All female soldiers fear that when they die, they don't look pretty.
Are you a fascist?
What are you looking for?
All occupied.
And the battalion commander?
That's what I like about you Mongols.
Not a single unnecessary word.
1678 days... since I've been in this war.
And now...
And she... she's a whore.
Am I right?
This whole place... is a brothel!
(door opening)
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.
A pistol, huh?
Bastard!
Peace, huh?
Don't!
War kaput!
I said, move it!
Everybody downstairs.
Hurry!
All of you, downstairs.
Hurry!
Faster.
Quick!
Don't move.
Where you get weapons?
Whose apartment is that?
Who?
It's mine.
Is that hers?
It's hers.
That is crime against decree of Red Army.
Long live the Fuhrer.
Eliminate her.
You can all go to hell.
Did you know about weapons?
- No.
- Go back to apartment.
Shoot them all!
Go now.
Stop.
They're liars, all of them!
Shoot them.
Leave this woman.
She is a Hitler broad.
Do you understand?
No.
First she will be interrogated.
Do you understand?
What are you doing, brother?
This woman has sheltered an armed soldier.
The punishment for that is death.
Go, now!
I'll have to report this.
Burn them alive!
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.
(Russian)
Traitor!
I own whole Berlin!
Hotel Adlon, Wedding, Kaiserdamm!
Red flags everywhere.
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.
What is it?
Quarrel?
What are you looking at?
Get out of my sight.
Hey, what's up?
To victory, Commander.
To Stalin and our victory.
Wait.
You should stay with your people.
The war is over.
Here!
I get it.
Look...
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.
They love me, all of them.
Everything all right?
Do you want something to eat?
Here.
What's better?
You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?
And you, get out of here... before I shoot your nuts off!
You, listen!
We celebrate.
Everybody come, whole house.
Order!
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.
Not human.
Turd!
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!
(Andrey) Everyone, come now.
Order!
Fill the glasses.
What are you standing there?
We've got guests.
Why fear?
(Music)
Look down there.
What do you see?
Soldiers.
Russians!
Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.
And you're right.
None of us is hesitating a single second if we can shoot a German.
Your blood is on our uniforms.
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!
Most of them didn't even know what that is, Germany.
Now come with me.
What is happening here?
Careful, that's mahogany.
Let me go!
(Russian)
- You dance.
Dance!
- How dare you?
This is my living room and not a dance hall.
You understand?
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.
You.
Sing?
Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.
No.
What does that mean, "no"?
That is Europe!
That is Europe!
Drink, drink.
Why not?
I'm looking at you.
And you?
Nothing.
Well, maybe next time.
To you.
I Anatol.
- I know.
- Bärbel.
My heart calls Bärbel.
Bärbel, Bärbel, Bärbel.
(Music)
I play the fiddle.
Violin.
Violin?
You play the piano?
In an orchestra, but not any more.
The violin is lost.
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.
Why don't you go upstairs?
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.
We all need that.
Do you come with me?
Later.
- Sure?
- Yes.
It's good that you are here.
(undiscernible)
I want to embrace you my whole life.
I am here, you're in Moscow.
Nobody has arms that long.
Try it.
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.
"The war is over." He looked at me for a long while.
"Every newborn child cries for war," he said.
Nothing and nobody, no man, no nation, will stop this vicious circle.
Only death.
Not so fast, I am getting sick.
Gee.
Attention.
And now for everybody...
"I in love with you."
Bärbel.
(Music)
(humming)
Dance.
Come on, let's go.
We are not a people any more, we're only "the population".
I am talking about individuals that form within a democracy.
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.
Dance, dance, you come.
I think we should look at the greater picture here.
The countries of Europe will burst their borders.
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will, just like Napoleon did, re-order the political world map.
So we will become a Soviet republic with planned economy, huh?
Thanks.
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.
Let's start the every day life again, and we will soon get into the groove.
Slow down.
Drink.
The Soviet Union is just at the beginning of its evolution.
The future will prove that.
You love your country.
Just as I love mine.
My mother once said that one day,
I would marry a man who played the piano.
Everybody has been wondering what this day would be like.
I haven't.
Never.
I didn't want to experience it.
Why not?
If you don't do it, Andrej, I will tell you something.
War is changing the words.
"Love" is not what it used to be.
And yet,
in spite of that,
I want that my husband finds the same wife that he left behind when he returns.
Please stay.
(Music)
Us women, we are branded for life.
But for here and now, right in this moment,
I feel fantastic.
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.
(door opening)
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.
And mummy?
Ilse?
Ilse?
Ilse?
(Ilse crying)
Ilse.
Ilse, get away from him.
(Screaming)
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.
We went to see Felix.
You could smell the tree resin.
We came across a cloud of butterflies.
And you knew all their names.
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds, Swallowtails and many more.
One was taking a sunbath right there on the path, it was velvety brown and yellow with a blue hem.
You called it a Mourning Cloak.
(Music)
So many things I've been given in my life.
In abundance.
The Major had lost everything.
Damn Russian idealist.
He takes it all like he wants the world to be.
Soviet apostle.
I like him though.
The less he wants from me, the more I like him.
Very much.
Andrej.
Andrej.
Andrej isn't here any more.
Relocated.
To where?
Unknown.
Good-bye.
"The birds so quiet, the bells are silent."
(from "18 Little Songs of the Bitter Homeland" by Yiannis Ritsos)
Isn't that how it goes?
Please, sit down.
The studio, is that gone?
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.
Ukrainians like that.
Here, that's for you.
You are shameless.
Don't you see that?
It is disgusting just to look at you.
(Music)
(Music)
Atten-shun!
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?
That I had the chance to get to know you.
Take care of yourself.
How are we supposed to live?
Eyes front!
"Relocation," that's what they call it.
With full honors and merits.
To Siberia, who knows?
Gerd.
My beloved Gerd.
What shall we do?
Turn back the wheel of time?
Back to your very first words?
"30 minutes", you said.
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will never want to leave me again."
(Music)
(Music)
What?
What?
No answer.
Two days later he was gone.
I don't know if he will come back.
I am surprised that I am not suffering more.
Maybe I am just too busy.
I need to find a piece of flint stone,
I need to mop up the floor of the apartment and I am desperately looking for some flowers.
Yesterday I found some lilac.
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.
Who knows?
Maybe our hearts have a say in this, too, and we'll see each other again, some day.
(Music)
When the diary "A woman in Berlin" was first released in Germany in 1959, it was a huge scandal.
Many people said that it was a disgrace and an insult to the German women.
The author was so shocked by the rejection and the contempt that her book received.
She prohibited any further releases for as long as she lived.
And even beyond her death, here real name was never to be revealed.

The unthinkable had occurred.
It was on April 26, 1945.
The Russian army had encircled Berlin and was advancing on the Reichstag, street by street.
You could see the sun behind the clouds that day and the scent of lilacs wafted over from abandoned gardens.
Where do I start?
What are the right words?
As a journalist I had travelled to 12 countries.
I lived in Moscow, Paris and London.
I enjoyed living in Paris and London.
But I came back.
I wanted to be part of it.
My name doesn't matter.
I was just one of many who believed in my country's destiny.
Doubts were for weaklings.
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
A never-ending triumph.
Russia lacks leadership.
By the time they recover, we'll be in Moscow.
Sorry for barging in, but we happen to be at war.
The day Gerd left, his boots echoed through the house.
We were convinced we were right.
We all breathed the same air and it was intoxicating.
He helped me out of my coat...
The Russians have no idea what's going to hit them.
We were off to the Sorbonne, chattering away in French.
And he thought I was one of those big, blonde Swedes.
I skipped to get in step with him.
Then he stopped and said,
"Ah, une fille du Fuhrer."
And that was the end of that.
A shame.
One thing!
Without music...
I'd like us... to take a moment to think of our men who are scattered across Europe
and, in doing so, include them in this evening.
Run!
Get out of here!
Go!
Come here!
Get in there!
Hurry!
No uniforms and no weapons, or they'll shoot us.
Felix, where are you?
Anyone see my son?
No news.
No orders.
Nothing!
Nobody gives a damn about us.
Lenchen?
!
Where are you?
In some parts of town they're even welcoming them.
Russki swine!
They had been booksellers.
They sometimes spoke French.
And that's the pharmacist's widow.
Her husband once cured Hindenburg of a headache.
That's all over.
Now we step on the corpses of dead women just to get at a jar of jam.
That is Frau Binder, a musician.
Her husband is missing.
Can someone help me?
She can't breathe!
She...
Look at me!
I'll write it all down,
Gerd, for you to read.
Like some?
Thanks.
She's from Silesia.
Too much to take.
Hurry!
Get under there!
- Mami?
- Don't be afraid.
I'm here.
Halt!
Residents of Berlin!
Residents of this street!
All weapons must be handed over at once!
This is your last chance.
Surrender your weapons!
This is your last chance.
Go ahead!
There!
Move!
Go to the top!
Move back!
Careful!
This way!
Hurry!
Careful!
Comrade Colonel!
The men have almost reached the station.
The order was to proceed to the Reichstag.
Yes, sir, comrade Colonel!
No Reichstag?
Why not?
It's so close!
We're going on, damnit!
That's an order!
Secure the flanks!
You hear me?
What... what do you want?
Speak Russian?
Russian.
Come!
Eat.
War kaput.
Woman... come!
Eat.
War kaput, woman.
No afraid.
No afraid.
We won't let them bury us here.
Woman, come!
No afraid!
Come, come!
No afraid!
- Come!
- Pretty girls!
Come here!
Be nice and you'll get something to eat!
Potatoes.
Very good.
May I?
Who knows how this works?
Hey, Ukrainian, do you know?
So here are our Soviet liberators!
Overjoyed.
Obviously amazed at themselves for getting this far.
I know them, their sandals, villages and shabby new buildings they're so proud of.
They won't strain themselves.
Hey!
Urine!
Try some urine!
- That's enough!
- No, seriously...
Your urine is too old.
I used urine to get my general in Leningrad back on his feet...
Come on!
It's true!
Just what are they doing there?
Please!
Husband?
Husband and two children.
Come!
Now!
Let me through!
No!
- You don't belong here!
- Let me go!
I didn't do a thing!
Most of my countrymen are now very clever when it comes to saving their own skins.
- You're endangering all of us!
- The Silesian girl was an easy victim.
Go on!
Here, hurry.
The attic apartment on the right.
Hurry!
Go on!
Take it and go!
Go on!
Say something!
You speak Russian!
You can't let them do this!
Pretty woman!
Soldier!
Why do you take a woman who has no desire?
Willing women are dirty.
Open up!
Not here.
- Where?
- We're almost there.
Stop!
Come back!
Commander...
- I'm looking for a commander.
- What's wrong?
Are you the commander?
I...
We need help.
Are you the commander?
Lots of commanders.
We're all commanders.
Which one do you want?
Major...
We need your help.
All our men are healthy.
Frau Hitler!
Our country is in ruins.
Gerd, remember your first words?
You said, "Thirty minutes."
"Give me thirty minutes, and you'll never leave me."
God help us!
The back hallway.
The widow offered me a place to stay.
She led the way... to an apartment that was surprisingly intact.
I accepted.
And here...
You can stay here for the time being.
The move was easy.
A few steps up to my studio.
A blouse, a few books and some notes.
- You can stay if you like.
- Thanks.
I'd like that.
Take care.
I should have looked around a little.
But we never see everything.
And the story took its course.
This was a nice place.
How did you find me?
I searched every cellar.
How often?
Often.
The riverbanks are dressed in green.
The trees breathe lightly, deeply.
We go on fighting courageously.
In the last battle of this war.
It was a long way to this May.
It cost a lot of strength and courage.
But now we're free again.
And we proudly stand guard!
Hello, May!
Our soldiers and ?
S weapons...
They'd be gone!
Yes.
Yesterday at the pump, it was my turn, and somebody came up with two Iron Crosses and one German Cross in gold.
And he took my bucket gallantly.
I said, "What an honour.
I'm not used to this." He said,
"You have to be strong, ma'am."
"Because if the Russians do just a fraction of what we did to them during the last four years..."
and he said then presently no German would be left alive.
"Presently"?
Nobody says that any more.
I have a question.
How do I say:
Excuse me, do you have a dictionary?
He doesn't need one for what he wants.
Lenchen!
Come with us!
Go with them?
Where to?
Our house was stormed for the next few days.
Day and night.
One woman hung herself.
Another was shot and killed.
Nobody was spared.
Every feeling is dead.
Lenchen!
- What's that?
- A map.
Where are you going?
Come over here!
Over there!
"Stand up, wretched of the earth who are forced to starve."
"Reason thunders in its volcano.
This is the eruption of the end."
Go away!
I...
I love you!
Hello.
Please don't!
My lovely!
I come back.
My lovely.
I'm a young man.
You startled me.
We'll survive.
At all costs.
Where to?
We're here!
Where are they now?
Our rescuers?
The great armies?
War and dying used to be men's business.
That's all over.
Damn Russians!
Officer, General, Commander.
I go for the highest rank.
Starting now, I decide who gets me.
No, no, no.
Out of there!
It's still my bed!
You can protect us on the couch.
Look it up: "protect".
Like this.
You don't have to sleep in my bed.
Did you understand me?
- Where's the major?
- Wait.
Fraulein!
Who are you looking for?
Hey, blondie!
Why so glum?
How about scrubbing my back with soap?
Who would you like to talk to?
You.
Dismissed!
May I sit down?
No!
Our building was stormed yesterday and many women raped.
I know nothing of it.
It is your duty to help.
Help who?
My people or yours?
Me.
What do those few minutes matter?
It's pointless.
You speak Russian?
What you look for?
Look for officer?
Officer?
All with their women.
But I am here.
Lieutenant, may I speak to you?
Several balconies in our house are booby-trapped.
Can you help us?
Too bad.
Fraulein!
You and me, tonight?
Me Anatol.
You and me...
It's that simple.
It was then I swore that nobody would touch me, unless I let them.
No matter what.
Come in!
Follow us!
Time to go to your friends.
Hey!
That is my husband!
Don't you understand?
My husband!
You must understand.
All people are bad.
I don't understand him.
He won't leave.
What are you doing?
This is mahogany!
Calm down!
Go to the kitchen!
Me Charkov!
He comes from Charkov.
Me industrial clerk.
Accountant.
No!
Me accountant!
You accountant!
We accountant!
Everything good!
That is life.
Understand?
You, lovely!
These Russians are great.
So full of life!
It's about time all this shit was over.
Right.
When I get back to Charkov,
I'll get married and build a house, have kids, work on a kolkhoz and he'll be my accountant.
- Are you a professional soldier?
- No.
Me... dairy!
- Milk!
- Dairy?
Cow!
- That's interesting.
- No interesting!
Milk and milk...
All shit!
Look at this!
My trophies!
That's nothing!
Here!
- This is a trophy!
- That's no trophy!
Here!
Look at this!
This is a real trophy.
My present to the ladies!
For them to kiss!
Where toilet?
- Toilet in hallway.
- Thank you.
Like something else to eat?
You.
Want my cock?
Does not matter who!
Cock is cock!
Why Russia?
Why?
What's wrong with you people?
Why Russia?
This is Major...
I'm afraid I've forgotten his name.
He's the battalion commander.
They don't have a commandant.
Did you know
German is the first foreign language they learn?
It takes a war for us to discover that.
Can I do anything for you?
Hey, Mongolian!
Did you come here from Moscow to get water for a German?
Or is our major bathing in essence of roses?
A German product.
I'm responsible for the major.
Go on.
I'll be there shortly.
Go on!
Get moving, Mongolian!
Get moving!
Go!
Run, Mongolian!
Then a bomb landed in the neighbour's yard and turned the whole house into kindling.
And their pig was blown to pieces!
And no longer edible.
Here!
Let go, Masha!
Please excuse
- my behaviour.
- Dismissed.
Berlin is ours!
Here!
I told them all to leave.
May I sit down?
Come over here.
As you wish.
No?
The raping continues.
They are everywhere, in every home.
We are Russians now.
At their service.
And we women will have to keep silent.
Or no man will ever want to touch us again.
Poor Germany.
Take me with you.
Nineteen soldiers.
Four!
Four women!
Berlin is one big whorehouse!
Look at this!
They have everything!
They have jewels!
Money!
Houses!
And they make war!
Bastards!
Enough!
What do I think about them?
Sometimes I feel I could put up with anything.
As long as it comes from without and doesn't ambush me from within my heart.
I'm doing fine.
And my Russian is getting better.
- Was someone here?
- No.
What a greeting!
Madame, I've brought you a suitor.
Anatol is a Gypsy.
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protector.
My sunshine.
Do you think think the Fuhrer will abandon us?
No.
Never.
Here.
Is that all?
My head aches.
Where are you going?
To get you something to eat, if it's the last thing I do.
Why the Reichstag?
Fuck him!
And fuck the Reichstag!
Then he grabbed me and threw me on the bed, and suddenly he became very boring
like a little puppy.
And afterwards he made me a compliment.
He said,
"Ukrainians like this."
"And you like this."
But... he had such bad breath.
- Oh, it's you!
- Good morning.
We're bringing you breakfast.
The next morning, a few blocks away the war was raging, the major came with all his men.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
The widow who could be had for a scrap of bacon buzzed around like a bee.
And Herr Eckart, our Volkssturm man, was ready to surrender.
This way!
Russian horse.
What's this?
Sugar!
We have sugar!
And bacon and salami...
What a delight!
But not for everyone.
Then came the cavalry, coats flying, swords raised, horses panting.
When a horse charges, it has incredible strength.
And the whole avalanche charged the tanks, the artillery, the machine guns.
Destroyed them all!
Your soldiers outnumbered us, but they dropped their guns and ran away.
German soldiers.
- Soldiers, officers, everyone!
Afraid!
- Don't be so rude.
- We didn't start the war.
- Sit down!
- And stop insulting our hosts.
- Enough!
Me the Caucasus Mountains.
Understand?
Caucasus Mountains big, so beautiful.
Sun, mountains, blue sky!
Beautiful dances and women!
As sweet as grapes.
And Pushkin was there in exile.
I don't care about Pushkin.
I want to go home.
Home, understand?
To my wife and kids.
You see?
And you say Pushkin?
I want my wife.
My wife.
Understand?
What do you know about fascism?
Fascism?
It comes from fascio.
It means "bundle of reeds".
Very old.
Roman.
To our hostess!
- Right!
- A woman who is obviously smart!
Just like you!
Very smart!
I'm no woman!
To German-
Russian friendship!
Hurrah!
Search every apartment!
Out!
You bastard!
You scum!
Stop!
Enough!
You know Stalin's decree!
Just stop!
What if I don't?
Will you shoot me?
If I have to, I'll shoot you.
He's acting on my orders.
Halt!
A young German stole some food.
He's armed.
Who lives up there?
Who lives there?
Does anyone live there?
No.
You're lying!
You're a lying bitch!
I spit on Germany and Berlin!
We defeated them!
I spit on them!
Out of my way!
Halt!
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Everyone in possession of a weapon or who hides someone in possession of a weapon will be shot at once!
And the house will be razed!
They'll never forgive you!
Can I have something to drink?
You have to leave.
What are you doing here?
I'm not going to Siberia.
I'm not going.
The next few days the major came and went.
It meant protection for everyone.
He brought candles, cigars and lots of presents which the widow quickly stowed away in her cupboard.
In a way, a new era was beginning.
A lot of Russian men like to play Santa Claus.
Why should we women stop them?
That's way too much!
The major speaks eloquent Russian and he told me more than I wanted to know.
I know his bank account, his parents' and his brothers' names.
You're our guest today.
Now sit down.
You are so old-fashioned.
I love to touch him.
Let's go!
The war raged on.
While our men were being sent to Siberia, many women sought protectors and became taboo for the rest.
Careful!
It's a Singer.
Not much further.
Hold it up!
In and out, in and out!
It's like a train station in here.
Mussolini is dead!
They hung him upside down!
Andrei had scarcely left when Anatol showed up.
I was scared to death the two alpha males would meet with me in the middle.
I can't really say the major rapes me.
I am at his disposal.
A whore?
Perhaps.
I only met a whore once in my life.
People said not to talk to her, that she was bad.
What does that mean anyway?
Bad.
Young lady!
No!
Well, well...
Along she comes as if everything were fine.
How often?
Four times.
You?
Come on!
- I never thought I'd see you again!
- You look good!
You do!
Here, quince jam.
A real Bordeaux!
Take it!
How classy!
You're spoiled!
That's one way of putting it.
I'm so happy you're here.
Elke's visit cheered us all up.
The major's guards protect us as we drink his tea in peace.
It does us the world of good.
- Where are you going?
- What's it to you?
- You can't go in.
- Who's there?
So I said, "Young man, that rifle on your shoulder could accidentally go off."
And me?
I was going upstairs, and somebody on the 2nd floor fired a shot from inside and grabbed me by the hair and said, "You syphilis."
I was terrified and said,
"No, not me!"
What an idiot.
How's your husband?
He was with me the first time and is still a bit disturbed.
- What do you think of our cavaliers?
- Not impressed.
They have no imagination.
At home they may have the latest planned economy, but when it comes to eroticism, they're like Adam and Eve.
- That's what I told my husband.
- With our scanty rations, your good old husband isn't worth much either.
Well...
I guess for a good love life you need regular meals.
My focal point is my belly.
No food, no fun.
Romance, pain, love, lust...
- To us!
- Cheers!
Who knows when we'll meet again!
Careful!
It's hot!
- Apple pie!
- Yes, with crumble.
It's singing to me.
You, you, you're in my heart
You, you, you're on my mind
You, you cause me such pain
- You don't know just how good I am
- Oh, yes...
You don't know just how good I am
Our men aren't what they used to be, either.
They're so weak it's hard just to look at them.
The weaker sex.
Have you heard from Gerd?
I have a question about syphilis.
Oh, God!
How do you notice it?
Itching, stinging.
And little boils.
They show up later.
I read it in an encyclopedia.
An encyclopedia!
Here, an American gave me this.
Chew it!
Cool, huh?
Americans...
They all look like actors.
Handsome, like from the movies.
I'm going.
Tell her
I'll be back!
Hear me?
What is it?
A mission.
Can we count on you?
When the day comes.
I'll be here.
Where will you go...
later?
Where I'm needed.
A special evening with the major.
A good conversation.
He said I was marvellous.
Nothing else mattered to him.
Contrary to German men, Russian men appreciated educated women.
But... the war wasn't over yet.
Excuse me.
Do you have a moment?
We...
We need your help.
Come on, kids.
Leave the room.
We'll finish building your tower.
It's him.
Hello.
You Russian?
Translate!
In my village, German soldiers killed all the children.
They took them stabbed them.
They grabbed them by the feet...
Go on!
...threw them against the walls and smashed their skulls.
Hearsay?
Or did you see it?
I saw it.
Hey, what's the hurry?
Did you forget your underwear?
You speak Russian!
Tell him I have a family!
Tell him to leave me alone!
You speak Russian!
Help!
Where are you going?
I was waiting for you.
What's wrong?
Comrade Major.
Old Germany is finished.
Keep your hands off him!
He comes to me.
I don't go to him.
Go away!
Why?
You people hung his wife.
Residents of Berlin!
On 30 April, 1945 the Fuhrer killed himself, and betrayed all those who
swore allegiance to him.
The Fuhrer's orders were for you to defend Berlin.
But the lack of heavy artillery and ammunition and the entire situation make any further fighting meaningless.
Every hour you go on fighting prolongs the dreadful suffering of Berlin's civilian population and of our wounded.
All those who now die in the battle for Berlin are sacrificing themselves for nothing.
In agreement with the Supreme Command of the Soviet Army, I order you to immediately cease all combat operations.
Weidling,
General of the Artillery and Commander of the Defence Area of Berlin.
Comrade soldiers and officers of the 8th Red Army, this morning, the Berlin Garrison surrendered!
Berlin is defeated.
I'm going back to my people.
To Siberia?
What about us?
Talk to me, Friedrich!
Please!
Talk to me!
I waited for you!
I prayed.
And I hoped.
I prayed and hoped.
And now I want you to at least try
to stand by me.
To victory!
Berlin is defeated!
To the homeland!
Long live the Red Army!
Long live Stalin!
Just a moment!
What do we have here?
Two halibuts!
- Unbelievable!
- Hitler,
Goebbels... kaput!
Great!
Let's drink!
Capitulation.
At long last.
The war is over!
How we women longed for that.
But now?
A very bitter defeat.
More and more people are talking about horrific things.
I sense an eerie something in the air.
Evil and menacing.
I don't want to think about it now.
It's all over.
I don't know.
I fear that misfortune has a greater imagination.
Listen.
They are drinking and smoking like men.
The Russian Army has one million women.
They come from everywhere.
We have no uniforms.
The boots are too large.
Shirts and jackets... a disaster.
One of the girls came to me.
I think her name was Luba.
She said,
"Major, I believe I will be killed today."
"I want fresh clothes." I said, "No!"
"You've been with us for a long time.
The bullets avoid you."
She came back two hours later.
And again and again.
So I said, "Yes."
She got a new shirt with ribbons here.
As white as snow.
It was full of blood.
Every female soldier is afraid of not being pretty when they die.
Are you a Fascist?
Where are you going?
They're all taken!
The battalion commander?
That's what I like about you Mongolians.
Not a word too many.
1,678 days
I've been at war.
And now...
And she...
She's a whore, right?
The whole place is a whorehouse.
You come with me!
A gun, huh?
Peace, huh?
War kaput!
Get there, I said!
Everybody downstairs!
Hurry!
Everybody downstairs!
Let's go!
Halt!
Where's the gun from?
Whose apartment is it?
Whose?
Mine.
Is this hers?
It's hers.
This is a violation of Red Army regulations!
Long live the Fuhrer!
Liquidate her!
I hope you all die!
Did you know about the gun?
No.
Go back to your apartments.
- Shoot them all!
- Go on!
- Halt!
- They're all liars!
Shoot them!
Forget the woman!
- She's a Nazi!
- Did you understand me?
No.
You will be questioned first.
- Did you understand me?
- What are you doing?
She hid an armed soldier!
That's grounds for execution!
Go!
I'll have to report this.
Torch them!
How could you risk that?
You jeopardised us all!
Got the Nazi monster in its own burrow.
The garrison of the German capital has capitulated.
Traitor!
Me go all Berlin!
Hotel Adlon, Wedding, Kaiserdamm!
Everywhere red flags!
Red flags!
Nice flags, good quality.
What's wrong?
Fighting?
Stop staring!
Go on!
What's wrong?
To our victory, Commander!
To Stalin!
To Stalin!
Wait!
Stay with your people!
The war is over!
Here!
I've got them.
Just you look.
Ljuba, Marina, Olga, Thekla.
And they all love me.
All of them.
Everything good?
Want something to eat?
Here!
What's better?
Tell me!
His prick or my bike?
Get out before I shoot your balls off!
We're celebrating.
Everybody, come!
The whole house!
It's an order!
Your Hitler is no human!
He is stinking filth.
No human!
Filth!
Lenchen, they're yelling upstairs!
Everybody!
Come up!
It's an order!
Fill it up.
Why are you standing around?
We have guests.
Why afraid?
Look down there.
You see...?
Soldiers.
Russians!
Beasts!
Or animals, as you say.
That's right.
Not one of us would hesitate a second to shoot a German.
Your blood is on our uniforms, and that's good.
None of them wanted to go to war.
Most of them didn't even know what it was...
Germany.
And now come with me.
What is going on here?
Careful!
It's mahogany!
Let me go!
- You dance!
- Are you crazy?
This is my living room and not a dance hall.
- You understand?
- Fantastic!
Not a dance hall!
Drink schnapps.
Vodka, schnapps good.
You...
Sing?
He wants me to sing.
I'm not going to sing.
- What does he want?
- What do you think?
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?
No, no, no...
This is Europe!
Europe!
Why not?
I look at you.
And you?
Nothing!
Next time!
To you!
Me Anatol.
- I know.
- Barbel.
My heart calls out:
Barbel...
I play the violin.
The violin.
- Fiddle.
- You play the piano?
In an orchestra, but not any more.
My violin is gone.
That's good.
I want to play the piano, too.
Why don't you go upstairs?
Should I?
Why not?
We all should.
- Will you come, too?
- Later.
- Really?
- Sure.
It's good to have you here.
I want to embrace you.
For the rest of my life.
Me here, you in Moscow.
Nobody has arms that long.
Try!
The major asked me to call him Andrei.
"Why not," I said. "The war is over."
He gazed at me for a long time.
"Every newborn child yells for war,"
he said.
And that nothing, no person or nation, could stop that cycle.
Except death.
Not fast enough!
Faster!
Everybody!
Listen!
And now the song...
I Am So In Love With You.
Dance!
Come on!
We're no longer a people.
We're a population.
I mean individuals who come together in a democracy and work hard for prosperity.
Dance!
We shouldn't see it within a small framework.
European countries will overcome their borders and grow together.
Like Napoleon, the victorious powers will get rid of countries and nations.
And we'll become a Soviet republic with planned economy nonsense!
Thank you. I...
Herr Hoch, feeling better?
We have to be practical.
Things will get better.
Not so fast!
Drink!
Drink!
The Soviet Union has just started to develop.
The future will tell.
You love your country.
Just as I love mine.
My mother once said
I would marry a man who plays the piano.
Everyone always wondered what this day would be like.
Not me.
Never.
I didn't want to experience it.
Why not?
If you don't tell me, then I'll tell you, Andrei.
War changes our words.
Love is no longer what it once was.
And still...
I still want... my husband to find the woman... he left behind.
Don't go!
We women have been branded for life.
But for the time being, at this very moment,
I feel just fine.
I'll get us tea.
Ilse has some.
Morning, Lenchen.
Is anybody up yet?
Where's Vanya?
At work.
And Mama?
Ilse, come on, get up!
Gerd, do you remember?
It was a Tuesday.
Let's go and see Felix.
We could smell the pine resin.
Want to?
We were engulfed in a cloud of butterflies.
And you knew each one by name.
Common blue, Brimstone,
Firebird, Swallowtail and so many more.
One was sunning itself on the path, velvet brown, yellow and blue trim.
You said it was a Mourning Cloak.
I've had so many things in my life, an over-abundance.
The major lost everything.
Damn Russian idealist!
He sees himself the way he wants the world to be.
A Soviet true believer!
But I like him.
The less he wants from me, the more I like him.
Very much.
Andrei?
Andrei is no longer here.
Transferred.
Where to?
Who knows?
Goodbye.
"The birds are silent.
The bells are hushed."
Isn't that how it goes?
Sit down.
The studio?
Is it gone?
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.
Ukrainians like this...
Here, for you.
You're all shameless.
Don't you realise that?
It's disgusting just to look at you!
Attention!
I want to thank you.
What for?
Being allowed to know you.
Take care of yourself.
How do we go on living?
Attention!
Transferred!
That's what they call it.
An honourable transfer.
To Siberia.
Who knows?
Gerd, my beloved Gerd.
What do we do now?
Turn back the hands of time?
Back to the first words you said.
You said, "30 minutes."
"Just give me 30 minutes and you'll never leave me."
What?
No answer.
Two days later he was gone.
I don't know if he'll be back.
I'm surprised it doesn't hurt any more.
But I have so much to do.
I have to find a flint stone.
Mop up the puddles in the studio and scavenge for greens.
I found some lilacs yesterday.
Does Gerd ever think of me?
Who knows?
Maybe his heart will speak again and I'll see him...
Sometime.
WHEN THE DIARY "ANONYMA:
THE DOWNFALL OF BERLIN"
WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN GERMANY IN 1959,
IT WAS INDIGNANTLY REJECTED, IT WAS A DISGRACE TO GERMAN WOMEN.
SHOCKED BY THE CONTEMPT OF HER CONTEMPORARIES,
THE AUTHOR FORBID FURTHER PUBLISHING OF HER BOOK UNTIL HER DEATH.
AND EVEN AFTER SHE WAS GONE, HER NAME WAS TO BE KEPT SECRET.
Anonyma
A Woman in Berlin
Who would've thought that?
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin and now they were heading towards the Reichstag.
On this day, you could see the sun behind the clouds, and the smell of lilac wafted through all the smoke.
How to start?
How to find the right words?
I've been a journalist, I've traveled 12 countries.
Been living in Moscow, Paris and London.
I really liked to stay in Paris and London.
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.
My name doesn't matter.
I am one of the many who fervently believed in our country's future.
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.
The Russians don't have a leader.
When they finally come to their senses, we are already knocking at their front door in Moscow.
Pardon our pushiness, but it's war after all.
Gerd hated railway stations.
When he left, the sound of his boots filled the house.
We were certain to do the right thing, we breathed the same air as everybody else.
We were part of this.
And then he takes off my coat and says:
The Russians have no idea what's coming towards them.
So we were heading towards the Sorbonne and chatting away in French.
He thought that I was one of those tall blond Swedes.
Then I made a double step to match my stride to his.
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.
Hold on.
I...
I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.
I would like for us all to share this moment, this wonderful evening, with our husbands who are stationed somewhere all over Europe.
Get lost!
Run, run!
Get away!
Go away!
Houses on the right.
Fan out.
Come here, damn it!
Mummy, where are you?
Come on.
Hurry.
Away.
Go away.
Open fire, reload grenade.
...and fire!
Fire!
Shit.
- Wait for me.
- Watch out!
Heads down.
- There you are.
- Stop!
Wait for me.
Watch out!
No!
No uniforms, no weapons, or it's martial law.
Felix, where are you?
Felix?
- Where the hell is he?
Felix?
- Not a single order.
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.
Felix?
Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?
In Wedding district, they are already showing their toddlers to the Russians.
Russian pigs.
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.
And that's the pharmacist's widow.
Her husband once cured Minister Hindenburg's headache.
That's over.
Now you step on the face and the arms of a dead woman only to get a glass of jelly.
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician.
Her husband is MIA.
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.
Look at me.
Look at me!
I will write all of this down, I will report it.
Gerd, and you shall read it.
May I offer you something?
Thank you.
From Silesia.
She won't make it.
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.
They're coming.
Halt!
Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.
All fire arms have to be turned in immediately.
This is the last warning.
Attention, attention.
This is the last warning.
Attack!
Upstairs!
All the way upstairs!
Go away!
Not now!
Attention!
I...
I have...
Careful!
Comrade Colonel.
The troops have almost reached Potsdam station.
But the order was to go towards the government district!
Understood, Comrade Colonel.
We'll stay here.
Major!
I thought we were going to the Reichstag.
No Reichstag?
But why not, we are so close.
Screw it, we are not staying here!
That's an order!
Retreat!
Secure our flank!
Understood?
Soldiers?
Officers?
Weapons?
I said:
Soldiers?
Officers?
They will see soon enough.
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.
Get out!
One person at a time.
Get out, all of you!
Move it!
- Russian filth!
- Up!
What... do you want?
Russian?
Yes.
Russian!
Come.
Come.
Eat.
War kaput.
Woman.
Come!
Eat.
War kaput, woman.
Come on.
No fear.
No fear.
We will not die here.
Bravo, come, come.
Don't be afraid.
Come.
Don't shiver!
Good!
Come.
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.
You be nice and you'll get something to eat.
Potatoes.
Very good.
May I?
Does anybody know how this thing works?
You, Ukrainian, do you know it?
There they are, our Russian liberators.
Full of joy.
It seems they can hardly believe that they've made it this far.
I know them, their sandals and villages.
Their rapidly constructed new buildings they are so proud of.
Stop!
They are without any constraints.
Don't move, asshole!
Leave her.
Get lost.
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?
That's enough!
No, seriously...
Your urine is much too old.
Back in Leningrad, I put my general back on his feet with urine...
You storyteller!
It's true.
What are they doing?
Please!
Please!
Have you husband?
A husband and two children.
Come anyway.
Quick, quick!
Let me through!
Let me through!
No, no, you pigs.
You pigs!
No!
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.
Stop.
You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
Come on, don't be so prude.
Most fellow countrymen adeptly saved their own hides.
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.
Leave!
Mrs. Hitler.
You slut!
Where to?
To the Fuhrer?
Here.
Quick.
Penthouse to the right.
Quick!
Go!
Take this and go!
Go!
Come.
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.
Soldier!
Why are you taking a woman... who doesn't want you?
Willing women are unclean.
Open the door!
Open it!
Open the door, you bastards!
Open it!
Not here.
- Where?
- Almost there.
Stop!
Stay where you are!
Hey you.
Shoo shoo!
Commander...
I am looking for the commanding officer.
What's up?
Are you in charge here?
I... we need help.
Are you in charge here?
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.
Which one do you want?
Major, sir...
We need your help...
Our men are all healthy and clean.
Mrs. Hitler.
Our country is finished.
Gerd, do you remember your first words?
"Give me 30 minutes and you will never want to leave me again."
God almighty.
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.
She took me by the hand and just led me inside her undestroyed apartment.
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.
Moving places was easy: a blouse, a few books and notebooks.
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.
Take good care of yourself.
In spite of everything, it would have been good to have a closer look around.
But then, we never know everything, so that's how the story continued.
I guess it has been really nice here once.
How did you find me here?
I searched every cellar.
How often?
Often.
The shores are clad in green, the trees are breathing freely and deeply
We bravely stride on and on, towards the final assault in this war!
Our path was long to reach this day in May.
It has cost us much strength and courage.
But now we are free again!
We proudly take our positions.
Greetings, May.
Our soldiers and a few American weapons, and those would be history.
Yeah.
Yesterday at the water pump, it was my turn, a guy approaches me,
two Iron Crosses and one German Cross in Gold on his chest, and he gallantly takes the buckets out of my hands.
And I say:
"How do I deserve this honor?" and he says "We can't give up now"
"because if the Russian even remotely does to us
"what we did to them during the last four years,
"in the near future there won't be any living Germans left."
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin!
We made it!
How do you say:
Excuse me, do you have a dictionary?
I guess he doesn't need a dictionary for what he wants.
Lenchen!
Come with us!
Come where?
Lenchen!
During the next few days, our house was raided day and night.
Lenchen!
One woman hanged herself, another one was shot to death.
None of us was spared.
Every emotion is dead.
Hey, you from Berlin!
Over here!
Upstairs.
What kept you so long?
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.
Forever!
Lenchen.
- What have you got there?
- A map.
Move it!
Faster.
You go left, I go right.
Where are you going?
Come to us.
Come.
Wake up, damned of the earth, who are living in hunger and misery.
Justice is about to burst through like glowing magma in a volcano.
You just go away, away!
I!
I love you.
Good day.
Please, don't!
My pretty one.
I'll be back.
My pretty one...
I am a young man...
You scared me.
We will survive all this,
by any means necessary.
Where to?
We're here.
Who are you looking for?
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.
So where are they now, our saviors, all the great armies?
In the past, war and dying was a male exclusive thing.
But those times are long gone.
Damned Russians.
Officer, General, Commander, doesn't matter.
I take everyone, as high in rank as possible.
From now on, I will decide who gets me.
No, no.
Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.
You can protect us from over there on the couch, see?
Protect.
Hm?
See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.
Do you understand?
Where is the Major?
Wait.
Hey, Miss.
Who are you looking for?
You, blondie.
Why are you looking so stern?
You!
Could you soap my back, huh?
Who do you want to talk to?
You.
Dismissed.
May I have a seat?
No.
Yesterday our house has been occupied and many women have been raped.
I know nothing of that.
It is your duty to help us.
Who?
My people or yours?
Me.
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.
It's pointless.
You Russian?
Looking what?
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.
Lieutenant, sir.
May I have a word?
Some of the balconies in our house are mined.
Could you help?
Pity.
Miss!
You, I, evening?
Hm?
I Anatol.
You, I, simple as that, huh?
At this moment I made a vow, that nothing and nobody would touch me, no matter what happened.
Come in.
Follow.
That's where I live.
Come on in.
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.
Well...
That's my husband.
Don't you understand?
My husband.
You must understand that.
All humans are bad.
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.
What are doing?
That is mahogany.
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.
To the 215th Rifles!
To victory!
To us.
I Charkov!
He's from Charkov.
Charkov!
Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.
An accountant?
You're kidding me.
I accountant!
You accountant!
We accountant!
Everything fine.
That's life, you see?
You, pretty.
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.
The fucking war is really pissing me off.
True.
When I get back to Charkov,
I'll marry, build a house, get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.
and you, I will take you as my accountant.
Are you a professional soldier?
No...
I, dairy.
Milk!
Milk.
Cow.
- How very interesting.
- Interesting!
Milk and milk.
That's bullshit.
Look at this.
My trophies.
That's nothing.
Here.
THAT is a trophy.
That's not a trophy.
Have a look at this.
That that is a REAL trophy.
An original.
My present to all the ladies.
To kiss and marvel about.
Where toilet?
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.
Would you like something to eat?
You.
You fancy my dick?
Doesn't matter which one.
Dick is dick.
Why Russia?
What were you doing there, you sons of a bitch?
Why Russia?
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.
He is battalion commander.
They don't have commandants, only commanders.
Did you know that they study German as first foreign language?
Well, it needs a war for us to get this bit of information.
Can I do something for you?
Hey Mongol.
Have you come all the way from Moscow just to get some water for a German woman?
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?
Made in Germany...
I am taking care of the Major.
Go now.
I'll catch up later.
Go.
Go, Mongol, go!
Move it.
Faster!
Go, go, go!
Move it already.
Faster.
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors and the whole house was rubble.
And it blasted the fattened sow up till under the roof.
Well, obviously it was spoiled.
Here.
Give it to me.
My apologies... for my unsuitable behavior.
Dismissed.
Berlin is ours.
There.
I have told everybody that they needed to go.
May I sit down?
Come here.
As you wish.
No?
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.
In every apartment.
We are Russian property now.
At their service.
But us women, we will need to keep our mouths shut, or no man will ever want to touch us again when this is all over.
Poor Germany.
German fighters: sit!
Four.
Four women.
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.
Here.
That's what I've found.
They've got everything.
They've got jewelry and money and houses.
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.
Enough.
What do I care about them?
Sometimes I think that from now on I could endure everything imaginable, as long as it comes from the outside and not from deep within my treacherous heart.
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.
A welcome committee.
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.
Anatol is a gypsy.
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.
My sun.
Do you think...
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?
No.
Never.
Here.
Is that all?
My head is aching like crazy.
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.
If that's the last thing I'll do in my life.
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.
Fuck the Reichstag.
Then he grabs me and throws me on the bed.
And suddenly, he gets so boring, like a lapdog.
Later, he complimented me.
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this."
"You, like this."
He had really bad breath.
- Oh.
It's you.
- Good morning.
We bring breakfast.
The next morning, a few blocks away the war was still raging,
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.
The widow, who loved bacon, was busy as a bee.
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard, was all too happy to surrender.
This way.
- Russian horse.
- What's that?
Sugar.
We have sugar!
And bacon and salami and bread and butter.
Great joy, but not for everybody.
Then came the cavalry.
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead, horses snuffling.
When a horse is charging, that's an incredible force.
The whole avalanche is charging against the tank, against the artillery, against all the machine guns -
All kaput.
You've had much more troops, but they just couldn't stand it.
They dropped their weapons and fled.
German soldiers, bah!
Don't be so insensitive.
We didn't start this war!
Sit down.
And stop insulting our host.
Enough.
I Caucasus.
Caucasus, understand?
Big mountain, so beautiful!
Sun, blue sky.
Nice dancing with women.
As sweet as grapes.
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.
Pushkin?
Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.
Go home, understand?
I want to see my children and my wife.
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin."
I want my wife.
My wife.
Understand?
What do you know about fascism?
Fascism?
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a "bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.
To our host.
Right.
To a woman who is quite obviously very bright.
Just like you right now.
Very bright.
But I am not a woman!
To German-Russian friendship!
Hurray!
Everybody upstairs, quick!
Hurry!
Quick!
Search all the apartments.
Out.
Out!
You goddamn bastard!
You dick!
You fucking dick!
Stop it.
Enough!
You know Stalin's orders.
Get lost.
Really?
What if I don't?
Are you gonna shoot me?
I'll kill you if I have to.
He is acting on my orders.
Stop!
A young soldier has stolen food.
He is armed.
Who is living up there?
Who is living there?
Anybody living there?
No.
She's lying.
Lying bitch.
I spit on Germany.
And on Berlin.
We conquered it, and I spit on it!
Get out of my way.
Don't move.
I'll kill you, punk!
Everyone in possession of fire arms or hiding someone with guns will be executed immediately, their houses destroyed.
They will not forget this.
Can I have something to drink?
You need to get away from here.
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.
During the next few days, the Major was here often.
Great protection for everyone.
In his coat he had tucked away candles and cigars and plenty of gifts that the widow stashed away in her kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.
On the whole, the times were changing.
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?
That is way too much.
The major speaks sophisticated Russian and told me more than I wanted to know.
Now I know about his bank account, his parents and the names of his brothers.
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.
The war continued.
While our men and husbands were sent to Siberia, many of the women found protectors which made them a taboo for the rest of the pack.
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.
Almost there.
Hold it up.
Up.
In and out, in and out.
It's like Grand Central Station in here.
Mussolini is dead.
Hanged.
He deserved it.
One asshole less.
Cheers!
As soon as Andrej had left the house, Anatol claimed his visiting rights.
I was afraid that the two top dogs would meet and kill me one day.
It's not that I could claim that this Major is raping me.
I am at his service.
A whore?
Maybe.
I have met that kind of woman only once in my life.
People told me not to talk to her because she was unsound.
Whatever that means: unsound.
Young woman!
No way.
Incredible.
There she comes prancing along as if nothing happened.
- How often?
- Four times.
You?
Come on.
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.
So do you.
Here.
Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux.
Take it.
You take that with you.
Seems you are having a good life here.
That's one way to put it.
Come on.
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.
The Major is guarding us well so that we can drink his tea without any disturbances.
That feels so good.
Where to?
What do you care?
You can't go in there.
Who's in there?
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.
So I tell him:"Young man,
"that gun there over your shoulder, that might go off."
And when I go up the stairs, on the second floor someone rushes out of the apartment, grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"
And I am in shock and I say:
- "No, surely not."
- How dumb of you.
How's your husband?
He was there when it happened the first time.
He's been a bit confused ever since.
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.
They are pretty unimaginative.
It may be that at home, they have the latest and greatest socialist planned economy, ...but their sex life is that of Adam and Eve.
That's what I told my husband, too.
With all the food shortage, a good husband isn't worth that much.
I guess a satisfactory sex life depends on regular meals.
For me, it's all about a full stomach.
No gifts, no sex!
Heart, Pain, Love, Sex Drive.
To us!
Who knows when we'll be together again.
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!
That is apple streusel cake.
Yeah, with crumbles, and it's still steaming hot.
# You, you are in my heart. #
# You, you are on my mind. #
# You, you cause me great pains, # # you don't know how much I love you. #
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
# don't know how much I love you. #
Not too much going on with our Russian men right now, am I right?
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.
Have you heard anything from Gerd?
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.
Oh my God.
How do you know you've got it?
Itching and burning.
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.
I've read it in a lexicon.
A lexicon...
Here.
An American gave that to me.
Chew it.
Good, isn't it?
Americans...
They all look like film stars.
I'm leaving.
And tell her... that I'll be back.
You got that?
What's that?
Can you protect us?
Just this one day?
I'll be here.
Where will you go...
later?
To where I am needed.
A special evening with the Major.
Good conversation.
He told me that he adores me.
And that he doesn't care about anything else.
Other than the Germans, the Russian men really appreciate educated women.
But the war hasn't ended yet.
Excuse me.
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.
Come on, kiddos, let's get out of here.
We will finish building this tower of yours.
That's him.
Good day.
You Russian?
Translate.
The German army came to my village
and killed all the children.
They have stabbed them to death,
took their bodies at the ankles...
Continue!
...and smashed their skulls on the walls of the houses.
Have you heard that?
Or did you see it with your own eyes?
I saw it.
Hey!
Why so fast?
Have you forgotten your panties?
You speak Russian, so tell him he needs to stop that.
You speak Russian, right?
Move it, you slut!
Go.
Where are you going?
I've been waiting for you.
What's wrong with you?
Comrade Major!
The old Germany is coming to an end.
Stay away from him!
He is coming to me, not the other way round.
Go away.
Why?
You Germans have hanged his wife.
Attention!
On April 30th, 1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.
He deserted all of us who have pledged allegiance to him.
Following the orders of the Fuhrer, you still believe it's your duty to defend Berlin although the supply of heavy armory, ammunition and your position make this fight utterly pointless.
With every hour you continue to fight, you prolong the horrible suffering of the civil population of Berlin... and our wounded soldiers.
From now on, everybody who dies in the battle for Berlin will have sacrificed their lives in vain.
In accordance with the leaders of the Soviet army I prompt you to cease all fighting immediately.
Breitling, Artillery General and commanding officer of the Berlin defense.
Fellow soldiers and officers of the 8th guard army.
This morning, the Berlin garrison has capitulated.
Berlin... is defeated.
I've told you we would make it!
I'll join my fellow Germans.
Go to Siberia?
What about us?
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!
Talk to me.
I've been waiting for you.
I have prayed and hoped, prayed and hoped.
No I want you to fulfill some of those hopes for me.
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!
Berlin is defeated!
To our home country!
Long live the Red Army!
Long live Stalin!
Hold on, wait a second.
What have we here?
Two halibuts.
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.
That's great!
Let's drink.
Capitulation.
The time has come.
The war is over.
Us women have been looking forward to this day so much.
So how does it feel?
Bitter, bitter defeat.
More and more people report gruesome things.
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp something in the air, mean and threatening.
I don't want to think about that right now.
It's over.
I don't know...
I'm afraid misfortune has still some tricks up its sleeves.
Do you hear that?
They drink and smoke like men.
There are 1 million women in the Russian army.
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.
Once a woman came to me, Ljuba was her name I think.
She says: "Comrade Major, I believe I will fall today.
"I want new clothes." I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.
"Bullets just avoid you." Two hours later, she comes again.
And again.
Then I tell her:
"Then the new shirt, with ties white as snow, it would be spoiled by the blood."
All female soldiers fear that when they die, they don't look pretty.
Are you a fascist?
What are you looking for?
All occupied.
And the battalion commander?
That's what I like about you Mongols.
Not a single unnecessary word.
1678 days... since I've been in this war.
And now...
And she... she's a whore.
Am I right?
This whole place... is a brothel!
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.
A pistol, huh?
Bastard!
Peace, huh?
Don't!
War kaput!
I said, move it!
Everybody downstairs.
Hurry!
All of you, downstairs.
Hurry!
Faster.
Quick!
Don't move.
Where you get weapons?
Whose apartment is that?
Who?
It's mine.
Is that hers?
It's hers.
That is crime against decree of Red Army.
Long live the Fuhrer.
Eliminate her.
You can all go to hell.
Did you know about weapons?
- No.
- Go back to apartment.
Shoot them all!
Go now.
Stop.
They're liars, all of them!
Shoot them.
Leave this woman.
She is a Hitler broad.
Do you understand?
No.
First she will be interrogated.
Do you understand?
What are you doing, brother?
This woman has sheltered an armed soldier.
The punishment for that is death.
Go, now!
I'll have to report this.
Burn them alive!
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.
Traitor!
I own whole Berlin!
Hotel Adlon, Wedding, Kaiserdamm!
Red flags everywhere.
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.
What is it?
Quarrel?
What are you looking at?
Get out of my sight.
Hey, what's up?
To victory, Commander.
To Stalin and our victory.
Wait.
You should stay with your people.
The war is over.
Here!
I get it.
Look...
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.
They love me, all of them.
Everything all right?
Do you want something to eat?
Here.
What's better?
You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?
And you, get out of here... before I shoot your nuts off!
You, listen!
We celebrate.
Everybody come, whole house.
Order!
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.
Not human.
Turd!
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!
Everyone, come now.
Order!
Fill the glasses.
What are you standing there?
We've got guests.
Why fear?
Look down there.
What do you see?
Soldiers.
Russians!
Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.
And you're right.
None of us is hesitating a single second if we can shoot a German.
Your blood is on our uniforms.
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!
Most of them didn't even know what that is, Germany.
Now come with me.
What is happening here?
Careful, that's mahogany.
Let me go!
- You dance.
Dance!
- How dare you?
This is my living room and not a dance hall.
You understand?
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.
You.
Sing?
Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.
No.
What does that mean, "no"?
That is Europe!
That is Europe!
Drink, drink.
Why not?
I'm looking at you.
And you?
Nothing.
Well, maybe next time.
To you.
I Anatol.
- I know.
- Bärbel.
My heart calls Bärbel.
Bärbel, Bärbel, Bärbel.
I play the fiddle.
Violin.
Violin?
You play the piano?
In an orchestra, but not any more.
The violin is lost.
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.
Why don't you go upstairs?
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.
We all need that.
Do you come with me?
Later.
- Sure?
- Yes.
It's good that you are here.
I want to embrace you my whole life.
I am here, you're in Moscow.
Nobody has arms that long.
Try it.
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.
"The war is over." He looked at me for a long while.
"Every newborn child cries for war," he said.
Nothing and nobody, no man, no nation, will stop this vicious circle.
Only death.
Not so fast, I am getting sick.
Gee.
Attention.
And now for everybody...
"I in love with you."
Bärbel.
Dance.
Come on, let's go.
We are not a people any more, we're only "the population".
I am talking about individuals that form within a democracy.
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.
Dance, dance, you come.
I think we should look at the greater picture here.
The countries of Europe will burst their borders.
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will, just like Napoleon did, re-order the political world map.
So we will become a Soviet republic with planned economy, huh?
Thanks.
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.
Let's start the every day life again, and we will soon get into the groove.
Slow down.
Drink.
The Soviet Union is just at the beginning of its evolution.
The future will prove that.
You love your country.
Just as I love mine.
My mother once said that one day,
I would marry a man who played the piano.
Everybody has been wondering what this day would be like.
I haven't.
Never.
I didn't want to experience it.
Why not?
If you don't do it, Andrej, I will tell you something.
War is changing the words.
"Love" is not what it used to be.
And yet,
in spite of that,
I want that my husband finds the same wife that he left behind when he returns.
Please stay.
Us women, we are branded for life.
But for here and now, right in this moment,
I feel fantastic.
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.
And mummy?
Ilse?
Ilse?
Ilse?
Ilse.
Ilse, get away from him.
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.
We went to see Felix.
You could smell the tree resin.
We came across a cloud of butterflies.
And you knew all their names.
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds, Swallowtails and many more.
One was taking a sunbath right there on the path, it was velvety brown and yellow with a blue hem.
You called it a Mourning Cloak.
So many things I've been given in my life.
In abundance.
The Major had lost everything.
Damn Russian idealist.
He takes it all like he wants the world to be.
Soviet apostle.
I like him though.
The less he wants from me, the more I like him.
Very much.
Andrej.
Andrej.
Andrej isn't here any more.
Relocated.
To where?
Unknown.
Good-bye.
"The birds so quiet, the bells are silent."
(from "18 Little Songs of the Bitter Homeland" by Yiannis Ritsos)
Isn't that how it goes?
Please, sit down.
The studio, is that gone?
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.
Ukrainians like that.
Here, that's for you.
You are shameless.
Don't you see that?
It is disgusting just to look at you.
Atten-shun!
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?
That I had the chance to get to know you.
Take care of yourself.
How are we supposed to live?
Eyes front!
"Relocation," that's what they call it.
With full honors and merits.
To Siberia, who knows?
Gerd.
My beloved Gerd.
What shall we do?
Turn back the wheel of time?
Back to your very first words?
"30 minutes", you said.
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will never want to leave me again."
What?
What?
No answer.
Two days later he was gone.
I don't know if he will come back.
I am surprised that I am not suffering more.
Maybe I am just too busy.
I need to find a piece of flint stone,
I need to mop up the floor of the apartment and I am desperately looking for some flowers.
Yesterday I found some lilac.
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.
Who knows?
Maybe our hearts have a say in this, too, and we'll see each other again, some day.
When the diary "A woman in Berlin" was first released in Germany in 1959, it was a huge scandal.
Many people said that it was a disgrace and an insult to the German women.
The author was so shocked by the rejection and the contempt that her book received.
She prohibited any further releases for as long as she lived.
And even beyond her death, here real name was never to be revealed.

The unthinkable had occurred.
It was on April 26, 1945.
The Russian army had encircled Berlin and was advancing on the Reichstag, street by street.
You could see the sun behind the clouds that day and the scent of lilacs wafted over from abandoned gardens.
Where do I start?
What are the right words?
As a journalist I had travelled to 12 countries.
I lived in Moscow, Paris and London.
I enjoyed living in Paris and London.
But I came back.
I wanted to be part of it.
My name doesn't matter.
I was just one of many who believed in my country's destiny.
Doubts were for weaklings.
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
A never-ending triumph.
Russia lacks leadership.
By the time they recover, we'll be in Moscow.
Sorry for barging in, but we happen to be at war.
The day Gerd left, his boots echoed through the house.
We were convinced we were right.
We all breathed the same air and it was intoxicating.
He helped me out of my coat...
The Russians have no idea what's going to hit them.
We were off to the Sorbonne, chattering away in French.
And he thought I was one of those big, blonde Swedes.
I skipped to get in step with him.
Then he stopped and said,
"Ah, une fille du Fuhrer."
And that was the end of that.
A shame.
One thing!
Without music...
I'd like us... to take a moment to think of our men who are scattered across Europe
and, in doing so, include them in this evening.
Run!
Get out of here!
Go!
Come here!
Get in there!
Hurry!
No uniforms and no weapons, or they'll shoot us.
Felix, where are you?
Anyone see my son?
No news.
No orders.
Nothing!
Nobody gives a damn about us.
Lenchen?
!
Where are you?
In some parts of town they're even welcoming them.
Russki swine!
They had been booksellers.
They sometimes spoke French.
And that's the pharmacist's widow.
Her husband once cured Hindenburg of a headache.
That's all over.
Now we step on the corpses of dead women just to get at a jar of jam.
That is Frau Binder, a musician.
Her husband is missing.
Can someone help me?
She can't breathe!
She...
Look at me!
I'll write it all down,
Gerd, for you to read.
Like some?
Thanks.
She's from Silesia.
Too much to take.
Hurry!
Get under there!
- Mami?
- Don't be afraid.
I'm here.
Halt!
Residents of Berlin!
Residents of this street!
All weapons must be handed over at once!
This is your last chance.
Surrender your weapons!
This is your last chance.
Go ahead!
There!
Move!
Go to the top!
Move back!
Careful!
This way!
Hurry!
Careful!
Comrade Colonel!
The men have almost reached the station.
The order was to proceed to the Reichstag.
Yes, sir, comrade Colonel!
No Reichstag?
Why not?
It's so close!
We're going on, damnit!
That's an order!
Secure the flanks!
You hear me?
What... what do you want?
Speak Russian?
Russian.
Come!
Eat.
War kaput.
Woman... come!
Eat.
War kaput, woman.
No afraid.
No afraid.
We won't let them bury us here.
Woman, come!
No afraid!
Come, come!
No afraid!
- Come!
- Pretty girls!
Come here!
Be nice and you'll get something to eat!
Potatoes.
Very good.
May I?
Who knows how this works?
Hey, Ukrainian, do you know?
So here are our Soviet liberators!
Overjoyed.
Obviously amazed at themselves for getting this far.
I know them, their sandals, villages and shabby new buildings they're so proud of.
They won't strain themselves.
Hey!
Urine!
Try some urine!
- That's enough!
- No, seriously...
Your urine is too old.
I used urine to get my general in Leningrad back on his feet...
Come on!
It's true!
Just what are they doing there?
Please!
Husband?
Husband and two children.
Come!
Now!
Let me through!
No!
- You don't belong here!
- Let me go!
I didn't do a thing!
Most of my countrymen are now very clever when it comes to saving their own skins.
- You're endangering all of us!
- The Silesian girl was an easy victim.
Go on!
Here, hurry.
The attic apartment on the right.
Hurry!
Go on!
Take it and go!
Go on!
Say something!
You speak Russian!
You can't let them do this!
Pretty woman!
Soldier!
Why do you take a woman who has no desire?
Willing women are dirty.
Open up!
Not here.
- Where?
- We're almost there.
Stop!
Come back!
Commander...
- I'm looking for a commander.
- What's wrong?
Are you the commander?
I...
We need help.
Are you the commander?
Lots of commanders.
We're all commanders.
Which one do you want?
Major...
We need your help.
All our men are healthy.
Frau Hitler!
Our country is in ruins.
Gerd, remember your first words?
You said, "Thirty minutes."
"Give me thirty minutes, and you'll never leave me."
God help us!
The back hallway.
The widow offered me a place to stay.
She led the way... to an apartment that was surprisingly intact.
I accepted.
And here...
You can stay here for the time being.
The move was easy.
A few steps up to my studio.
A blouse, a few books and some notes.
- You can stay if you like.
- Thanks.
I'd like that.
Take care.
I should have looked around a little.
But we never see everything.
And the story took its course.
This was a nice place.
How did you find me?
I searched every cellar.
How often?
Often.
The riverbanks are dressed in green.
The trees breathe lightly, deeply.
We go on fighting courageously.
In the last battle of this war.
It was a long way to this May.
It cost a lot of strength and courage.
But now we're free again.
And we proudly stand guard!
Hello, May!
Our soldiers and υS weapons...
They'd be gone!
Yes.
Yesterday at the pump, it was my turn, and somebody came up with two Iron Crosses and one German Cross in gold.
And he took my bucket gallantly.
I said, "What an honour.
I'm not used to this." He said,
"You have to be strong, ma'am."
"Because if the Russians do just a fraction of what we did to them during the last four years..."
and he said then presently no German would be left alive.
"Presently"?
Nobody says that any more.
I have a question.
How do I say:
Excuse me, do you have a dictionary?
He doesn't need one for what he wants.
Lenchen!
Come with us!
Go with them?
Where to?
Our house was stormed for the next few days.
Day and night.
One woman hung herself.
Another was shot and killed.
Nobody was spared.
Every feeling is dead.
Lenchen!
- What's that?
- A map.
Where are you going?
Come over here!
Over there!
"Stand up, wretched of the earth who are forced to starve."
"Reason thunders in its volcano.
This is the eruption of the end."
Go away!
I...
I love you!
Hello.
Please don't!
My lovely!
I come back.
My lovely.
I'm a young man.
You startled me.
We'll survive.
At all costs.
Where to?
We're here!
Where are they now?
Our rescuers?
The great armies?
War and dying used to be men's business.
That's all over.
Damn Russians!
Officer, General, Commander.
I go for the highest rank.
Starting now, I decide who gets me.
No, no, no.
Out of there!
It's still my bed!
You can protect us on the couch.
Look it up: "protect".
Like this.
You don't have to sleep in my bed.
Did you understand me?
- Where's the major?
- Wait.
Fraulein!
Who are you looking for?
Hey, blondie!
Why so glum?
How about scrubbing my back with soap?
Who would you like to talk to?
You.
Dismissed!
May I sit down?
No!
Our building was stormed yesterday and many women raped.
I know nothing of it.
It is your duty to help.
Help who?
My people or yours?
Me.
What do those few minutes matter?
It's pointless.
You speak Russian?
What you look for?
Look for officer?
Officer?
All with their women.
But I am here.
Lieutenant, may I speak to you?
Several balconies in our house are booby-trapped.
Can you help us?
Too bad.
Fraulein!
You and me, tonight?
Me Anatol.
You and me...
It's that simple.
It was then I swore that nobody would touch me, unless I let them.
No matter what.
Come in!
Follow us!
Time to go to your friends.
Hey!
That is my husband!
Don't you understand?
My husband!
You must understand.
All people are bad.
I don't understand him.
He won't leave.
What are you doing?
This is mahogany!
Calm down!
Go to the kitchen!
Me Charkov!
He comes from Charkov.
Me industrial clerk.
Accountant.
No!
Me accountant!
You accountant!
We accountant!
Everything good!
That is life.
Understand?
You, lovely!
These Russians are great.
So full of life!
It's about time all this shit was over.
Right.
When I get back to Charkov,
I'll get married and build a house, have kids, work on a kolkhoz and he'll be my accountant.
- Are you a professional soldier?
- No.
Me... dairy!
- Milk!
- Dairy?
Cow!
- That's interesting.
- No interesting!
Milk and milk...
All shit!
Look at this!
My trophies!
That's nothing!
Here!
- This is a trophy!
- That's no trophy!
Here!
Look at this!
This is a real trophy.
My present to the ladies!
For them to kiss!
Where toilet?
- Toilet in hallway.
- Thank you.
Like something else to eat?
You.
Want my cock?
Does not matter who!
Cock is cock!
Why Russia?
Why?
What's wrong with you people?
Why Russia?
This is Major...
I'm afraid I've forgotten his name.
He's the battalion commander.
They don't have a commandant.
Did you know
German is the first foreign language they learn?
It takes a war for us to discover that.
Can I do anything for you?
Hey, Mongolian!
Did you come here from Moscow to get water for a German?
Or is our major bathing in essence of roses?
A German product.
I'm responsible for the major.
Go on.
I'll be there shortly.
Go on!
Get moving, Mongolian!
Get moving!
Go!
Run, Mongolian!
Then a bomb landed in the neighbour's yard and turned the whole house into kindling.
And their pig was blown to pieces!
And no longer edible.
Here!
Let go, Masha!
Please excuse
- my behaviour.
- Dismissed.
Berlin is ours!
Here!
I told them all to leave.
May I sit down?
Come over here.
As you wish.
No?
The raping continues.
They are everywhere, in every home.
We are Russians now.
At their service.
And we women will have to keep silent.
Or no man will ever want to touch us again.
Poor Germany.
Take me with you.
Nineteen soldiers.
Four!
Four women!
Berlin is one big whorehouse!
Look at this!
They have everything!
They have jewels!
Money!
Houses!
And they make war!
Bastards!
Enough!
What do I think about them?
Sometimes I feel I could put up with anything.
As long as it comes from without and doesn't ambush me from within my heart.
I'm doing fine.
And my Russian is getting better.
- Was someone here?
- No.
What a greeting!
Madame, I've brought you a suitor.
Anatol is a Gypsy.
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protector.
My sunshine.
Do you think think the Fuhrer will abandon us?
No.
Never.
Here.
Is that all?
My head aches.
Where are you going?
To get you something to eat, if it's the last thing I do.
Why the Reichstag?
Fuck him!
And fuck the Reichstag!
Then he grabbed me and threw me on the bed, and suddenly he became very boring
like a little puppy.
And afterwards he made me a compliment.
He said,
"Ukrainians like this."
"And you like this."
But... he had such bad breath.
- Oh, it's you!
- Good morning.
We're bringing you breakfast.
The next morning, a few blocks away the war was raging, the major came with all his men.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
The widow who could be had for a scrap of bacon buzzed around like a bee.
And Herr Eckart, our Volkssturm man, was ready to surrender.
This way!
Russian horse.
What's this?
Sugar!
We have sugar!
And bacon and salami...
What a delight!
But not for everyone.
Then came the cavalry, coats flying, swords raised, horses panting.
When a horse charges, it has incredible strength.
And the whole avalanche charged the tanks, the artillery, the machine guns.
Destroyed them all!
Your soldiers outnumbered us, but they dropped their guns and ran away.
German soldiers.
- Soldiers, officers, everyone!
Afraid!
- Don't be so rude.
- We didn't start the war.
- Sit down!
- And stop insulting our hosts.
- Enough!
Me the Caucasus Mountains.
Understand?
Caucasus Mountains big, so beautiful.
Sun, mountains, blue sky!
Beautiful dances and women!
As sweet as grapes.
And Pushkin was there in exile.
I don't care about Pushkin.
I want to go home.
Home, understand?
To my wife and kids.
You see?
And you say Pushkin?
I want my wife.
My wife.
Understand?
What do you know about fascism?
Fascism?
It comes from fascio.
It means "bundle of reeds".
Very old.
Roman.
To our hostess!
- Right!
- A woman who is obviously smart!
Just like you!
Very smart!
I'm no woman!
To German-
Russian friendship!
Hurrah!
Search every apartment!
Out!
You bastard!
You scum!
Stop!
Enough!
You know Stalin's decree!
Just stop!
What if I don't?
Will you shoot me?
If I have to, I'll shoot you.
He's acting on my orders.
Halt!
A young German stole some food.
He's armed.
Who lives up there?
Who lives there?
Does anyone live there?
No.
You're lying!
You're a lying bitch!
I spit on Germany and Berlin!
We defeated them!
I spit on them!
Out of my way!
Halt!
I'll kill you, you bastard!
Everyone in possession of a weapon or who hides someone in possession of a weapon will be shot at once!
And the house will be razed!
They'll never forgive you!
Can I have something to drink?
You have to leave.
What are you doing here?
I'm not going to Siberia.
I'm not going.
The next few days the major came and went.
It meant protection for everyone.
He brought candles, cigars and lots of presents which the widow quickly stowed away in her cupboard.
In a way, a new era was beginning.
A lot of Russian men like to play Santa Claus.
Why should we women stop them?
That's way too much!
The major speaks eloquent Russian and he told me more than I wanted to know.
I know his bank account, his parents' and his brothers' names.
You're our guest today.
Now sit down.
You are so old-fashioned.
I love to touch him.
Let's go!
The war raged on.
While our men were being sent to Siberia, many women sought protectors and became taboo for the rest.
Careful!
It's a Singer.
Not much further.
Hold it up!
In and out, in and out!
It's like a train station in here.
Mussolini is dead!
They hung him upside down!
Andrei had scarcely left when Anatol showed up.
I was scared to death the two alpha males would meet with me in the middle.
I can't really say the major rapes me.
I am at his disposal.
A whore?
Perhaps.
I only met a whore once in my life.
People said not to talk to her, that she was bad.
What does that mean anyway?
Bad.
Young lady!
No!
Well, well...
Along she comes as if everything were fine.
How often?
Four times.
You?
Come on!
- I never thought I'd see you again!
- You look good!
You do!
Here, quince jam.
A real Bordeaux!
Take it!
How classy!
You're spoiled!
That's one way of putting it.
I'm so happy you're here.
Elke's visit cheered us all up.
The major's guards protect us as we drink his tea in peace.
It does us the world of good.
- Where are you going?
- What's it to you?
- You can't go in.
- Who's there?
So I said, "Young man, that rifle on your shoulder could accidentally go off."
And me?
I was going upstairs, and somebody on the 2nd floor fired a shot from inside and grabbed me by the hair and said, "You syphilis."
I was terrified and said,
"No, not me!"
What an idiot.
How's your husband?
He was with me the first time and is still a bit disturbed.
- What do you think of our cavaliers?
- Not impressed.
They have no imagination.
At home they may have the latest planned economy, but when it comes to eroticism, they're like Adam and Eve.
- That's what I told my husband.
- With our scanty rations, your good old husband isn't worth much either.
Well...
I guess for a good love life you need regular meals.
My focal point is my belly.
No food, no fun.
Romance, pain, love, lust...
- To us!
- Cheers!
Who knows when we'll meet again!
Careful!
It's hot!
- Apple pie!
- Yes, with crumble.
It's singing to me.
You, you, you're in my heart
You, you, you're on my mind
You, you cause me such pain
- You don't know just how good I am
- Oh, yes...
You don't know just how good I am
Our men aren't what they used to be, either.
They're so weak it's hard just to look at them.
The weaker sex.
Have you heard from Gerd?
I have a question about syphilis.
Oh, God!
How do you notice it?
Itching, stinging.
And little boils.
They show up later.
I read it in an encyclopedia.
An encyclopedia!
Here, an American gave me this.
Chew it!
Cool, huh?
Americans...
They all look like actors.
Handsome, like from the movies.
I'm going.
Tell her
I'll be back!
Hear me?
What is it?
A mission.
Can we count on you?
When the day comes.
I'll be here.
Where will you go...
later?
Where I'm needed.
A special evening with the major.
A good conversation.
He said I was marvellous.
Nothing else mattered to him.
Contrary to German men, Russian men appreciated educated women.
But... the war wasn't over yet.
Excuse me.
Do you have a moment?
We...
We need your help.
Come on, kids.
Leave the room.
We'll finish building your tower.
It's him.
Hello.
You Russian?
Translate!
In my village, German soldiers killed all the children.
They took them stabbed them.
They grabbed them by the feet...
Go on!
...threw them against the walls and smashed their skulls.
Hearsay?
Or did you see it?
I saw it.
Hey, what's the hurry?
Did you forget your underwear?
You speak Russian!
Tell him I have a family!
Tell him to leave me alone!
You speak Russian!
Help!
Where are you going?
I was waiting for you.
What's wrong?
Comrade Major.
Old Germany is finished.
Keep your hands off him!
He comes to me.
I don't go to him.
Go away!
Why?
You people hung his wife.
Residents of Berlin!
On 30 April, 1945 the Fuhrer killed himself,
and betrayed all those who swore allegiance to him.
The Fuhrer's orders were for you to defend Berlin.
But the lack of heavy artillery and ammunition and the entire situation make any further fighting meaningless.
Every hour you go on fighting prolongs the dreadful suffering of Berlin's civilian population and of our wounded.
All those who now die in the battle for Berlin are sacrificing themselves for nothing.
In agreement with the Supreme Command of the Soviet Army, I order you to immediately cease all combat operations.
Weidling,
General of the Artillery and Commander of the Defence Area of Berlin.
Comrade soldiers and officers of the 8th Red Army, this morning, the Berlin Garrison surrendered!
Berlin is defeated.
I'm going back to my people.
To Siberia?
What about us?
Talk to me, Friedrich!
Please!
Talk to me!
I waited for you!
I prayed.
And I hoped.
I prayed and hoped.
And now I want you to at least try
to stand by me.
To victory!
Berlin is defeated!
To the homeland!
Long live the Red Army!
Long live Stalin!
Just a moment!
What do we have here?
Two halibuts!
- Unbelievable!
- Hitler,
Goebbels... kaput!
Great!
Let's drink!
Capitulation.
At long last.
The war is over!
How we women longed for that.
But now?
A very bitter defeat.
More and more people are talking about horrific things.
I sense an eerie something in the air.
Evil and menacing.
I don't want to think about it now.
It's all over.
I don't know.
I fear that misfortune has a greater imagination.
Listen.
They are drinking and smoking like men.
The Russian Army has one million women.
They come from everywhere.
We have no uniforms.
The boots are too large.
Shirts and jackets... a disaster.
One of the girls came to me.
I think her name was Luba.
She said,
"Major, I believe I will be killed today."
"I want fresh clothes." I said, "No!"
"You've been with us for a long time.
The bullets avoid you."
She came back two hours later.
And again and again.
So I said, "Yes."
She got a new shirt with ribbons here.
As white as snow.
It was full of blood.
Every female soldier is afraid of not being pretty when they die.
Are you a Fascist?
Where are you going?
They're all taken!
The battalion commander?
That's what I like about you Mongolians.
Not a word too many.
1,678 days
I've been at war.
And now...
And she...
She's a whore, right?
The whole place is a whorehouse.
You come with me!
A gun, huh?
Peace, huh?
War kaput!
Get there, I said!
Everybody downstairs!
Hurry!
Everybody downstairs!
Let's go!
Halt!
Where's the gun from?
Whose apartment is it?
Whose?
Mine.
Is this hers?
It's hers.
This is a violation of Red Army regulations!
Long live the Fuhrer!
Liquidate her!
I hope you all die!
Did you know about the gun?
No.
Go back to your apartments.
- Shoot them all!
- Go on!
- Halt!
- They're all liars!
Shoot them!
Forget the woman!
- She's a Nazi!
- Did you understand me?
No.
You will be questioned first.
- Did you understand me?
- What are you doing?
She hid an armed soldier!
That's grounds for execution!
Go!
I'll have to report this.
Torch them!
How could you risk that?
You jeopardised us all!
Got the Nazi monster in its own burrow.
The garrison of the German capital has capitulated.
Traitor!
Me go all Berlin!
Hotel Adlon, Wedding, Kaiserdamm!
Everywhere red flags!
Red flags!
Nice flags, good quality.
What's wrong?
Fighting?
Stop staring!
Go on!
What's wrong?
To our victory, Commander!
To Stalin!
To Stalin!
Wait!
Stay with your people!
The war is over!
Here!
I've got them.
Just you look.
Ljuba, Marina, Olga, Thekla.
And they all love me.
All of them.
Everything good?
Want something to eat?
Here!
What's better?
Tell me!
His prick or my bike?
Get out before I shoot your balls off!
We're celebrating.
Everybody, come!
The whole house!
It's an order!
Your Hitler is no human!
He is stinking filth.
No human!
Filth!
Lenchen, they're yelling upstairs!
Everybody!
Come up!
It's an order!
Fill it up.
Why are you standing around?
We have guests.
Why afraid?
Look down there.
You see...?
Soldiers.
Russians!
Beasts!
Or animals, as you say.
That's right.
Not one of us would hesitate a second to shoot a German.
Your blood is on our uniforms, and that's good.
None of them wanted to go to war.
Most of them didn't even know what it was...
Germany.
And now come with me.
What is going on here?
Careful!
It's mahogany!
Let me go!
- You dance!
- Are you crazy?
This is my living room and not a dance hall.
- You understand?
- Fantastic!
Not a dance hall!
Drink schnapps.
Vodka, schnapps good.
You...
Sing?
He wants me to sing.
I'm not going to sing.
- What does he want?
- What do you think?
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?
No, no, no...
This is Europe!
Europe!
Why not?
I look at you.
And you?
Nothing!
Next time!
To you!
Me Anatol.
- I know.
- Barbel.
My heart calls out:
Barbel...
I play the violin.
The violin.
- Fiddle.
- You play the piano?
In an orchestra, but not any more.
My violin is gone.
That's good.
I want to play the piano, too.
Why don't you go upstairs?
Should I?
Why not?
We all should.
- Will you come, too?
- Later.
- Really?
- Sure.
It's good to have you here.
I want to embrace you.
For the rest of my life.
Me here, you in Moscow.
Nobody has arms that long.
Try!
The major asked me to call him Andrei.
"Why not," I said. "The war is over."
He gazed at me for a long time.
"Every newborn child yells for war,"
he said.
And that nothing, no person or nation, could stop that cycle.
Except death.
Not fast enough!
Faster!
Everybody!
Listen!
And now the song...
I Am So In Love With You.
Dance!
Come on!
We're no longer a people.
We're a population.
I mean individuals who come together in a democracy and work hard for prosperity.
Dance!
We shouldn't see it within a small framework.
European countries will overcome their borders and grow together.
Like Napoleon, the victorious powers will get rid of countries and nations.
And we'll become a Soviet republic with planned economy nonsense!
Thank you. I...
Herr Hoch, feeling better?
We have to be practical.
Things will get better.
Not so fast!
Drink!
Drink!
The Soviet Union has just started to develop.
The future will tell.
You love your country.
Just as I love mine.
My mother once said
I would marry a man who plays the piano.
Everyone always wondered what this day would be like.
Not me.
Never.
I didn't want to experience it.
Why not?
If you don't tell me, then I'll tell you, Andrei.
War changes our words.
Love is no longer what it once was.
And still...
I still want... my husband to find the woman... he left behind.
Don't go!
We women have been branded for life.
But for the time being, at this very moment,
I feel just fine.
I'll get us tea.
Ilse has some.
Morning, Lenchen.
Is anybody up yet?
Where's Vanya?
At work.
And Mama?
Ilse, come on, get up!
Gerd, do you remember?
It was a Tuesday.
Let's go and see Felix.
We could smell the pine resin.
Want to?
We were engulfed in a cloud of butterflies.
And you knew each one by name.
Common blue, Brimstone,
Firebird, Swallowtail and so many more.
One was sunning itself on the path, velvet brown, yellow and blue trim.
You said it was a Mourning Cloak.
I've had so many things in my life, an over-abundance.
The major lost everything.
Damn Russian idealist!
He sees himself the way he wants the world to be.
A Soviet true believer!
But I like him.
The less he wants from me, the more I like him.
Very much.
Andrei?
Andrei is no longer here.
Transferred.
Where to?
Who knows?
Goodbye.
"The birds are silent.
The bells are hushed."
Isn't that how it goes?
Sit down.
The studio?
Is it gone?
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.
Ukrainians like this...
Here, for you.
You're all shameless.
Don't you realise that?
It's disgusting just to look at you!
Attention!
I want to thank you.
What for?
Being allowed to know you.
Take care of yourself.
How do we go on living?
Attention!
Transferred!
That's what they call it.
An honourable transfer.
To Siberia.
Who knows?
Gerd, my beloved Gerd.
What do we do now?
Turn back the hands of time?
Back to the first words you said.
You said, "30 minutes."
"Just give me 30 minutes and you'll never leave me."
What?
No answer.
Two days later he was gone.
I don't know if he'll be back.
I'm surprised it doesn't hurt any more.
But I have so much to do.
I have to find a flint stone.
Mop up the puddles in the studio and scavenge for greens.
I found some lilacs yesterday.
Does Gerd ever think of me?
Who knows?
Maybe his heart will speak again and I'll see him...
Sometime.
WHEN THE DIARY "ANONYMA:
THE DOWNFALL OF BERLIN"
WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN GERMANY IN 1959,
IT WAS INDIGNANTLY REJECTED, IT WAS A DISGRACE TO GERMAN WOMEN.
SHOCKED BY THE CONTEMPT OF HER CONTEMPORARIES,
THE AUTHOR FORBID FURTHER PUBLISHING OF HER BOOK UNTIL HER DEATH.
AND EVEN AFTER SHE WAS GONE, HER NAME WAS TO BE KEPT SECRET.
Anonyma
A Woman in Berlin
Who would've thought that?
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin and now they were heading towards the Reichstag.
On this day, you could see the sun behind the clouds, and the smell of lilac wafted through all the smoke.
How to start?
How to find the right words?
I've been a journalist, I've traveled 12 countries.
Been living in Moscow, Paris and London.
I really liked to stay in Paris and London.
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.
My name doesn't matter.
I am one of the many who fervently believed in our country's future.
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.
Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.
The Russians don't have a leader.
When they finally come to their senses, we are already knocking at their front door in Moscow.
Pardon our pushiness, but it's war after all.
Gerd hated railway stations.
When he left, the sound of his boots filled the house.
We were certain to do the right thing, we breathed the same air as everybody else.
We were part of this.
And then he takes off my coat and says:
The Russians have no idea what's coming towards them.
So we were heading towards the Sorbonne and chatting away in French.
He thought that I was one of those tall blond Swedes.
Then I made a double step to match my stride to his.
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.
Hold on.
I...
I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.
I would like for us all to share this moment, this wonderful evening, with our husbands who are stationed somewhere all over Europe.
Get lost!
Run, run!
Get away!
Go away!
Houses on the right.
Fan out.
Come here, damn it!
Mummy, where are you?
Come on.
Hurry.
Away.
Go away.
Open fire, reload grenade.
...and fire!
Fire!
Shit.
- Wait for me.
- Watch out!
Heads down.
- There you are.
- Stop!
Wait for me.
Watch out!
No!
No uniforms, no weapons, or it's martial law.
Felix, where are you?
Felix?
- Where the hell is he?
Felix?
- Not a single order.
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.
Felix?
Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?
In Wedding district, they are already showing their toddlers to the Russians.
Russian pigs.
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.
And that's the pharmacist's widow.
Her husband once cured Minister Hindenburg's headache.
That's over.
Now you step on the face and the arms of a dead woman only to get a glass of jelly.
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician.
Her husband is MIA.
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.
Look at me.
Look at me!
I will write all of this down, I will report it.
Gerd, and you shall read it.
May I offer you something?
Thank you.
From Silesia.
She won't make it.
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.
They're coming.
Halt!
Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.
All fire arms have to be turned in immediately.
This is the last warning.
Attention, attention.
This is the last warning.
Attack!
Upstairs!
All the way upstairs!
Go away!
Not now!
Attention!
I...
I have...
Careful!
Comrade Colonel.
The troops have almost reached Potsdam station.
But the order was to go towards the government district!
Understood, Comrade Colonel.
We'll stay here.
Major!
I thought we were going to the Reichstag.
No Reichstag?
But why not, we are so close.
Screw it, we are not staying here!
That's an order!
Retreat!
Secure our flank!
Understood?
Soldiers?
Officers?
Weapons?
I said:
Soldiers?
Officers?
They will see soon enough.
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.
Get out!
One person at a time.
Get out, all of you!
Move it!
- Russian filth!
- Up!
What... do you want?
Russian?
Yes.
Russian!
Come.
Come.
Eat.
War kaput.
Woman.
Come!
Eat.
War kaput, woman.
Come on.
No fear.
No fear.
We will not die here.
Bravo, come, come.
Don't be afraid.
Come.
Don't shiver!
Good!
Come.
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.
You be nice and you'll get something to eat.
Potatoes.
Very good.
May I?
Does anybody know how this thing works?
You, Ukrainian, do you know it?
There they are, our Russian liberators.
Full of joy.
It seems they can hardly believe that they've made it this far.
I know them, their sandals and villages.
Their rapidly constructed new buildings they are so proud of.
Stop!
They are without any constraints.
Don't move, asshole!
Leave her.
Get lost.
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?
That's enough!
No, seriously...
Your urine is much too old.
Back in Leningrad, I put my general back on his feet with urine...
You storyteller!
It's true.
What are they doing?
Please!
Please!
Have you husband?
A husband and two children.
Come anyway.
Quick, quick!
Let me through!
Let me through!
No, no, you pigs.
You pigs!
No!
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.
Stop.
You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
Come on, don't be so prude.
Most fellow countrymen adeptly saved their own hides.
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.
Leave!
Mrs. Hitler.
You slut!
Where to?
To the Fuhrer?
Here.
Quick.
Penthouse to the right.
Quick!
Go!
Take this and go!
Go!
Come.
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.
Soldier!
Why are you taking a woman... who doesn't want you?
Willing women are unclean.
Open the door!
Open it!
Open the door, you bastards!
Open it!
Not here.
- Where?
- Almost there.
Stop!
Stay where you are!
Hey you.
Shoo shoo!
Commander...
I am looking for the commanding officer.
What's up?
Are you in charge here?
I... we need help.
Are you in charge here?
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.
Which one do you want?
Major, sir...
We need your help...
Our men are all healthy and clean.
Mrs. Hitler.
Our country is finished.
Gerd, do you remember your first words?
"Give me 30 minutes and you will never want to leave me again."
God almighty.
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.
She took me by the hand and just led me inside her undestroyed apartment.
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.
Moving places was easy: a blouse, a few books and notebooks.
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.
Take good care of yourself.
In spite of everything, it would have been good to have a closer look around.
But then, we never know everything, so that's how the story continued.
I guess it has been really nice here once.
How did you find me here?
I searched every cellar.
How often?
Often.
The shores are clad in green, the trees are breathing freely and deeply
We bravely stride on and on, towards the final assault in this war!
Our path was long to reach this day in May.
It has cost us much strength and courage.
But now we are free again!
We proudly take our positions.
Greetings, May.
Our soldiers and a few American weapons, and those would be history.
Yeah.
Yesterday at the water pump, it was my turn, a guy approaches me,
two Iron Crosses and one German Cross in Gold on his chest, and he gallantly takes the buckets out of my hands.
And I say:
"How do I deserve this honor?" and he says "We can't give up now"
"because if the Russian even remotely does to us
"what we did to them during the last four years,
"in the near future there won't be any living Germans left."
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin!
We made it!
How do you say:
Excuse me, do you have a dictionary?
I guess he doesn't need a dictionary for what he wants.
Lenchen!
Come with us!
Come where?
Lenchen!
During the next few days, our house was raided day and night.
Lenchen!
One woman hanged herself, another one was shot to death.
None of us was spared.
Every emotion is dead.
Hey, you from Berlin!
Over here!
Upstairs.
What kept you so long?
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.
Forever!
Lenchen.
- What have you got there?
- A map.
Move it!
Faster.
You go left, I go right.
Where are you going?
Come to us.
Come.
Wake up, damned of the earth, who are living in hunger and misery.
Justice is about to burst through like glowing magma in a volcano.
You just go away, away!
I!
I love you.
Good day.
Please, don't!
My pretty one.
I'll be back.
My pretty one...
I am a young man...
You scared me.
We will survive all this,
by any means necessary.
Where to?
We're here.
Who are you looking for?
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.
So where are they now, our saviors, all the great armies?
In the past, war and dying was a male exclusive thing.
But those times are long gone.
Damned Russians.
Officer, General, Commander, doesn't matter.
I take everyone, as high in rank as possible.
From now on, I will decide who gets me.
No, no.
Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.
You can protect us from over there on the couch, see?
Protect.
Hm?
See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.
Do you understand?
Where is the Major?
Wait.
Hey, Miss.
Who are you looking for?
You, blondie.
Why are you looking so stern?
You!
Could you soap my back, huh?
Who do you want to talk to?
You.
Dismissed.
May I have a seat?
No.
Yesterday our house has been occupied and many women have been raped.
I know nothing of that.
It is your duty to help us.
Who?
My people or yours?
Me.
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.
It's pointless.
You Russian?
Looking what?
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.
Lieutenant, sir.
May I have a word?
Some of the balconies in our house are mined.
Could you help?
Pity.
Miss!
You, I, evening?
Hm?
I Anatol.
You, I, simple as that, huh?
At this moment I made a vow, that nothing and nobody would touch me, no matter what happened.
Come in.
Follow.
That's where I live.
Come on in.
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.
Well...
That's my husband.
Don't you understand?
My husband.
You must understand that.
All humans are bad.
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.
What are doing?
That is mahogany.
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.
To the 215th Rifles!
To victory!
To us.
I Charkov!
He's from Charkov.
Charkov!
Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.
An accountant?
You're kidding me.
I accountant!
You accountant!
We accountant!
Everything fine.
That's life, you see?
You, pretty.
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.
The fucking war is really pissing me off.
True.
When I get back to Charkov,
I'll marry, build a house, get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.
and you, I will take you as my accountant.
Are you a professional soldier?
No...
I, dairy.
Milk!
Milk.
Cow.
- How very interesting.
- Interesting!
Milk and milk.
That's bullshit.
Look at this.
My trophies.
That's nothing.
Here.
THAT is a trophy.
That's not a trophy.
Have a look at this.
That that is a REAL trophy.
An original.
My present to all the ladies.
To kiss and marvel about.
Where toilet?
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.
Would you like something to eat?
You.
You fancy my dick?
Doesn't matter which one.
Dick is dick.
Why Russia?
What were you doing there, you sons of a bitch?
Why Russia?
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.
He is battalion commander.
They don't have commandants, only commanders.
Did you know that they study German as first foreign language?
Well, it needs a war for us to get this bit of information.
Can I do something for you?
Hey Mongol.
Have you come all the way from Moscow just to get some water for a German woman?
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?
Made in Germany...
I am taking care of the Major.
Go now.
I'll catch up later.
Go.
Go, Mongol, go!
Move it.
Faster!
Go, go, go!
Move it already.
Faster.
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors and the whole house was rubble.
And it blasted the fattened sow up till under the roof.
Well, obviously it was spoiled.
Here.
Give it to me.
My apologies... for my unsuitable behavior.
Dismissed.
Berlin is ours.
There.
I have told everybody that they needed to go.
May I sit down?
Come here.
As you wish.
No?
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.
In every apartment.
We are Russian property now.
At their service.
But us women, we will need to keep our mouths shut, or no man will ever want to touch us again when this is all over.
Poor Germany.
German fighters: sit!
Four.
Four women.
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.
Here.
That's what I've found.
They've got everything.
They've got jewelry and money and houses.
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.
Enough.
What do I care about them?
Sometimes I think that from now on I could endure everything imaginable, as long as it comes from the outside and not from deep within my treacherous heart.
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.
A welcome committee.
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.
Anatol is a gypsy.
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.
My sun.
Do you think...
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?
No.
Never.
Here.
Is that all?
My head is aching like crazy.
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.
If that's the last thing I'll do in my life.
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.
Fuck the Reichstag.
Then he grabs me and throws me on the bed.
And suddenly, he gets so boring, like a lapdog.
Later, he complimented me.
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this."
"You, like this."
He had really bad breath.
- Oh.
It's you.
- Good morning.
We bring breakfast.
The next morning, a few blocks away the war was still raging,
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.
The widow, who loved bacon, was busy as a bee.
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard, was all too happy to surrender.
This way.
- Russian horse.
- What's that?
Sugar.
We have sugar!
And bacon and salami and bread and butter.
Great joy, but not for everybody.
Then came the cavalry.
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead, horses snuffling.
When a horse is charging, that's an incredible force.
The whole avalanche is charging against the tank, against the artillery, against all the machine guns -
All kaput.
You've had much more troops, but they just couldn't stand it.
They dropped their weapons and fled.
German soldiers, bah!
Don't be so insensitive.
We didn't start this war!
Sit down.
And stop insulting our host.
Enough.
I Caucasus.
Caucasus, understand?
Big mountain, so beautiful!
Sun, blue sky.
Nice dancing with women.
As sweet as grapes.
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.
Pushkin?
Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.
Go home, understand?
I want to see my children and my wife.
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin."
I want my wife.
My wife.
Understand?
What do you know about fascism?
Fascism?
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a "bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.
To our host.
Right.
To a woman who is quite obviously very bright.
Just like you right now.
Very bright.
But I am not a woman!
To German-Russian friendship!
Hurray!
Everybody upstairs, quick!
Hurry!
Quick!
Search all the apartments.
Out.
Out!
You goddamn bastard!
You dick!
You fucking dick!
Stop it.
Enough!
You know Stalin's orders.
Get lost.
Really?
What if I don't?
Are you gonna shoot me?
I'll kill you if I have to.
He is acting on my orders.
Stop!
A young soldier has stolen food.
He is armed.
Who is living up there?
Who is living there?
Anybody living there?
No.
She's lying.
Lying bitch.
I spit on Germany.
And on Berlin.
We conquered it, and I spit on it!
Get out of my way.
Don't move.
I'll kill you, punk!
Everyone in possession of fire arms or hiding someone with guns will be executed immediately, their houses destroyed.
They will not forget this.
Can I have something to drink?
You need to get away from here.
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.
During the next few days, the Major was here often.
Great protection for everyone.
In his coat he had tucked away candles and cigars and plenty of gifts that the widow stashed away in her kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.
On the whole, the times were changing.
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?
That is way too much.
The major speaks sophisticated Russian and told me more than I wanted to know.
Now I know about his bank account, his parents and the names of his brothers.
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.
The war continued.
While our men and husbands were sent to Siberia, many of the women found protectors which made them a taboo for the rest of the pack.
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.
Almost there.
Hold it up.
Up.
In and out, in and out.
It's like Grand Central Station in here.
Mussolini is dead.
Hanged.
He deserved it.
One asshole less.
Cheers!
As soon as Andrej had left the house, Anatol claimed his visiting rights.
I was afraid that the two top dogs would meet and kill me one day.
It's not that I could claim that this Major is raping me.
I am at his service.
A whore?
Maybe.
I have met that kind of woman only once in my life.
People told me not to talk to her because she was unsound.
Whatever that means: unsound.
Young woman!
No way.
Incredible.
There she comes prancing along as if nothing happened.
- How often?
- Four times.
You?
Come on.
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.
So do you.
Here.
Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux.
Take it.
You take that with you.
Seems you are having a good life here.
That's one way to put it.
Come on.
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.
The Major is guarding us well so that we can drink his tea without any disturbances.
That feels so good.
Where to?
What do you care?
You can't go in there.
Who's in there?
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.
So I tell him:"Young man,
"that gun there over your shoulder, that might go off."
And when I go up the stairs, on the second floor someone rushes out of the apartment, grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"
And I am in shock and I say:
- "No, surely not."
- How dumb of you.
How's your husband?
He was there when it happened the first time.
He's been a bit confused ever since.
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.
They are pretty unimaginative.
It may be that at home, they have the latest and greatest socialist planned economy, ...but their sex life is that of Adam and Eve.
That's what I told my husband, too.
With all the food shortage, a good husband isn't worth that much.
I guess a satisfactory sex life depends on regular meals.
For me, it's all about a full stomach.
No gifts, no sex!
Heart, Pain, Love, Sex Drive.
To us!
Who knows when we'll be together again.
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!
That is apple streusel cake.
Yeah, with crumbles, and it's still steaming hot.
# You, you are in my heart. #
# You, you are on my mind. #
# You, you cause me great pains, # # you don't know how much I love you. #
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
# don't know how much I love you. #
Not too much going on with our Russian men right now, am I right?
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.
Have you heard anything from Gerd?
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.
Oh my God.
How do you know you've got it?
Itching and burning.
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.
I've read it in a lexicon.
A lexicon...
Here.
An American gave that to me.
Chew it.
Good, isn't it?
Americans...
They all look like film stars.
I'm leaving.
And tell her... that I'll be back.
You got that?
What's that?
Can you protect us?
Just this one day?
I'll be here.
Where will you go...
later?
To where I am needed.
A special evening with the Major.
Good conversation.
He told me that he adores me.
And that he doesn't care about anything else.
Other than the Germans, the Russian men really appreciate educated women.
But the war hasn't ended yet.
Excuse me.
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.
Come on, kiddos, let's get out of here.
We will finish building this tower of yours.
That's him.
Good day.
You Russian?
Translate.
The German army came to my village
and killed all the children.
They have stabbed them to death,
took their bodies at the ankles...
Continue!
...and smashed their skulls on the walls of the houses.
Have you heard that?
Or did you see it with your own eyes?
I saw it.
Hey!
Why so fast?
Have you forgotten your panties?
You speak Russian, so tell him he needs to stop that.
You speak Russian, right?
Move it, you slut!
Go.
Where are you going?
I've been waiting for you.
What's wrong with you?
Comrade Major!
The old Germany is coming to an end.
Stay away from him!
He is coming to me, not the other way round.
Go away.
Why?
You Germans have hanged his wife.
Attention!
On April 30th, 1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.
He deserted all of us who have pledged allegiance to him.
Following the orders of the Fuhrer, you still believe it's your duty to defend Berlin although the supply of heavy armory, ammunition and your position make this fight utterly pointless.
With every hour you continue to fight, you prolong the horrible suffering of the civil population of Berlin... and our wounded soldiers.
From now on, everybody who dies in the battle for Berlin will have sacrificed their lives in vain.
In accordance with the leaders of the Soviet army I prompt you to cease all fighting immediately.
Breitling, Artillery General and commanding officer of the Berlin defense.
Fellow soldiers and officers of the 8th guard army.
This morning, the Berlin garrison has capitulated.
Berlin... is defeated.
I've told you we would make it!
I'll join my fellow Germans.
Go to Siberia?
What about us?
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!
Talk to me.
I've been waiting for you.
I have prayed and hoped, prayed and hoped.
No I want you to fulfill some of those hopes for me.
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!
Berlin is defeated!
To our home country!
Long live the Red Army!
Long live Stalin!
Hold on, wait a second.
What have we here?
Two halibuts.
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.
That's great!
Let's drink.
Capitulation.
The time has come.
The war is over.
Us women have been looking forward to this day so much.
So how does it feel?
Bitter, bitter defeat.
More and more people report gruesome things.
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp something in the air, mean and threatening.
I don't want to think about that right now.
It's over.
I don't know...
I'm afraid misfortune has still some tricks up its sleeves.
Do you hear that?
They drink and smoke like men.
There are 1 million women in the Russian army.
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.
Once a woman came to me, Ljuba was her name I think.
She says: "Comrade Major, I believe I will fall today.
"I want new clothes." I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.
"Bullets just avoid you." Two hours later, she comes again.
And again.
Then I tell her:
"Then the new shirt, with ties white as snow, it would be spoiled by the blood."
All female soldiers fear that when they die, they don't look pretty.
Are you a fascist?
What are you looking for?
All occupied.
And the battalion commander?
That's what I like about you Mongols.
Not a single unnecessary word.
1678 days... since I've been in this war.
And now...
And she... she's a whore.
Am I right?
This whole place... is a brothel!
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.
A pistol, huh?
Bastard!
Peace, huh?
Don't!
War kaput!
I said, move it!
Everybody downstairs.
Hurry!
All of you, downstairs.
Hurry!
Faster.
Quick!
Don't move.
Where you get weapons?
Whose apartment is that?
Who?
It's mine.
Is that hers?
It's hers.
That is crime against decree of Red Army.
Long live the Fuhrer.
Eliminate her.
You can all go to hell.
Did you know about weapons?
- No.
- Go back to apartment.
Shoot them all!
Go now.
Stop.
They're liars, all of them!
Shoot them.
Leave this woman.
She is a Hitler broad.
Do you understand?
No.
First she will be interrogated.
Do you understand?
What are you doing, brother?
This woman has sheltered an armed soldier.
The punishment for that is death.
Go, now!
I'll have to report this.
Burn them alive!
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.
Traitor!
I own whole Berlin!
Hotel Adlon, Wedding, Kaiserdamm!
Red flags everywhere.
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.
What is it?
Quarrel?
What are you looking at?
Get out of my sight.
Hey, what's up?
To victory, Commander.
To Stalin and our victory.
Wait.
You should stay with your people.
The war is over.
Here!
I get it.
Look...
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.
They love me, all of them.
Everything all right?
Do you want something to eat?
Here.
What's better?
You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?
And you, get out of here... before I shoot your nuts off!
You, listen!
We celebrate.
Everybody come, whole house.
Order!
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.
Not human.
Turd!
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!
Everyone, come now.
Order!
Fill the glasses.
What are you standing there?
We've got guests.
Why fear?
Look down there.
What do you see?
Soldiers.
Russians!
Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.
And you're right.
None of us is hesitating a single second if we can shoot a German.
Your blood is on our uniforms.
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!
Most of them didn't even know what that is, Germany.
Now come with me.
What is happening here?
Careful, that's mahogany.
Let me go!
- You dance.
Dance!
- How dare you?
This is my living room and not a dance hall.
You understand?
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.
You.
Sing?
Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.
No.
What does that mean, "no"?
That is Europe!
That is Europe!
Drink, drink.
Why not?
I'm looking at you.
And you?
Nothing.
Well, maybe next time.
To you.
I Anatol.
- I know.
- Bärbel.
My heart calls Bärbel.
Bärbel, Bärbel, Bärbel.
I play the fiddle.
Violin.
Violin?
You play the piano?
In an orchestra, but not any more.
The violin is lost.
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.
Why don't you go upstairs?
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.
We all need that.
Do you come with me?
Later.
- Sure?
- Yes.
It's good that you are here.
I want to embrace you my whole life.
I am here, you're in Moscow.
Nobody has arms that long.
Try it.
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.
"The war is over." He looked at me for a long while.
"Every newborn child cries for war," he said.
Nothing and nobody, no man, no nation, will stop this vicious circle.
Only death.
Not so fast, I am getting sick.
Gee.
Attention.
And now for everybody...
"I in love with you."
Bärbel.
Dance.
Come on, let's go.
We are not a people any more, we're only "the population".
I am talking about individuals that form within a democracy.
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.
Dance, dance, you come.
I think we should look at the greater picture here.
The countries of Europe will burst their borders.
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will, just like Napoleon did, re-order the political world map.
So we will become a Soviet republic with planned economy, huh?
Thanks.
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.
Let's start the every day life again, and we will soon get into the groove.
Slow down.
Drink.
The Soviet Union is just at the beginning of its evolution.
The future will prove that.
You love your country.
Just as I love mine.
My mother once said that one day,
I would marry a man who played the piano.
Everybody has been wondering what this day would be like.
I haven't.
Never.
I didn't want to experience it.
Why not?
If you don't do it, Andrej, I will tell you something.
War is changing the words.
"Love" is not what it used to be.
And yet,
in spite of that,
I want that my husband finds the same wife that he left behind when he returns.
Please stay.
Us women, we are branded for life.
But for here and now, right in this moment,
I feel fantastic.
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.
And mummy?
Ilse?
Ilse?
Ilse?
Ilse.
Ilse, get away from him.
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.
We went to see Felix.
You could smell the tree resin.
We came across a cloud of butterflies.
And you knew all their names.
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds, Swallowtails and many more.
One was taking a sunbath right there on the path, it was velvety brown and yellow with a blue hem.
You called it a Mourning Cloak.
So many things I've been given in my life.
In abundance.
The Major had lost everything.
Damn Russian idealist.
He takes it all like he wants the world to be.
Soviet apostle.
I like him though.
The less he wants from me, the more I like him.
Very much.
Andrej.
Andrej.
Andrej isn't here any more.
Relocated.
To where?
Unknown.
Good-bye.
"The birds so quiet, the bells are silent."
(from "18 Little Songs of the Bitter Homeland" by Yiannis Ritsos)
Isn't that how it goes?
Please, sit down.
The studio, is that gone?
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.
Ukrainians like that.
Here, that's for you.
You are shameless.
Don't you see that?
It is disgusting just to look at you.
Atten-shun!
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?
That I had the chance to get to know you.
Take care of yourself.
How are we supposed to live?
Eyes front!
"Relocation," that's what they call it.
With full honors and merits.
To Siberia, who knows?
Gerd.
My beloved Gerd.
What shall we do?
Turn back the wheel of time?
Back to your very first words?
"30 minutes", you said.
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will never want to leave me again."
What?
What?
No answer.
Two days later he was gone.
I don't know if he will come back.
I am surprised that I am not suffering more.
Maybe I am just too busy.
I need to find a piece of flint stone,
I need to mop up the floor of the apartment and I am desperately looking for some flowers.
Yesterday I found some lilac.
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.
Who knows?
Maybe our hearts have a say in this, too, and we'll see each other again, some day.
When the diary "A woman in Berlin" was first released in Germany in 1959, it was a huge scandal.
Many people said that it was a disgrace and an insult to the German women.
The author was so shocked by the rejection and the contempt that her book received.
She prohibited any further releases for as long as she lived.
And even beyond her death, here real name was never to be revealed.

Anonyma
A Woman in Berlin
(woman's voice) Who would've thought that?
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin and now they were heading towards the Reichstag.
On this day, you could see the sun behind the clouds, and the smell of lilac wafted through all the smoke.
How to start?
How to find the right words?
I've been a journalist, I've traveled 12 countries.
Been living in Moscow, Paris and London.
I really liked to stay in Paris and London.
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.
My name doesn't matter.
I am one of the many who fervently believed in our country's future.
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.
(Gerd) Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.
The Russians don't have a leader.
When they finally come to their senses, we are already knocking at their front door in Moscow.
Pardon our pushiness, but it's war after all.
Gerd hated railway stations.
When he left, the sound of his boots filled the house.
We were certain to do the right thing, we breathed the same air as everybody else.
We were part of this.
And then he takes off my coat and says:
The Russians have no idea what's coming towards them.
So we were heading towards the Sorbonne and chatting away in French.
He thought that I was one of those tall blond Swedes.
Then I made a double step to match my stride to his.
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.
Hold on.
I...
I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.
I would like for us all to share this moment, this wonderful evening, with our husbands who are stationed somewhere all over Europe.
(Explosions)
Get lost!
Run, run!
Get away!
(woman) Go away!
(officer) Houses on the right.
Fan out.
(honking)
(Soldiers singing)
Come here, damn it!
(child) Mummy, where are you?
Come on.
Hurry.
(Soldier) Away.
Go away.
Open fire, reload grenade.
...and fire!
Fire!
Shit.
- Wait for me.
- Watch out!
Heads down.
- There you are.
- Stop!
Wait for me.
Watch out!
(woman) No!
No uniforms, no weapons, or it's martial law.
(Russian)
(woman) Felix, where are you?
Felix?
- Where the hell is he?
Felix?
- Not a single order.
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.
Felix?
Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?
In Wedding district, they are already showing their toddlers to the Russians.
Russian pigs.
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.
And that's the pharmacist's widow.
Her husband once cured Minister Hindenburg's headache.
That's over.
Now you step on the face and the arms of a dead woman only to get a glass of jelly.
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician.
Her husband is MIA.
(Screaming)
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.
Look at me.
Look at me!
I will write all of this down, I will report it.
Gerd, and you shall read it.
May I offer you something?
Thank you.
From Silesia.
She won't make it.
(Music)
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.
They're coming.
(Russian)
Halt!
(Announcement) Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.
All fire arms have to be turned in immediately.
This is the last warning.
Attention, attention.
This is the last warning.
(Russian)
Attack!
Upstairs!
All the way upstairs!
Go away!
Not now!
Attention!
(Russian)
I...
I have... (whispering in Russian)
Careful!
Comrade Colonel.
The troops have almost reached Potsdam station.
But the order was to go towards the government district!
Understood, Comrade Colonel.
We'll stay here.
Major!
I thought we were going to the Reichstag.
No Reichstag?
But why not, we are so close.
Screw it, we are not staying here!
That's an order!
Retreat!
Secure our flank!
Understood?
Soldiers?
Officers?
Weapons?
I said:
Soldiers?
Officers?
(woman) They will see soon enough.
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.
Get out!
One person at a time.
Get out, all of you!
Move it!
- Russian filth!
- Up!
What... do you want?
Russian?
Yes.
Russian!
Come.
Come.
Eat.
War kaput.
Woman.
Come!
Eat.
War kaput, woman.
Come on.
No fear.
No fear.
We will not die here.
Bravo, come, come.
Don't be afraid.
Come.
Don't shiver!
Good!
Come.
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.
You be nice and you'll get something to eat.
Potatoes.
Very good.
May I?
(soldiers laughing)
(Music)
Does anybody know how this thing works?
You, Ukrainian, do you know it?
There they are, our Russian liberators.
Full of joy.
It seems they can hardly believe that they've made it this far.
I know them, their sandals and villages.
Their rapidly constructed new buildings they are so proud of.
Stop!
They are without any constraints.
Don't move, asshole!
Leave her.
Get lost.
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?
That's enough!
No, seriously...
Your urine is much too old.
Back in Leningrad, I put my general back on his feet with urine...
You storyteller!
It's true.
What are they doing?
Please!
Please!
Have you husband?
A husband and two children.
Come anyway.
Quick, quick!
(woman) Let me through!
Let me through!
No, no, you pigs.
You pigs!
No!
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.
Stop.
- You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
(man) Come on, don't be so prude.
Most fellow countrymen adeptly saved their own hides.
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.
Leave!
Mrs. Hitler.
You slut!
Where to?
To the Fuhrer?
Here.
Quick.
Penthouse to the right.
Quick!
Go!
Take this and go!
Go!
Come.
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.
Soldier!
Why are you taking a woman... who doesn't want you?
Willing women are unclean.
(Door is closed)
Open the door!
Open it!
Open the door, you bastards!
Open it!
(Music)
Not here.
- Where?
- Almost there.
Stop!
Stay where you are!
Hey you.
Shoo shoo!
Commander...
I am looking for the commanding officer.
What's up?
Are you in charge here?
I... we need help.
Are you in charge here?
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.
Which one do you want?
Major, sir...
We need your help...
Our men are all healthy and clean.
(car departs)
Mrs. Hitler.
Our country is finished.
Gerd, do you remember your first words?
"Give me 30 minutes and you will never want to leave me again."
God almighty.
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.
She took me by the hand and just led me inside her undestroyed apartment.
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.
Moving places was easy: a blouse, a few books and notebooks.
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.
(Russians singing)
Take good care of yourself.
In spite of everything, it would have been good to have a closer look around.
But then, we never know everything, so that's how the story continued.
I guess it has been really nice here once.
How did you find me here?
I searched every cellar.
How often?
Often.
The shores are clad in green, the trees are breathing freely and deeply
We bravely stride on and on, towards the final assault in this war!
Our path was long to reach this day in May.
It has cost us much strength and courage.
But now we are free again!
We proudly take our positions.
Greetings, May.
Our soldiers and a few American weapons, and those would be history.
Yeah.
(Russians cheering)
Yesterday at the water pump, it was my turn, a guy approaches me,
two Iron Crosses and one German Cross in Gold on his chest, and he gallantly takes the buckets out of my hands.
And I say:
"How do I deserve this honor?" and he says "We can't give up now"
"because if the Russian even remotely does to us
"what we did to them during the last four years,
"in the near future there won't be any living Germans left."
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin!
We made it!
How do you say:
Excuse me, do you have a dictionary?
I guess he doesn't need a dictionary for what he wants.
(banging)
Lenchen!
(unintelligible)
Come with us!
Come where?
Lenchen!
During the next few days, our house was raided day and night.
Lenchen!
One woman hanged herself, another one was shot to death.
None of us was spared.
Every emotion is dead.
Hey, you from Berlin!
Over here!
Upstairs.
What kept you so long?
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.
Forever!
Lenchen.
- What have you got there?
- A map.
Move it!
Faster.
You go left, I go right.
Where are you going?
Come to us.
Come.
Wake up, damned of the earth, who are living in hunger and misery.
Justice is about to burst through like glowing magma in a volcano.
You just go away, away!
I!
I love you.
Good day.
Please, don't!
My pretty one.
I'll be back.
My pretty one...
I am a young man...
You scared me.
(Music)
We will survive all this,
by any means necessary.
Where to?
We're here.
Who are you looking for?
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.
So where are they now, our saviors, all the great armies?
In the past, war and dying was a male exclusive thing.
But those times are long gone.
Damned Russians.
Officer, General, Commander, doesn't matter.
I take everyone, as high in rank as possible.
From now on, I will decide who gets me.
No, no.
Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.
You can protect us from over there on the couch, see?
Protect.
Hm?
See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.
Do you understand?
(Russian)
Where is the Major?
Wait.
Hey, Miss.
Who are you looking for?
You, blondie.
Why are you looking so stern?
You!
Could you soap my back, huh?
Who do you want to talk to?
You.
Dismissed.
May I have a seat?
No.
Yesterday our house has been occupied and many women have been raped.
I know nothing of that.
It is your duty to help us.
Who?
My people or yours?
Me.
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.
(Unintelligible)
It's pointless.
You Russian?
Looking what?
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.
Lieutenant, sir.
May I have a word?
Some of the balconies in our house are mined.
Could you help?
Pity.
Miss!
You, I, evening?
Hm?
I Anatol.
You, I, simple as that, huh?
At this moment I made a vow, that nothing and nobody would touch me, no matter what happened.
Come in.
Follow.
That's where I live.
Come on in.
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.
Well...
That's my husband.
Don't you understand?
My husband.
You must understand that.
All humans are bad.
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.
What are doing?
That is mahogany.
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.
To the 215th Rifles!
To victory!
To us.
I Charkov!
He's from Charkov.
Charkov!
Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.
An accountant?
You're kidding me.
I accountant!
You accountant!
We accountant!
Everything fine.
That's life, you see?
You, pretty.
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.
The fucking war is really pissing me off.
True.
When I get back to Charkov,
I'll marry, build a house, get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.
and you, I will take you as my accountant.
Are you a professional soldier?
No...
I, dairy.
Milk!
Milk.
Cow.
- How very interesting.
- Interesting!
Milk and milk.
That's bullshit.
Look at this.
My trophies.
That's nothing.
Here.
THAT is a trophy.
That's not a trophy.
Have a look at this.
That that is a REAL trophy.
An original.
My present to all the ladies.
To kiss and marvel about.
Where toilet?
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.
Would you like something to eat?
You.
(Baby screaming)
You fancy my dick?
Doesn't matter which one.
Dick is dick.
Why Russia?
What were you doing there, you sons of a bitch?
Why Russia?
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.
He is battalion commander.
They don't have commandants, only commanders.
(widow) Did you know that they study German as first foreign language?
Well, it needs a war for us to get this bit of information.
Can I do something for you?
(door slamming)
Hey Mongol.
Have you come all the way from Moscow just to get some water for a German woman?
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?
Made in Germany...
I am taking care of the Major.
Go now.
I'll catch up later.
Go.
Go, Mongol, go!
Move it.
Faster!
Go, go, go!
Move it already.
Faster.
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors and the whole house was rubble.
And it blasted the fattened sow up till under the roof.
Well, obviously it was spoiled.
Here.
Give it to me.
My apologies... for my unsuitable behavior.
Dismissed.
(Music)
Berlin is ours.
There.
I have told everybody that they needed to go.
May I sit down?
Come here.
As you wish.
No?
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.
In every apartment.
We are Russian property now.
At their service.
But us women, we will need to keep our mouths shut, or no man will ever want to touch us again when this is all over.
Poor Germany.
German fighters: sit!
Four.
Four women.
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.
Here.
That's what I've found.
They've got everything.
They've got jewelry and money and houses.
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.
Enough.
What do I care about them?
Sometimes I think that from now on I could endure everything imaginable, as long as it comes from the outside and not from deep within my treacherous heart.
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.
A welcome committee.
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.
Anatol is a gypsy.
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.
My sun.
Do you think...
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?
No.
Never.
Here.
Is that all?
My head is aching like crazy.
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.
If that's the last thing I'll do in my life.
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.
Fuck the Reichstag.
Then he grabs me and throws me on the bed.
And suddenly, he gets so boring, like a lapdog.
Later, he complimented me.
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this."
"You, like this."
He had really bad breath.
(banging)
- Oh.
It's you.
- Good morning.
We bring breakfast.
The next morning, a few blocks away the war was still raging,
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.
The widow, who loved bacon, was busy as a bee.
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard, was all too happy to surrender.
This way.
- Russian horse.
- What's that?
Sugar.
We have sugar!
And bacon and salami and bread and butter.
Great joy, but not for everybody.
Then came the cavalry.
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead, horses snuffling.
When a horse is charging, that's an incredible force.
The whole avalanche is charging against the tank, against the artillery, against all the machine guns -
All kaput.
You've had much more troops, but they just couldn't stand it.
They dropped their weapons and fled.
German soldiers, bah!
Don't be so insensitive.
We didn't start this war!
Sit down.
And stop insulting our host.
Enough.
I Caucasus.
Caucasus, understand?
Big mountain, so beautiful!
Sun, blue sky.
Nice dancing with women.
As sweet as grapes.
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.
Pushkin?
Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.
Go home, understand?
I want to see my children and my wife.
(Singing)
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin."
I want my wife.
My wife.
Understand?
What do you know about fascism?
Fascism?
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a "bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.
To our host.
Right.
To a woman who is quite obviously very bright.
Just like you right now.
Very bright.
But I am not a woman!
To German-Russian friendship!
Hurray!
Everybody upstairs, quick!
Hurry!
Quick!
Search all the apartments.
Out.
Out!
You goddamn bastard!
You dick!
You fucking dick!
Stop it.
Enough!
You know Stalin's orders.
Get lost.
Really?
What if I don't?
Are you gonna shoot me?
I'll kill you if I have to.
He is acting on my orders.
Stop!
A young soldier has stolen food.
He is armed.
Who is living up there?
Who is living there?
Anybody living there?
No.
She's lying.
Lying bitch.
I spit on Germany.
And on Berlin.
We conquered it, and I spit on it!
Get out of my way.
Don't move.
(screaming)
I'll kill you, punk!
Everyone in possession of fire arms or hiding someone with guns will be executed immediately, their houses destroyed.
(footsteps)
They will not forget this.
Can I have something to drink?
(Russian)
(door opening)
You need to get away from here.
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.
(Mongol singing)
During the next few days, the Major was here often.
Great protection for everyone.
In his coat he had tucked away candles and cigars and plenty of gifts that the widow stashed away in her kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.
On the whole, the times were changing.
(Russian)
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?
That is way too much.
The major speaks sophisticated Russian and told me more than I wanted to know.
Now I know about his bank account, his parents and the names of his brothers.
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.
(Russian)
The war continued.
While our men and husbands were sent to Siberia, many of the women found protectors which made them a taboo for the rest of the pack.
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.
Almost there.
Hold it up.
Up.
In and out, in and out.
It's like Grand Central Station in here.
Mussolini is dead.
Hanged.
He deserved it.
One asshole less.
Cheers!
As soon as Andrej had left the house, Anatol claimed his visiting rights.
I was afraid that the two top dogs would meet and kill me one day.
It's not that I could claim that this Major is raping me.
I am at his service.
A whore?
Maybe.
(snoring)
I have met that kind of woman only once in my life.
People told me not to talk to her because she was unsound.
Whatever that means: unsound.
Young woman!
No way.
Incredible.
There she comes prancing along as if nothing happened.
- How often?
- Four times.
You?
Come on.
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.
So do you.
Here.
Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux.
Take it.
You take that with you.
Seems you are having a good life here.
That's one way to put it.
Come on.
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.
The Major is guarding us well so that we can drink his tea without any disturbances.
That feels so good.
Where to?
What do you care?
You can't go in there.
Who's in there?
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.
So I tell him:"Young man,
"that gun there over your shoulder, that might go off."
And when I go up the stairs, on the second floor someone rushes out of the apartment, grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"
And I am in shock and I say:
- "No, surely not."
- How dumb of you.
How's your husband?
He was there when it happened the first time.
He's been a bit confused ever since.
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.
They are pretty unimaginative.
It may be that at home, they have the latest and greatest socialist planned economy, ...but their sex life is that of Adam and Eve.
That's what I told my husband, too.
With all the food shortage, a good husband isn't worth that much.
I guess a satisfactory sex life depends on regular meals.
For me, it's all about a full stomach.
No gifts, no sex!
Heart, Pain, Love, Sex Drive.
To us!
Who knows when we'll be together again.
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!
That is apple streusel cake.
Yeah, with crumbles, and it's still steaming hot.
(Singing) # You, you are in my heart. #
# You, you are on my mind. #
# You, you cause me great pains, # # you don't know how much I love you. #
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
# don't know how much I love you. #
Not too much going on with our Russian men right now, am I right?
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.
Have you heard anything from Gerd?
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.
Oh my God.
How do you know you've got it?
(Book seller) Itching and burning.
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.
I've read it in a lexicon.
A lexicon...
Here.
An American gave that to me.
Chew it.
Good, isn't it?
Americans...
They all look like film stars.
I'm leaving.
And tell her... that I'll be back.
You got that?
What's that?
Can you protect us?
Just this one day?
I'll be here.
Where will you go...
later?
To where I am needed.
A special evening with the Major.
Good conversation.
He told me that he adores me.
And that he doesn't care about anything else.
Other than the Germans, the Russian men really appreciate educated women.
But the war hasn't ended yet.
Excuse me.
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.
Come on, kiddos, let's get out of here.
We will finish building this tower of yours.
That's him.
Good day.
You Russian?
Translate.
The German army came to my village
and killed all the children.
They have stabbed them to death,
took their bodies at the ankles...
Continue!
...and smashed their skulls on the walls of the houses.
Have you heard that?
Or did you see it with your own eyes?
I saw it.
Hey!
Why so fast?
Have you forgotten your panties?
(Russian)
(woman) You speak Russian, so tell him he needs to stop that.
You speak Russian, right?
Move it, you slut!
Go.
(Music)
(Russian)
Where are you going?
I've been waiting for you.
What's wrong with you?
Comrade Major!
The old Germany is coming to an end.
Stay away from him!
He is coming to me, not the other way round.
Go away.
Why?
You Germans have hanged his wife.
(Music)
(Announcement) Attention!
On April 30th, 1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.
He deserted all of us who have pledged allegiance to him.
Following the orders of the Fuhrer, you still believe it's your duty to defend Berlin although the supply of heavy armory, ammunition and your position make this fight utterly pointless.
With every hour you continue to fight, you prolong the horrible suffering of the civil population of Berlin... and our wounded soldiers.
From now on, everybody who dies in the battle for Berlin will have sacrificed their lives in vain.
In accordance with the leaders of the Soviet army I prompt you to cease all fighting immediately.
Breitling, Artillery General and commanding officer of the Berlin defense.
Fellow soldiers and officers of the 8th guard army.
This morning, the Berlin garrison has capitulated.
Berlin... is defeated.
I've told you we would make it!
(Russian national anthem)
(Undiscernible)
(Soldiers singing the Russian national anthem)
I'll join my fellow Germans.
Go to Siberia?
What about us?
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!
Talk to me.
I've been waiting for you.
I have prayed and hoped, prayed and hoped.
No I want you to fulfill some of those hopes for me.
(cheering)
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!
Berlin is defeated!
To our home country!
Long live the Red Army!
Long live Stalin!
(Lieutenant) Hold on, wait a second.
What have we here?
Two halibuts.
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.
That's great!
Let's drink.
(piano music)
Capitulation.
The time has come.
The war is over.
Us women have been looking forward to this day so much.
So how does it feel?
Bitter, bitter defeat.
More and more people report gruesome things.
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp something in the air, mean and threatening.
I don't want to think about that right now.
(Russian)
It's over.
I don't know...
I'm afraid misfortune has still some tricks up its sleeves.
(Russian)
Do you hear that?
They drink and smoke like men.
There are 1 million women in the Russian army.
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.
Once a woman came to me, Ljuba was her name I think.
She says: "Comrade Major, I believe I will fall today.
"I want new clothes." I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.
"Bullets just avoid you." Two hours later, she comes again.
And again.
Then I tell her:
"Then the new shirt, with ties white as snow, it would be spoiled by the blood."
All female soldiers fear that when they die, they don't look pretty.
Are you a fascist?
What are you looking for?
All occupied.
And the battalion commander?
That's what I like about you Mongols.
Not a single unnecessary word.
1678 days... since I've been in this war.
And now...
And she... she's a whore.
Am I right?
This whole place... is a brothel!
(door opening)
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.
A pistol, huh?
Bastard!
Peace, huh?
Don't!
War kaput!
I said, move it!
Everybody downstairs.
Hurry!
All of you, downstairs.
Hurry!
Faster.
Quick!
Don't move.
Where you get weapons?
Whose apartment is that?
Who?
It's mine.
Is that hers?
It's hers.
That is crime against decree of Red Army.
Long live the Fuhrer.
Eliminate her.
You can all go to hell.
Did you know about weapons?
- No.
- Go back to apartment.
Shoot them all!
Go now.
Stop.
They're liars, all of them!
Shoot them.
Leave this woman.
She is a Hitler broad.
Do you understand?
No.
First she will be interrogated.
Do you understand?
What are you doing, brother?
This woman has sheltered an armed soldier.
The punishment for that is death.
Go, now!
I'll have to report this.
Burn them alive!
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.
(Russian)
Traitor!
I own whole Berlin!
Hotel Adlon, Wedding, Kaiserdamm!
Red flags everywhere.
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.
What is it?
Quarrel?
What are you looking at?
Get out of my sight.
Hey, what's up?
To victory, Commander.
To Stalin and our victory.
Wait.
You should stay with your people.
The war is over.
Here!
I get it.
Look...
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.
They love me, all of them.
Everything all right?
Do you want something to eat?
Here.
What's better?
You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?
And you, get out of here... before I shoot your nuts off!
You, listen!
We celebrate.
Everybody come, whole house.
Order!
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.
Not human.
Turd!
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!
(Andrey) Everyone, come now.
Order!
Fill the glasses.
What are you standing there?
We've got guests.
Why fear?
(Music)
Look down there.
What do you see?
Soldiers.
Russians!
Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.
And you're right.
None of us is hesitating a single second if we can shoot a German.
Your blood is on our uniforms.
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!
Most of them didn't even know what that is, Germany.
Now come with me.
What is happening here?
Careful, that's mahogany.
Let me go!
(Russian)
- You dance.
Dance!
- How dare you?
This is my living room and not a dance hall.
You understand?
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.
You.
Sing?
Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.
No.
What does that mean, "no"?
That is Europe!
That is Europe!
Drink, drink.
Why not?
I'm looking at you.
And you?
Nothing.
Well, maybe next time.
To you.
I Anatol.
- I know.
- Bärbel.
My heart calls Bärbel.
Bärbel, Bärbel, Bärbel.
(Music)
I play the fiddle.
Violin.
Violin?
You play the piano?
In an orchestra, but not any more.
The violin is lost.
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.
Why don't you go upstairs?
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.
We all need that.
Do you come with me?
Later.
- Sure?
- Yes.
It's good that you are here.
(undiscernible)
I want to embrace you my whole life.
I am here, you're in Moscow.
Nobody has arms that long.
Try it.
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.
"The war is over." He looked at me for a long while.
"Every newborn child cries for war," he said.
Nothing and nobody, no man, no nation, will stop this vicious circle.
Only death.
Not so fast, I am getting sick.
Gee.
Attention.
And now for everybody...
"I in love with you."
Bärbel.
(Music)
(humming)
Dance.
Come on, let's go.
We are not a people any more, we're only "the population".
I am talking about individuals that form within a democracy.
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.
Dance, dance, you come.
I think we should look at the greater picture here.
The countries of Europe will burst their borders.
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will, just like Napoleon did, re-order the political world map.
So we will become a Soviet republic with planned economy, huh?
Thanks.
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.
Let's start the every day life again, and we will soon get into the groove.
Slow down.
Drink.
The Soviet Union is just at the beginning of its evolution.
The future will prove that.
You love your country.
Just as I love mine.
My mother once said that one day,
I would marry a man who played the piano.
Everybody has been wondering what this day would be like.
I haven't.
Never.
I didn't want to experience it.
Why not?
If you don't do it, Andrej, I will tell you something.
War is changing the words.
"Love" is not what it used to be.
And yet,
in spite of that,
I want that my husband finds the same wife that he left behind when he returns.
Please stay.
(Music)
Us women, we are branded for life.
But for here and now, right in this moment,
I feel fantastic.
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.
(door opening)
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.
And mummy?
Ilse?
Ilse?
Ilse?
(Ilse crying)
Ilse.
Ilse, get away from him.
(Screaming)
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.
We went to see Felix.
You could smell the tree resin.
We came across a cloud of butterflies.
And you knew all their names.
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds, Swallowtails and many more.
One was taking a sunbath right there on the path, it was velvety brown and yellow with a blue hem.
You called it a Mourning Cloak.
(Music)
So many things I've been given in my life.
In abundance.
The Major had lost everything.
Damn Russian idealist.
He takes it all like he wants the world to be.
Soviet apostle.
I like him though.
The less he wants from me, the more I like him.
Very much.
Andrej.
Andrej.
Andrej isn't here any more.
Relocated.
To where?
Unknown.
Good-bye.
"The birds so quiet, the bells are silent."
(from "18 Little Songs of the Bitter Homeland" by Yiannis Ritsos)
Isn't that how it goes?
Please, sit down.
The studio, is that gone?
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.
Ukrainians like that.
Here, that's for you.
You are shameless.
Don't you see that?
It is disgusting just to look at you.
(Music)
(Music)
Atten-shun!
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?
That I had the chance to get to know you.
Take care of yourself.
How are we supposed to live?
Eyes front!
"Relocation," that's what they call it.
With full honors and merits.
To Siberia, who knows?
Gerd.
My beloved Gerd.
What shall we do?
Turn back the wheel of time?
Back to your very first words?
"30 minutes", you said.
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will never want to leave me again."
(Music)
(Music)
What?
What?
No answer.
Two days later he was gone.
I don't know if he will come back.
I am surprised that I am not suffering more.
Maybe I am just too busy.
I need to find a piece of flint stone,
I need to mop up the floor of the apartment and I am desperately looking for some flowers.
Yesterday I found some lilac.
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.
Who knows?
Maybe our hearts have a say in this, too, and we'll see each other again, some day.
(Music)
When the diary "A woman in Berlin" was first released in Germany in 1959, it was a huge scandal.
Many people said that it was a disgrace and an insult to the German women.
The author was so shocked by the rejection and the contempt that her book received.
She prohibited any further releases for as long as she lived.
And even beyond her death, here real name was never to be revealed.

HITLER IS KAPUT
As the Second World War ended, aninformant used by the SS toldtheReichMainSecurityOffice that the execution of Rabinovich, aJewconsideredtoo lucky by the Nazis, was the only hope of the Reich.
Listen, occupant comrades!
This must be a mistake.
I've only played the harpsichord with the fascist-supporting orchestra.
I never hurt a single Nazi.
Even in thought.
I'm allergic to metal and I have asthma.
I am suffering from chronic gastritis and diabetes.
My doctor has forbidden me to participate in any executions.
Fellow comrades, do not kill me, it is Shabbat.
Attention.
Load.
Fire!
ShurenbergpesteredHQ for a meeting with Hitler.
TheFürher,achronicdepressive, hada taste for unnecessary meetings.
"ThankGodit 'sFriday!",the great Russian spy said to himself.
Run,Rabinovich,run!

- Have you been drinking?
- No!
I had to put the pedal to the metal to arrive on time.
I sympathise, man.
Müller?
I'll pay you back on Monday.
Addy, is this a good idea?
- It's for my ill health.
- I'm sure...
"Auf Wiedersehen."
Tuck back that belly.

Aleksandr Isaevich.
So, how are you?
How is work going?
I don't particularly want to talk about it.
- What is it?
- I'm sick and tired of it.
Tired of all these stories of espionage.
I am homesick.
I see.
Keep holding on, you're a superhero responsible for protecting the nation's oil.
You should relax, my boy.
I left you something in the fridge, it will please you.
You're a real pal.
What would I do without you?

We must admit it.
The Russians are pros.
It seems someone has done their homework.
Everything is in order.
He starts to annoy me.
I'm sure he's a spy.
This accusation, is it based on evidence?
Not yet, but it will come.
Then put it on hold, or you will suffer constipation from the incredibly stiff stick up your arse.

- Shurenberg.
- A quick game?
- No funny business this time.
That's low.
The light falls only on the board.
- Yes?
- Yes.
- Such a move, really?
- You are very insolent.
Take this.
Don't count your chickens before they are hatched...
The bald make bad players.
- Shall we cut to brass tacks?
- Have you been promoted?
Quite to the contrary.
And I need cash.
Looking at you, Shurenberg, I say:
"That's a Nazi as he should be."
A bright boy, effective and loyal to the Reich.
But sometimes, I ...
Yes, occasionally I look at you and I think, without wanting to offend you, there's a good face of a slave.
You think it's fun to see your boobs move like a flan?
Front, back!
Front, back!
I want to go home!
To Mom's!
Drink a glass of vodka, the nice Soviet type.
Embrace who I am and spend my holidays in Turkey dancing.
But I am the in the Third Reich among morons!
Shurenbergnearly blew his cover.
Checkmate.
Better luck next time.
So dirty occupants is it party time or what?

Aww hell no!
Kuzmich, please, close the fridge door.
I'm tired of having to defrost it all the time.

SHE'SSINGLE
Hello, I'm Zina, your decryptor.
Sasha Osechkin, spy.
A beautiful landing.
Enchanted.
Likewise.
Zina ...
Such a lovely name.
- And quite rare.
- You are spiritual.
- You are cute.
- You're extraordinary.
We have only just met.
How can you judge?
I have this hunch.
I'm not sugar but I'll melt.
- Have I seen you somewhere before?
- Certainly on the net.
I must warn the central;
they could be worried.
I'll take this opportunity to update my Facebook status!
Err, perhaps you'd better not.
He has a way to go.
Can I take you to the safe house?
How do you travel?
I travel by ski and I love to ATV.
And you?
Ice skates.
- Will these rollers do the trick?
- No, but we will do with.
No more secret code on our the rendezvous.
- Can we at least still use the roller skates?
- Let's spy and then we'll talk.
"Heil Hitler."
Ironman Hans von Eisen.
It's been a while, How are you?
As usual.
The kids who whine, the death rattle of the bourgeois, a lazy wife ...
Finally, a happy life.
I see.
But I would not be bothered personal problems.
I charge 300 Reichsmark an hour for family therapy.
Something of a hobby.
But let's talk business.
Here, take a look at this.
I'm sure Shurenberg is a Soviet spy.
But, Gruppenführer, we've tried radio tapping.
It is useless.
I would have less trouble getting pregnant.
Why would you do that?
You'd be tired, whimsical, ill.
Search the world over.
We must find out if he is.
Think about it.
Put a contract on his head.
At the expense of the taxpayer?
Do something:
threat, questioning ...
Rape with foreign objects.
The old methods!
How you doin' nigga?
Where you goin'?
You got the rhythm in the blood, my brother!

I have decided to stay here in Berlin to enjoy the victories and advances our great reich!
I will review my plans.
There are too many successes for a leader!
So many so that I could burst!
Und das ist Hitler!
And they, our friendly soldiers!
Them, the Russians pigs!
No, help, leave me alone!
Is that clear?
I told you all that with heart on hand our soldiers can be proud of their work across the Reich.
They will come back full of medals on the torso, and stories in the head.
They are the vectors of our triumph, their hands stained with the enemy's blood, with the desire to suck the udders of the nation.
Blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg!
Shurenberg!
To the table!
This does not interest you?
- Not at all, "mein Führer!"
- Not at all it does, or not at all it doesn't?
It does, "mein Führer!"
Then repeat what I said, "bitte".
- Absolutely everything?
- From A to Z.
Some nerve, eh?
Allthoseyearsoftraining would be used for something.
I enjoy advances our reich.
These are successes too one officer must ensure!
I tell you the heart to the hand!
That is Hitler.
And they, our friendly soldiers.
Yes, yes ...
And they, the Russian soldiers.
This is wonderful!
Is that clear?
TheGestapolaunchedaninvitationfortenders for a secret weapon.
TheKremlinaskedShurenberg to keep an eye on the project.
- "Heil Hitler."
- Enough, Shurenberg.
At a time when the Allies progress in our country, you scuttle around like a ballerina.
But I think only of the victory of our Reich.
Please, anything but that.
The shot of patriotism ...
Stop being the problem child at work, you hear?
.
I have a mission for you.
MISSION OF THE DAY:
DEATH RAY LASER
The secret weapon we wanted.
You will make me a business plan.
30% increase in the budget, half under the table.
No bullshit, Shurenberg.
Do your homework.
No stains on your notebook.
Or on the bed sheets.
I want a good note.
It's out of the question to defecate on the flowers!
It messes up the buds.
Is that clear?
Questions?
- I can't grope girls?
- It is a distraction.
This mission is the last hope of the Reich.
We do not fiddle with the babes.
I appreciate the confidence you bear me.
I will not disappoint you even if I can not fiddle.
Sometimes I just feel like jumping.
All is well.
This is the third time today.

With it, victory is assured.

Professor, would you describe yourself as loyal to the Reich?
Standartenführer ...
I'm a businessman.
Talk to your superiors.
They make a better offer, I take the money.
And you get a commission.
Let's go.
We can talk here.
It is a safe place.
If I tell you something, you won't denounce me,
- will you?
- No.
In fact, I can not stand the Nazis.
Thankyouforyoursincerity.

And fatherland fries.
And fatherland fries!
(unintelligible)
- It'll be ready in a minute.
- I'm not deaf.
This is where I spy discreetly.
I eat like a pig.
I love it.
A girl who has an appetite, this is rare.
I've always felt like a pregnant woman.
I come from a region that has experienced famine.
I can not help it.
I see food, and I can not resist.
I throw myself upon it.
I had a weird childhood too.
When I was angry against someone,
I used to secrete a poisonous saliva.
- You're kidding me.
- My mother used me to kill flies.
- Stop it!
- This is the truth!
When I am with you, I feel ... in my place.
Oi!
You, with the remote control.
We can embrace quietly?
ZINA, YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY!
Stop!
Halt!
Stop!
I know a very fun game they play around the corner.
What do you say?
Okay...
What kind of game?
"Can you recognise it blind? "
- What, not up for it?
- Me?

YALTA CONFERENCE, FEB 1945
Where is my tobacco?
And now, my dear Shurenberg,
We loved the Reich and now...
Yes.
The situation is far from rosy.
"Far from rosy." A very appropriate expression.
A simple expression, but appropriate.
I like you a lot.
I mean, I really like you.
You too, I mean, err, Obergruppenführer...
- ...
I think you're a good person.
- Thank you.
You look so inspired, so intelligent and brave ...
- That's nice.
- Your smile is bedazzling.
- Thank you, Obergruppenführer.
- Believe me,
I'd bet you know, in the true sense, how to satisfy a man.
- I'd rather not.
- Love is blind.
- I still have my eyes.
- A pitty.
You should let go, forget everything, and take the leap.
Take the plunge and jump in to the water like a 14 year-old virgin jugend.

What are you playing at, Nazi bitch?
Come on, say it.
Come out with it!
Forget it.
It's not in my horoscope today, nor yours.

- Have we been drinking, perhaps?
- Forget it,

- Please step out of the vehicle.

Sometimes I think about us.
We live in a foreign country, among these fascists.
So far from our dear Russia.
But you're here, to play spies with me.
What would I do without you?
Once back in Moscow what will happen?
Tramps will throw themselves at you.
What are you saying?
They will.
And you will succumb, you'll see.

GESTAPO HILLS
Only a seasoned spy as Shurenberg couldkeephiswitsabouthimas
IronHansvonEisen continued to watchhimclosely.
Allthatremainedamystery were his intentions.
Hans, buddy, What brings you here?
Shurenberg.
Sorry to arrive unannounced.
The Gestapo banned texting.
I know.
We'll talk about it at the union meeting.
Can I get you anything?
- A tea?
- Green Tea.
Without caffeine.
What was this weird music that I heard?
Nothing like I've heard before.
It was a bit of trance CMS Nazi techno.
"Tai-pin-ho-ku" Chinese exclusive import.
Shurenberg, you are aware there are people in the Gestapo who believe that you are a Soviet spy.
Do you want sugar?
No, but I'll take my tea on a saucer.
- You know, so I don't spill.
- Right.
Moving on, trying to find evidence against you, is like opening champagne with your buttocks.
It's new and it hurts just thinking.
Suffice to say, it is impossible.
- Milk?
- Semi-skimmed.
Thank you.
It goes without saying.
Do not get me wrong, but I was ordered yesterday by Müller to peruse your file.
I'll have to ask you a few questions.
Fine.
Let's begin.
Have you faxed our plans to Stalin?
This is a routine questionnaire.
Wait.
I left my fingerprints on the fax?
No no.
Continuing.
I'll ask the next question.
Question.
Will they come out with another "Matrix" movie or not?
Hans, it's a trilogy.
It was a trick question.
You fell into our trap.
We heard your conversation with engineer Garik.
Interesting.
So he escapes to Moscow?
He thinks we suck, is that it?
You know?
Wait!
That's in my file?
Leave it at that.
Otherwise I will hurt you.
The more Shurenberg felt anger come over him, the more poison filled his mouth.
I warned you, stupid Iron Man.
My darling, what are you doing?
Come to bed.
Without you, I can not sleep.
I'm coming, sweetheart.
I have to work late.
- I'll be right there.
- Hurry up.
Not too loud, huh?
Otherwise we will awake Zina.
THE ASHES OF IRON HANS VON EISEN
RETURN HOME, DIRTY COMMUNIST!
Hidden deep in suburban Berlin wasthesafe house of the Red Army.
Nobodycoulddistinguish it from the other apartments.
"Heil", Machin.
A and B are on a boat.
A fall in the water and B disappears.
- Who are you then?
Tell me!
- NKVD.
Perhaps.
Come in.
My cover will soon be blown.
My contract mentions the words "force majeure"
so I came to see you.
I see, yes.
Being unmasked is unpleasant.
Humiliation, interrogation, tweezers, curlers.
- Curlers?
- The permanent ass hair.
- Have you been tortured?
- Huh?
No, it's just Chianti.
I partied yesterday.
With some metal workers.
True saints.
Well, let's get your equipment.
This is a beautiful sofa I love the decor.
I live alone.
I spend my hours masturbating.
Well, let's see.
What have we here?
So ...
Cyanide
Valium, gags, handcuffs, range, slip alternative crosswords, leather whip and obviously, pear enema.
In other words, basic survival kit.
- But what about the ...
- "Niet."
No tickets for the Moscow Midget Circus.
Speaking of circus you see that briefcase there?
It's for you.
Engineer Garik asked me to give it to you.
He arrived in Moscow and is doing well.
He opened a casino.
Clients from the Kremlin down to the workers at the local kebab.
Russian resistance.
What can I do for you?
No, we do not do home delivery before 7 o'-clock.
Yourduesas promised.
10% commission.
MOTHER RUSSIA
NEUTRAL GROUND
TO THE REICH
For you, comrade, the right door.
MOTHER RUSSIA
I want to go East, you can not imagine how badly.
Listen,
I'll get Zina and we'll all take the door.
Zina was arrested at dawn.
Gestapo torture for three hours.
It must be in the process of braking her soul.
I would suggest trying to release her, but the orders are clear:
return home to Russia.
Sorry, man.
I can not.
Be reasonable.
Return home.
You do not need Zina.
One can very easily live without a woman.
I give you my couch.
It's yours.
Sorry.
A hero has obligations.
Who is your contact?
Never.
Who is your contact?
Shurenberg!
I am delighted to see you here, Herr Clever-Boy.
At the mall we stopped a Russian radio operator.
Do you know her?
- Who is your contact?
- Never.
Trynotto cry.
Why would I know her?
What's wrong?
I think I caught a cold.
I'm dizzy.
Get well soon!
ShurenbergimaginedZina at the shopping mall.
He sympathised with the pain of his dearest.
Againstthewall!
Come on, hurry!
Dropyourweapons!

- Sasha
- Zina
Comeon,babes!
Yes.
Yes.
Passionatelysigned,Borman.
Order:
Transfer the attendant
custody Standartenführer SS Shurenberg.
Signed, Herr Borman.
And you wore it?
A Gucci?
Are you kidding?
Hugo Boss is far more dashing.
I'll call you later.
- Admit it.
Who is your hairdresser?
- Never!
- "Heil Hitler." - "Heil."
Frau Otto, new orders.
I will try to get something out of the peasant.
PAIN, INJURY, EMERGENCY EXIT
Where is Shurenberg, that son of a *****
I'll **** him from behind!
And when I'm finished, I will not hesitate to rip your *** open and I'll **** in it!
50 Shilling.
50 Shilling, let's do this shit, yeah?
Why don't we go to Chile, in the spring?
No!
All the Gestapo go.
I get tired of seeing the same losers.
So start holidaying in Dubai.
It is expensive.
And I drowning at work.
Who will take care of the Reich in my absence?
There has to be someone for the job.
There is more to life.
- Eva, do not blame me.
- Blame you?
Well, I'll talk to Müller.
He'll perhaps have time for me.
Forgive me.
I have a lot of trouble because of all the stress.
You have your makeup bag?
Of course.
What would I do without it?
You're crazy ...
It was you who took my nightie?
What nightie?
My Dolce Gabbana leopard skin nightie.
You crazy?
I spent the day trying to save you!
Okay?
Do not talk to me like that!
Sorry, kitten, I am a little on my nerves today.
Anyway, this makeup kit?
Taxi!
- How much to take us to the frontier?
- 80 euros.
- It's just 20 minutes!
- Go on foot.
If you don't like it you can ride in the back of a pickup like the other illegals.
For the front?
Dirty crook!
Idiot!
What are you waiting for?
Hit the gas!
We're here.
Just a minute, boss.
Let me catch my breath, for once.

I was so happy I invented butter...

- Yes...
I became rich
Then I left and never came back... and your bike?
Does it still run?
No, it got a flat again, and I never fixed it.
There's one left.

What happened to her?
I found her crying on the street.
What happened to you?
Did someone hit you?
What happened to you?
Come on, tell me.
Do you want us to go home?
Shall we go home?
Teacher!
Teacher, I'm going home
Come on, come on...
Do what you want.
All I'm saying is: you only have a few days left before the fight...
Tomorrow I'll train double!
Give me the gloves, sweety.
$3,000...
$4,600...
Should I give you the $100?
- What?
- Should I give you the $100?
There's not enough change.
What is happening?
Some change is missing.
- How much did he give you?
- $10,000.
I'm sorry...
Thanks.
$50,000 pesos are missing.
One of you must know what happened, right?
Was it you?
No.
And you?
Ok, what's going on here?
It wasn't me.
What?
It wasn't me.
Ok, then who was it?
I don't know.
One of you will have to answer for this.
There is always something with the cash register, either you make mistakes with the change, or some coins are missing.
Now, with the missing amount,
I don't know what to think.
You tell me.
These are once a day.
In the morning or at night?
In the morning, with breakfast.
Tomorrow the doctor wants to talk to you.
Thanks.
- How did it go?
- Fine.
That's good.
Do you know where Toro lives?
Yes, why?
He can give you a job.
He needs someone to clean and look after the house.
I don't know him.
Talk to him.
You have nothing to lose.
A job is a job, right?
Yes, but... as a maid?
Think about it.
Hand me a bucket...
There, around the corner.
When do you want to start?
Whenever you want.
What?
Whenever you want.
Ok, but... you have to tell me when you can start.
I don't know.
When it's not a problem.
What?
I said, when it's not a problem.
How about tomorrow?
.
But look, you're all wet.
No, I'm fine like this.
Don't you want to go to the bathroom, and dry up?

Come
No thanks.
Thanks.
- I'm leaving.
- If you wait I'll take you home.
- No thanks.

He went to the mainland, but will return tonight.
Can I help you with something?
Are you ok?
No, thanks.
I have to go.
Thanks for the help.
Next Monday we'll give her another dose.
Any problem, you call me.
And you?
Weren't you upset?
Have you known Toro for a long time?
Why?
I'm not interested in knowing people well.
In the end I always get bored.
Ana!
It's cold.
Come.
Stay with me, Ana.
Just for a while, stay with me.
Do you have the time?
I have to make a call.

The war between the Spiral races and the Anti-Spiral.
This was the root cause of everything. ...they send the moon plummeting towards the Earth.
It was Simon and his fellow Team Gurren members who triggered this calamity.
Will their struggle for freedom lead to mankind's downfall?
Simon is shackled by the handcuffs of despair.
354)}Episode 19:
By Any Means Necessary
-Give us Simon!
-Make him pay for what he did!
He was never a hero!
Simon is the cause of all this!
It's his fault that the moon is falling!
Rossiu.
Tell me why.
The citizens who were evacuated to the Parliament Tower have begun to riot.
Our defeat of Lord Genome is what set this catastrophe in motion.
Team Dai-Gurren is to blame for the moon falling from the sky.
That anger is being directed at the New Government.
Your conversation with Nia was broadcast live across the world.
Every citizen now knows that the moon will slam into the Earth in three weeks' time.
Your reckless fight earlier was also seen by the entire city.
I can no longer protect you.
Protect me?
This is the guy!
It's all his fault!
Tear it down!
you are now no different from Lord Genome.
we must punish you in the same manner.
Exactly as we could not restrain ourselves from doing back then.
Please wait here until it is time for your trial.
Trial?
We are now a nation of laws.
Questions of war responsibility are also settled in a trial.
and now it's the law.
aren't you?
We have always made progress on the backs of the dead.
Such as my mother.
And Kamina.
What?
it made us stronger.
It was thanks to Kamina's death that we were able to win that battle.
Rossiu!
Are you trying to tell me that my Bro's dying was a good thing?
I am.
Don't joke about that!
There are some things you can't say!
Hey!
You bastard!
Do you really think that?
!
You are exactly like Kamina was in the old days.
Have you learned nothing from his death?
You haven't grown at all!
I will keep your Core Drill.
It's ironic.
The source of your power was the seed of mankind's destruction.
you'll never understand what he was feeling.
Or what his death gave to us.
That look in your eyes...
It's exactly the same as the priest back in Adai Village.
it is you who understands nothing.
You haven't so much as tried to change in the past seven years.
It is you.
So it's true what they say?
Simon's been arrested?
Yeah.
Why would they do that?
!
That's so messed up!
That jerk Rossiu's gone crazy!
don't shout in the hospital.
-Oops!
What Rossiu says makes a certain amount of sense.
What he did to Simon might only be a temporary solution.
but he's so coldhearted that I can't stand him.
What the heck does Kinon see in that guy?
Kiyal.
how can she not even stop by to see Anne?
too.
Kiyal!
but don't say that outside.
there's no telling what might happen.
Send out Simon!
The guy who's responsible has to pay!
Do you have a plan to deal with the moon falling?
!
What's the government doing?
!
Give me back my house!
Reimburse me!
I want my peaceful life back!
The Mugann's energy barrier can be breached by using the Giga Drill to reflect its beam back at it.
how do we stop the body itself from exploding?
This enemy is pretty tricky... aren't the Grapearls superior to Gurren Lagann?
It isn't right for the prototype to be more powerful.
what a cheeky thing to say.
Whatever shall I do to close that mouth of yours?
he's been the one guy I can't deal with...
What do you think is gonna happen with Simon?
You mean his arrest?
Arrest?
!
Is he gonna be executed?
!
Aretenborough.
I think that Rossiu has something up his sleeve.
our task at hand is developing weapons against our new enemies.
I guess it's no sleep for us until we come up with something... turn this report in to Rossiu.
You got it!
What...are...you...doing?
!
not to turn me!
Honestly!
Spinning?
Could it be?
Show us that again!
You got it!
NOT me!
We have completed our survey of surviving underground cities.
there are 36 cities over 1000 meters underground whose construction is estimated to be capable of withstanding the lunar impact.
000 people.
That's wonderful news.
That's more than we expected.
I suppose we owe a debt of gratitude to the humans of the past whose civilization reached such heights.
those humans were no match for the Anti-Spiral.
we will survive.
By any means necessary.
000.
The citizens here in Kamina City will be especially difficult.
Advisor Rossiu!
I found this file in the biocomputer's deep-level database.
What in the world?
Where is it?
!
Right underneath Kamina City's Parliament Tower.
Amazing!
That's the Spiral King for you...
He had this card up his sleeve the whole time.
Gurren Lagann
Gurren Lagann
I will now hand down the sentence.
The defendant is hereby sentenced to death.
hold on a second!
Get real!
What the hell?
!
This don't make no sense!
it was crazy to make Balinbow his defense attorney!
and you were the judge!
You never had any intention of giving him a fair trial!
Legal Affairs Chief Kittan.
the populace will never be satisfied.
if not Supreme Commander Simon?
But that don't mean you have to have him put to death!
but what about afterwards?
What do you plan to do about the falling moon?
An evacuation plan for that very purpose is already underway. swift action. with New Supreme Commander Rossiu at its heart.
Rossiu?
!
This is nothing of the sort.
I succeeded him.
what would you do?
Nia?
!
it's Nia!
Are you serious?
!
Where'd she come from?
What the Anti-Spiral want is absolute despair.
There is no hope of survival for Spiral life.
Nia?
absolute despair?
Why are you doing this?
!
meet your end in suffering as you clutch desperately to life.
Nia!
Don't go!
Cybela!
What's happened?
I'm detecting a Mugann above planned shelter area Littner.
It's a good deal larger than what we've seen before.
T-This is Littner Sector!
A huge clump of Mugann is heading this way!
We're under attack!
They're pulling out all the stops!
The shelter can't take much of this!
help us!
The Mugann have apparently begun moving towards Kamina city.
Littner...
What's happened to Littner?
Back to the Operations Room!
wait!
Let me...
Let me pilot Gurren Lagann.
What did you say?
Gurren Lagann is our only means of fighting against them.
eh?
That has nothing to do with it!
I just want to protect the city!
you are a condemned man.
Am I supposed to entrust a prisoner with Gurren Lagann when he might escape in it?
you son of a bitch!
all you have to do is detonate it!
Guinble.
Sir.
Disengage the lock on the Core Drill storeroom.
And don't forget to wire Gurren with explosives.
Have it done at once!
heading out!
Roger that.
I'm standing by and ready to go.
Kinon?
What are you doing aboard Gurren?
I've wired the detonator switch to my belt.
What?
!
I'll hit the switch.
This is crazy!
What do you think you're doing?
!
Why does Kinon have to come with me?
!
you have no choice but to return to base intact.
I expect you would try to go out in a blaze of heroic glory.
That doesn't mean you need to risk Kinon's life like this!
I volunteered to do this.
Kinon?
!
there won't be any trouble.
huh?
-Let's go!
-R-Right!
we are ready for your broadcast.
ain't that Gurren Lagann up there?
wasn't he?
What's going on?
Stand by for an urgent message from the government.
stand by for an urgent message from the government.
My fellow citizens. ...carried out by unknown enemies calling themselves the Anti-Spiral.
the New Government pressed charges against former Commander Simon.
he was sentenced to death.
There it is!
I can't let that thing get anywhere near Kamina City!
I'll stop it here!
I have dispatched Former Commander Simon in Gurren Lagann... ...but he is completely under the New Government's control.
We are able to blow it up if he exhibits any suspicious behavior whatsoever.
you bastard! ...the government will carry out a large-scale evacuation plan.
Citizens will be evacuated to 36 giant underground shelters around the world. ...will temporarily leave the stratosphere in the Superdreadnought Space Dai-Gun.
And this is that Space Dai-gun!
The Arc-Gurren!
Have faith in the New Government!
We will not be defeated by the Anti-Spiral!
no matter what!
Rossiu!
Rossiu!
Rossiu!
This will keep us alive!
Rossiu!
Simon!
The Mugann have turned around and are heading this way!
let's draw them away from Kamina City!
These guys are slow.
We'll go slow enough for them to keep up.
Right!
The beams have stopped...
Now they've just showing off...
This is bad...
They've got us heading towards Kamina City again!
Simon!
That big Mugann has stayed at a distance this whole time!
It's possible that it's their control tower!
I follow you...
Let's put that to the test!
You're mine!
Simon.
We're surrounded!
one Giga Drill will never be able to deflect them all!
Then we'll just use more than one!
GIGA DRILL MAXIMUM!
Kinon?
Are you okay?
Kinon!
I'm all right... the big one's still alive...
I can't move...
Damn it!
made it just in time!
Is that Gimmy?
we'll show you what the Grapearls can do!
Let's do it!
Tornado Formation!
Firing Spiral Bomber!
Erecting Tornado Shield!
it worked!
making it in time is all part of the job.
Kinon.
I'm sorry.
What we saw...
That wasn't the Nia I used to know.
please.
Gurren Lagann will be scrapped.
We will no longer rely on you.
I understand.
Simon!
Simon!
SIMON!
Rossiu!
what do you think you're doing to my sister?
!
that was Kinon?
!
Is that how you do things?
You're gonna pay...
You'll pay!
brother. ...it was because I wanted to be of use to Rossiu.
Kinon... you don't know the first thing about Rossiu. 348)}Sentenced to Death

Good morning, Sunshine.
You can call me Sunshine as long you promise to...
Ah, yes, letter of application.
Basic Tactical Operations course.
I'm signing it right now.
Thank you, Sarge.
My pleasure, Kira.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's fine.
Just... just the way it always is.
Gerald?
Hey, babe.
Where are you?
Nearly home.
How'd you sleep?
I didn't.
I kept hearing noises.
But you know you're safe, right?
I know.
- Hey, you know what?
- What?
I've got a surprise for you.
- You okay?
- I'm gonna wet my pants.
Okay.
Come on.
Let's go.
She's been missing for 12 hours.
Police say she was abducted last night from a playground in Sault Sainte Marie.
Her mother says her back was turned for only a second, and then, Lilly Deacon vanished.
Lilly was wearing a yellow dress and pink sandals.
She has long blonde hair, and has a birthmark under her chin shaped like a teardrop.
Please..
Hey, guys.
Hi, restroom?
Yeah, out back.
Hang on.
You need a key.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Hey, Sarge, Wordy said you wanted to see me?
Hey, Jules, grab a seat, will you?
?
Psych evaluations, you know they're mandatory, right?
Yeah, I do.
I just, uh...
You just haven't signed up for one yet.
Everyone else has done theirs already, and I wanted to make sure things were copacetic.
Everything's copacetic.
Look.
Look at me.
I'm signing up right now.
You know it's like this with you every year, Jules.
It's like, uh... nobody likes to do this.
I know, they just freak me out.
All those questions.
Who do you like better:
your mom or dad?
You want to garden or paint?
Fly a plane?
Jump on a train?
They're just questions.
No right or wrong answers.
That's the problem:
I like right or wrong.
You shoot.
There's a target.
You hit it.
Bull's-eye.
Bam.
You go home.
That's true.
You can be perfect.
Scared to make mistakes-- it's going to get in your way.
We're human.
We're going to get things wrong.
Hey, great.
So pump #2?
That's, uh, $47.28, please.
Hey, who's this?
What's your name?
Jack.
He's a little shy.
Oh.
Hey, Jack, uh, tell me.
What's your favorite flavor here: cherry or grape?
It's okay.
It's on the house.
Cherry.
Okay, but here comes the cherry airplane.
Up it goes.
How about some change?
Sure.
And here we go.
Oh...
- 911?
- Uh, yeah, um...
The-the missing girl?
Lilly, Lilly something?
Um, she's here.
She's here at my gas station.
And she's, she's with a man and he has a gun.
Ma'am, are you certain it's the child?
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.
She's wearing boy's clothes, and she has a birthmark underneath her chin.
Okay, ma'am, I need you to stay calm, but if you can get a license plate...
License plate...
License plate.
Team One, gear up.
We have a sighting of missing child
Lilly Deacon, traveling in a car license plate:
Romeo 1,
Bravo Uniform 4, Hotel 8.
Registered to a Gerald Duglin, 60 Red Brick Lane, East Scarborough.
Penny?
You're home.
I told you I was close.
Hello?
I want you to meet someone.
Surprise.
Penny, this is Lilly.

Team One, Child Services have been notified and they're standing by;
uniform units are en route to secure the perimeter.
Copy that.
Advise those units to use radio code only.
Media will be on their scanners, and this girl's been going through enough without all that.
This guy's been driving all night.
Lilly Deacon was abducted, what, 500 miles north of here.
You did a beautiful job, Penny.
It's clean, huh?
You could eaoff the floor.
Why?
Why what?
Why is she here?
Did I do something?
Lilly...
All right, what's going on?
Nothing.
My son-- he sent back another letter, "return to sender," big surprise.
You've got to see him in person.
Where...?
He's in Dallas, right?
You've got to go there.
It doesn't matter if they slam the door in your face.
Ah, I think I'm done, you know?
Lilly... follow me.
Come here.
This is really special, okay?
You are very important to me.
And this is going to help keep you safe.
There.
Now what do you say?
What do you say when someone gives you a present?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
here's how it works.
You get too close to a door or window, and you're going to feel a little buzz.
That's a warning.
And what happens if we don't pay attention to the buzz?
What happens if we go outside the house?
You cross the underground wire and the bracelet electric-shocks you and you die.
But you know what?
It's better to die than to get caught by the police 'cause you know what happens if you caught by the police?
They'll hurt you so bad, you'll wish you were dead.
11:32 a.m. Armed abduction of a child.
Subject Gerald Duglin presumed to be in the residence at 60 Red Brick Lane with the abducted child, Lilly Deacon.
This is where we have to stay until it's safe to go out again.
We have no choice.
It's what your parents wanted.
It's why they asked me to bring you here.
They didn't.
Yeah, they did.
Your dad and I had a long talk before we left last night.
My daddy wasn't there lastight.
He was in Buffalo with my grandma.
We talked on the phone.
Come here.
First rule of the house.
No talk-back.
You're probably hungry, huh?
That's good.
You know why?
'Cause Penny's going to make us lunch.
Penny.
Teenager next door confirmed Gera's car pulled in ten minutes ago.
He didn't notice a child.
As far as they know, he has no family, no children, and he is, quote, "quiet and kes to himself."
Yeah, I'll bet.
- You see his windows?
- Mm-hmm.
Every single one frosted, shuttered.
Apparently, he's a contractor.
Built this whole development.
Mug shot.
Okay.
The guy's got two priors for sexual assault.
Spent a couple months in jail a decade ago.
And he's got no weapons registered.
Except he's got one.
We have to have rules here.
Rules keep us safe.
It's all really, really simple.
Hey.
Why don't I show you the rest of the house?
Come on.
I'll take you upstairs.
Gerald...
Yes, Penny?
Um, let me show her around.
You're making lunch.
I can make it later.
What?
She's tired.
She- she only just got here.
I hear your voice one more time...
Please just let me take care of her.
Lilly, no!
Ow!
Hey!
Lilly!
Lilly, come here.
She's just scared, Gerald.
Penny, get in the closet.
No...
Gerald, no.
- In the closet.
- Please, please, she didn't mean it.
Gerald, no!
- Enough.
- No.
I've had enough.
That's enough, okay?
That's it.
I've had enoug of you.
Okay?
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna show you the rest of house first.
We can explore.
You want to see upstairs?
Come on.
Come on.
Pick up the phone.
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Duglin?
This is Sergeant Gregory Park, with the Police Strategic Response Unit.
Am I speaking with Gerald Duglin?
Mr. Duglin, a little girl has been abducted and we have reason to believe that she's inside your house.
Now if you and the other occupants can please exit, we can start talking about how you can safely return Lilly to her parents.
If you're interested in her safety, then you stay out of my house.
You step one foot in this house, and I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down.
- No!
- It's time.
They're here.
You know what to do.
?
Come on.
Pick up the phone.
Like we practiced, like I showed you.
- What's happening?
- Shh!
They've come, okay.
- Who?
Who's come?
- Don't worry.
I'll protect you.
Come on.
Quick, Penny.
Okay, take that.
Take that.
- Well, you're staying with us though...
- Shh, shh, shh.
We're going to need more ammo, okay?
We've got more in the basement.
- No, we don't have any time.
- I'll be right back.
Two minutes.
I'll be right back.
I promise.
Without you, no life.
Okay?
No.
Let me come with you.
- No!
- Gerald!
Gerald!
Please don't leave me!
11:43 a.m.
First telephone contact terminated by subject.
Threats uttered to hostage and police units.
All right.
He's not reestablishing.
Hey, Ed?
Holding in position.
I can't reestablish.
If you go in...
Dangerous for the girl, but if we don't go in...
Dangerous for the girl.
Copy that.
Spike, head to white, keep your eyes on the front.
Copy that.
We're in the garage.
Help me.
Help me tip the table.
Close the door.
We can't.
He's coming back.
How long do we have to stay in here?
As long as it takes.
Garage door breached.
Entry clear.
Kitchen's clear.
Boss, table's set for three.
Clear.
Living room's clear.
He saw us coming.
Sarge.
I'm looking at a box for an electric dog collar.
He might have a containment around the house.
So let's cut the circuit.
First floor clear.
We got something downstairs.
We got eyes.
Okay, we've got Lilly Deacon with another young woman, approximately 16 years of age in looks like the master bedroom.
No sign of Duglin.
Let's transmit that to Kira, see if she can ID that other girl.
Possible accomplice.
Hey, Sam, can you get another angle the bedroom?
See if Duglin's in there?
Copy that.
He's not in there, boss.
Boss, Lilly's upstairs, correct?
That's affirmative.
Where are you?
Basement steps.

How long have you lived here?
A long time.
Don'you ever want to go home?
Get down.
Guys, she's armed.
Yes, she is.
Camera's down.
All right, stand by for immediate action.
Let's get up closer to the house.
We're on the move.
We're gonna need two units lead us up.
Eddie, check in.
Where are you?
Boss, I don't know how he did it, but he's completely disappeared.
We lost him.
Go careful.
Duglin's not upstairs.
We're on the move.
You heard that, right?
It's like a... like a scraping sound or...
Ed, look at these marks on the floor.
Go, go, go.
Sarge, we found a tunnel.
We're going in.
Okay, you go for it, but keep me posted.
Sarge, I think I got a match on yougirl.
I'm sending it through now.
Rap sheet, a priors?
No, sir, found her in Missing Persons.
Matches an aged-up picture of Penny Westler.
Who?
Missing child taken from her own backyard eight years ago stranger abduction.
No arrest made.

Oh, my God.
She must be 17 by now.
Okay, team, subject is on foot.
Constables Lane and Wordsworth are in pursuit.
We've got the neighborhood contained.
We need to get this under control now.
We're in front of the house now.
Change the plan.
We're gonna talk this girl down.
Jules, I want you to do it.
Oh, Sarge, if you're right, this girl's been in here, like, ght years.
We're dealing with some serious Stockholm syndrome.
She probably doesn't even know who she is anymore.
I know, and my bet, he's conditioned her to fear the police, and that's why she's firing.
Now, you're gonna be fine.
This girl has spent eight years in captivity at the hands of a man.
What she needs now is a female voice.
All right, we're starting at ground zero.
I mean, I...
I don't know if I know how to do this.
All right, I'm coming in.
Okay, wait.
Can you help me with the Stockholm?
Yeah.
Now, the first thing to remember... there will be nothing simple about her feelings for her captor.
Just follow the same rules as always, connect, respect...
Protect.
Okay.
Okay, just keep it simple.
By now, Penny's got a belief system that has helped her survive whatever it is she survived, and it's not your job to tear that down.
It's your job to get these two girls out of there safely,
Okay?
And I'm gonna stay right here and be your second inside your ear the whole time,all right?
Copy.
Spike, you go with Sam;
you cover Jules.
Lou, we need to track down Penny's parents.
Get them here fast, but I need to talk to them first.
- Copy.
- Eddie, what's your 20?
We're in a tunnel heading west.
Okay, stay on it.
Kira, you want to map this out for us, tell us where the hell we are?
He's up ahead.
Go, go, go.
Hey, girls, my name is Jules.
Slow down, Jules.
Just work against the adrenaline.
Your names are Penny and Lilly.
Is that right?
Well, I'm a police officer, and I'm here to help you both.
You know, I'd really like to open these doors so that we can speak easier.
Is that okay?
All right, I'm opening the door, but I promise you, I'm gonna stay back here, all right?
Penny, is that right?
The little girl that you have with you, her name is Lilly Deacon, and I'm really hoping that we can return her safely to her mom and dad.
Can we can work that out?
Can you help us out with that?
Get away from us!
Team status-- everybody.
No harm.
- No harm, no harm.
- No harm.
- Sarge?
- De-escalate, Jules, de-escalate.
Whatever Penny's world was an hour ago, it's a whole lot more confusing now, so just... just keep doing what you're doing.
Just stay covered.
- How do they know my name?
- Shh.
Everything they say is a lie.
Penny?
I know that you are very scared right now.
I mean, you've got a gun with you.
And guns are always scary.
But I... but I really believe that you don't want to hurt anyone.
I really believe that, Penny.
So what do you think?
What do you think?
Can we get rid of the gun?
So that we can talk without being scared?
Penny, if you and Lilly don't say anything, how am I gonna know that you're okay?
Leave us alone!
Gerald?
Gerald!
What did you do to him?
Okay, okay, okay...
Sergeant,
I got Penny's parents on the line.
Squad car's got them en route.
Jules, Jules, you're doing great.
That's great news.
She made her first request.
She wants to know about Gerald, okay?
So remember, just take your time, slow it down, and get her to yellow.
Penny, I know that you want Lilly and Gerald to be safe.
So you know what...
you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna find out for you.
I'm gonna see where he is and how he's doing.
'Cause I think the guys I work with, they might know.
Do you want me to ask?
Yeah.
Okay.
Guys, any word on Duglin?
Guy tapped into some tunnel system in the basement.
Guy knows what he's doing.
Kira, we're in a tunnel with railroad tracks.
Where are we?
Brickworks-- whole subdivision used to be a brick factory.
Red Brick Lane, Kiln Avenue...
What's up ahead?
Which way you going?
Still heading west.
Westbound, tunnel ends in a warehouse.
You're gonna have to go up a level.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mrs. Westler, Mr. Westler,
I'm Greg Parker.
We spoke on the phone.
Where is she?
She's in that house, but we need to be incredibly patient here.
We haven't seen our daughter in eight years.
You can't imagine...
I understand, but Penny's exit from that house has to bon her terms, at her pace.
If she's rushed in any way, she may freeze up, she may escalate.
The only way we can get your daughter out of there safely is if we help her choose to come out.
She seems nice.
Why can't we just go?
Because... they'll capture us, and what happens after that is...
What?
- What?
- It's complicated.
Have you heard of Anne Frank?
She was a little girl who lid with her family in an attic for years waiting for it to be safe to go outside because bad people were in charge, and they sent police in to drag people away to barbwire prisons.
It was just like hell, but on earth.
Like devils and fire and people burning?
Exactly.
So that's just like now.
So we have to be brave and wait for Gerald to come back for us.
Penny, I found out about Gerald.
Do you want to hear?
Yeah.
Okay, well, this might sound kind of funny, but we... we don't know where he is.
No, No. you've captured him.
You had the house surrounded;
we saw it on the alarm screens;
you surrounded us.
I know...
I know that this seems impossible, but he left.
- No.
He won't leave.
- Penny, I promise you.
There's a tunnel that leads out of the basement.
You're making fun of me?
No, I'm not.
Penny, I would not make fun of you.
I know that you're waiting for Gerald to come back.
I can tell that you care a lot about him.
"So dear I love him that with him all deaths I could endure, without him no life."
It's from the book.
He's gone.
He's gone.
- He's gone.
- Penny?
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay...
It's gonna be okay.
I want to goome.
No, no, no, no.
I want to see my mommy and daddy.
No, they sent you here to be safe.
No, they... they didn't.
He made that up.
I'm going home.
No, Lilly, what are you doing?
I want to go home... now.
Sarge, Lilly wants to come out.
No, you can't walk out there.
They're going to send you to prison.
Lilly, we're not going to hurt you, I'm promise you on my life.
We're not going to hurt you.
Lilly, you can't walk out there.
Lilly, your mom and dad-- they're on a plane.
They're coming in from Sault Sainte Marie.
They're so excited to see you.
- I'm going home.
- Lilly!
I won't let them take you away!
What's going on, guys?
Penny's holding her gun on Lilly.
She thinks Lilly's going into a trap.
Jules, I don't have eyes in.
This is your call, but if Penny is threatening Lilly...
She's not going to hurt her.
Jules, stand down.
The little girl's the priority.
- Sam?
- I have it.
She's not going to hurt her.
Lilly?
Stay here.
Penny, we're not going to take Lilly anywhere, unless she chooses to go.
There is no choice.
That's what the book says.
Okay, I didn't read that book, Penny.
But this what I know about choice.
Okay?
Gerald made a choice today.
He chose to leave you.
And Lilly-- Lilly's making a choice.
She wants to see her mom and dad.
And you made an amazing choice.
The most amazing choice.
Because you just met this little girl, and you're protecting her, and not everybody would do that.
Penny, please, let her choose.
Please.
She's not going to hurt her.
Lilly?
!
Don't go outside!
You'll cross the underground wire...
Penny, she's going to be fine.
We cut the wire.
Why don't you look for yourself.
Why don't you look out the window, Penny.
Sam, hold off.
Lilly?
I have the solution.
Lilly, it's okay.
Okay, right down the stairs, okay?
There you go.
That's great.
Good, good.
All right?
Right over here, okay?
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be fine.
Ed.
That's a revolver, right?
Six in a chamber, that's number three.
Four.
Five.
Where's six?
Where's six?
Where's six?
Penny!
Penny!
Oh, my God.
You got it?
I got it.
Gerald, it's over.
Just put the gun down and come down those steps.
Hands in the air.
Hands where we can see 'em.
Stop!
Okay?
Just stop.
All right, it's up to you.
Just put the gun down and come down or we will come in there.
You have five seconds.
You don't understand.
No one does.
Explain it to me, Gerald.
This isn't what I wanted.
Yeah?
What did you want?
To be happy.
Just like anybody else.
You're not like everybody else, Gerald.
Put the gun down.
I can't.
Without her no life.
There's six.
- Jules...
- It's okay.
Penny.
Thank you for letting Lilly choose.
He said I'd die if I left the house.
Penny...
- No.
No!
You have him.
- We don't.
We don't.
You have him and he isn't coming back!
- We don't.
We do not have him.
- No!
Without him no life!
Okay, Penny.
Penny, please.
Please.
Two minutes.
That's what he said.
He said two minutes.
He promised.
He said he was coming back.
It's not true, is it?
He isn't coming back, is he?
Sarge, she's got her gun on Jules.
Jules, you gotta control this thing.
- I have the solution.
- Copy that, Sam.
Your call.
It's your call.
No.
Please.
Sarge, you gotta let me do this.
She's going to be okay.
Okay, Penny, I want to help you go home.
I want to help you remember the girl that you used to be.
Good thinking, Jules.
I'll get the mother on it.
Feed her memories.
Sarah, I need you to tell us about your child.
Any time that she felt joy or safe or loved or thrilled or anything.
I remember the snowstorm in the country.
We were walking, uh, trying to get to the house.
There was a snowstorm.
You and your parents.
And then we lost her.
Remember we couldn't find her?
And my heart was pounding.
Only for a minute they-they couldn't see you
- because of all the snow.
- Yeah and then we did.
We scooped up Pips, and we took her home.
And you got to stay up late.
Do you remember that?
And they gave you three desserts.
Oh, mosquito netting.
She used to have it over her bed like a canopy.
A canopy that was like a tent.
There were all these stuffed animals underneath.
The telescope she got when she turned nine-- it's still there;
it's still in her room.
Man, I wanted a telescope so bad when I was a kid.
?
, I don't even know where that is, but I guess you do.
'Cause that's what your parents are saying.
They're right outside, Penny.
They're right outside.
They're waiting for you.
Come on, Pips.
Come on.
Come on, Pips.
Pip...
Pip-sque?
That's what that means, right?
Yes.
That's what that means.
I know you're really scared, Penny.
I know.
I totally understand.
But outside-- that great big world-- it's even prettier than the one in your room.
It's your choice.
It's your choice.
It's up to you.
Yes?
Yeah.
Okay.
You're safe.
They're outside.
They're right outside.
On her time.
Her time.
Let her come to you.
Julianna Callaghan, you made me proud.
Yeah, and I wasn't even perfect.
No, you weren't.
You were human.
That's what those girls needed.
That's what they both needed to get out safe.
Screwing up and being human.
My biggest fear.
Copy that.
Look what happened.
Planets aligned.
It was a good day.
Right?
You coming for a drink?
I'm buying.
Na.
Actually, I'm going to go do something.
- But I'll see you Monday?
- Yeah.
Yep.
Right.
Your e-ticket and credit card.
Better hurry.
It's the last flight.
Dallas.
Long way to go for two days.
Not as long as it took me to do this.
This one's for focus, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's for focus.
Dad.
The stars-- they're still there.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
Come on.
Pick up the phone.
I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can...
- Penny?
- No!
It's time.
* When the blazing sun is gone *
* When he nothing shines upon *
* Then you show your little light *
* Twinkle,twinkle all the night.*
Hey, Pips.
Check this out.
Globular cluster.
Messier 3, I think.
Who ate the ketchup chips?
Must've been the coyotes.
Grape juice?
Coyotes drink grape juice, too?
Hey, Pips, see if you can find Saturn.
I'm going for more grape juice.
For me.
Not you, me.
* When the traveler in the dark *
* Thanks you for your tiny spark *
* He could not see which way to go...*
That was fast, Dad.
Dad?
Dad?
"Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light."
Good morning, Sunshine.
You can call me Sunshine as long you promise to...
Ah, yes, letter of application.
Basic Tactical Operations course.
I'm signing it right now.
- Thank you, Sarge.
- My pleasure, Kira.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's fine.
Just... just the way it always is.
Gerald?
Hey, babe.
Where are you?
Nearly home.
How'd you sleep?
I didn't.
I kept hearing noises.
- But you know you're safe, right?
- I know.
- Hey, you know what?
- What?
I've got a surprise for you.
- You okay?
- I'm gonna wet my pants.
Okay.
Come on.
Let's go.
She's been missing for 12 hours.
Police say she was abducted last night from a playground in Sault Sainte Marie.
Her mother says her back was turned for only a second, and then, Lilly Deacon vanished.
Lilly was wearing a yellow dress and pink sandals.
She has long blonde hair, and has a birthmark under her chin shaped like a teardrop.
Hey, guys.
- Hi, restroom?
- Yeah, out back.
Hang on.
- You need a key.
There you go.
- Thank you.
Hey, Sarge, Wordy said you wanted to see me?
Hey, Jules, grab a seat, will you?
Ooh, that bad?
Psych evaluations, you know they're mandatory, right?
Yeah, I do.
I just, uh...
You just haven't signed up for one yet.
Everyone else has done theirs already, and I wanted to make sure things were copacetic.
Everything's copacetic.
Look.
Look at me.
I'm signing up right now.
You know it's like this with you every year, Jules.
It's like, uh, nobody likes to do this.
I know, they just freak me out.
All those questions.
Who do you like better: your mom or dad?
You want to garden or paint?
Fly a plane?
Jump on a train?
They're just questions.
No right or wrong answers.
That's the problem:
I like right or wrong.
You shoot.
There's a target.
You hit it.
Bull's-eye.
Bam.
You go home.
That's true.
You can be perfect.
Scared to make mistakes-- it's going to get in your way.
We're human.
We're going to get things wrong.
Hey, great.
So pump #2?
That's, uh, $47. 28, please.
Hey, who's this?
What's your name?
Jack.
He's a little shy.
Hey, Jack, uh, tell me.
What's your favorite flavor here: cherry or grape?
It's okay.
It's on the house.
Cherry.
Okay, but here comes the cherry airplane.
Up it goes.
How about some change?
Sure.
Sorry about that.
And here we go.
911?
Uh, yeah, um...
The-the missing girl?
Lilly, Lilly something?
Um, she's here.
She's here at my gas station.
And she's, she's with a man and he has a gun.
Ma'am, are you certain it's the child?
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.
She's wearing boy's clothes, and she has a birthmark underneath her chin.
Okay, ma'am, I need you to stay calm, but if you can get a license plate...
License plate...
License plate.
Team One, gear up.
We have a sighting of missing child Lilly Deacon, traveling in a car license plate:
Romeo 1 Bravo Uniform 4 Hotel 8.
Registered to a Gerald Duglin, 60 Red Brick Lane, East Scarborough.
Penny?
You're home.
I told you I was close.
Hello?
I want you to meet someone.
Surprise.
Penny, this is Lilly.
Flashpoint Season01 Episode09
Team One, Child Services have been notified and they're standing by;
uniform units are en route to secure the perimeter.
Copy that.
Advise those units to use radio code only.
Media will be on their scanners, and this girl's been going through enough without all that.
This guy's been driving all night.
Lilly Deacon was abducted, what, 500 miles north of here.
You did a beautiful job, Penny.
It's clean, huh?
You could eat off the floor.
Why?
Why what?
Why is she here?
Did I do something?
All right, what's going on?
Nothing.
My son-- he sent back another letter, return to sender, big surprise.
You've got to see him in person.
Where...
He's in Dallas, right?
You've got to go there.
It doesn't matter if they slam the door in your face.
Ah, I think I'm done, you know?
Lilly... follow me.
Come here.
This is really special, okay?
You are very important to me.
And this is going to help keep you safe.
There.
Now what do you say?
What do you say when someone gives you a present?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Here's how it works.
You get too close to a door or window, and you're going to feel a little buzz.
That's a warning.
And what happens if we don't pay attention to the buzz?
What happens if we go outside the house?
You cross the underground wire and the bracelet electric-shocks you and you die.
But you know what?
It's better to die than to get caught by the police 'cause you know what happens if you caught by the police?
They'll hurt you so bad, you'll wish you were dead.
11:32 a.m. Armed abduction of a child.
Subject Gerald Duglin presumed to be in the residence at 60 Red Brick Lane with the abducted child, Lilly Deacon.
This is where we have to stay until it's safe to go out again.
We have no choice.
It's what your parents wanted.
It's why they asked me to bring you here.
They didn't.
Yeah, they did.
Your dad and I had a long talk before we left last night.
My daddy wasn't there last night.
He was in Buffalo with my grandma.
We talked on the phone.
Come here.
First rule of the house.
No talk-back.
You're probably hungry, huh?
That's good.
You know why?
'Cause Penny's going to make us lunch.
Penny.
Teenager next door confirmed Gerald's car pulled in ten minutes ago.
He didn't notice a child.
As far as they know, he has no family, no children, and he is, quote, "quiet and keeps to himself."
Yeah, I'll bet.
You see his windows?
Every single one frosted, shuttered.
Apparently, he's a contractor.
Built this whole development.
Mug shot.
Okay.
The guy's got two priors for sexual assault.
Spent a couple months in jail a decade ago.
And he's got no weapons registered.
Except he's got one.
We have to have rules here.
Rules keep us safe.
It's all really, really simple.
Why don't I show you the rest of the house?
Come on.
- I'll take you upstairs.
- Gerald...
Yes, Penny?
Um, let me show her around.
You're making lunch.
- I can make it later.
- What?
She's tired.
She-she only just got here.
I hear your voice one more time...
Please just let me take care of her.
Lilly, no!
Lilly!
Lilly, come here.
She's just scared, Gerald.
Penny, get in the closet.
No...
Gerald, no.
In the closet.
Please, please, she didn't mean it.
Gerald, no!
Enough.
I've had enough.
That's enough, okay?
That's it.
I've had enough of you.
Okay?
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna show you the rest of house first.
We can explore.
You want to see upstairs?
Come on.
Come on.
Pick up the phone.
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Duglin?
This is Sergeant Gregory Parker, with the Police Strategic Response Unit.
Am I speaking with Gerald Duglin?
Mr. Duglin, a little girl has been abducted and we have reason to believe that she's inside your house.
Now if you and the other occupants can please exit, we can start talking about how you can safely return Lilly to her parents.
If you're interested in her safety, then you stay out of my house.
You step one foot in this house, and I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down.
No!
It's time.
They're here.
You know what to do.
I know what to do.
Come on.
Pick up the phone.
Like we practiced, like I showed you.
What's happening?
They've come, okay.
- Who's come?
- Don't worry.
I'll protect you.
Come on.
Quick, Penny.
Okay, take that.
Take that.
Well, you're staying with us though...
We're going to need more ammo, okay?
- We've got more in the basement.I'll be right back.
- No, we don't have any time.
Two minutes.
I'll be right back.
I promise.
Without you, no life.
Okay?
No.
Let me come with you.
- No!
Gerald!
Gerald!
- Please don't leave me!
11:43 a.m.
First telephone contact terminated by subject.
Threats uttered to hostage and police units.
All right.
He's not reestablishing.
Hey, Ed?
Holding in position.
I can't reestablish.
If you go in...
Dangerous for the girl, but if we don't go in...
Dangerous for the girl.
Copy that.
Spike, head to white, keep your eyes on the front.
Copy that.
We're in the garage.
Help me.
Help me tip the table.
Close the door.
We can't.
He's coming back.
How long do we have to stay in here?
As long as it takes.
Garage door breached.
Entry clear.
Kitchen's clear.
Boss, table's set for three.
Clear.
Living room's clear.
He saw us coming.
Sarge.
I'm looking at a box for an electric dog collar.
He might have a containment around the house.
So let's cut the circuit.
First floor clear.
We got something downstairs.
We got eyes.
Okay, we've got Lilly Deacon with another young woman, approximately 16 years of age in... looks like the master bedroom.
No sign of Duglin.
Let's transmit that to Kira, see if she can ID that other girl.
Possible accomplice.
Hey, Sam, can you get another angle of the bedroom?
See if Duglin's in there?
Copy that.
He's not in there, boss.
Boss, Lilly's upstairs, correct?
That's affirmative.
Where are you?
Basement steps.
- Police Strategic Response Unit!
- Police!
- Get down!
- Weapons on the ground!
- Hands in the air!
Weapons on the ground!
- Let me see your hands!
Looks like somebody's been transcribing a book.
By hand.
Paradise Lost.
Milton.
Adam and Eve in Paradise.
Good stuff.
Fire and brimstone, my dad's kind of book.
How long have you lived here?
A long time.
Don't you ever want to go home?
Get down.
Guys, she's armed.
Yes, she is.
Camera's down.
All right, stand by for immediate action.
Let's get up closer to the house.
We're on the move.
We're gonna need two units lead us up.
Eddie, check in.
Where are you?
Boss, I don't know how he did it, but he's completely disappeared.
We lost him.
Go careful.
Duglin's not upstairs.
We're on the move.
You heard that, right?
It's like a...
like a scraping sound or...
Ed, look at these marks on the floor.
Go, go, go.
Sarge, we found a tunnel.
We're going in.
Okay, you go for it, but keep me posted.
Sarge, I think I got a match on your girl.
I'm sending it through now.
Rap sheet, any priors?
No, sir, found her in Missing Persons.
Matches an aged-up picture of Penny Westler.
Who?
Missing child taken from her own backyard eight years ago: stranger abduction.
- No arrest made.
- Oh, my God.
She must be 17 by now.
Okay, team, subject is on foot.
Constables Lane and Wordsworth are in pursuit.
We've got the neighborhood contained.
We need to get this under control now.
We're in front of the house now.
Change of plans: we're gonna talk this girl down.
Jules, I want you to do it.
Oh, Sarge, if you're right, this girl's been in here, like, eight years.
We're dealing with some serious Stockholm syndrome.
She probably doesn't even know who she is anymore.
I know, and my bet, he's conditioned her to fear the police, and that's why she's firing.
Now, you're gonna be fine.
This girl has spent eight years in captivity at the hands of a man.
What she needs now is a female voice.
All right, we're starting at ground zero.
I mean, I...
I don't know if I know how to do this.
All right, I'm coming in.
Okay, wait.
Can you help me with the Stockholm?
Yeah.
Now, the first thing to remember... there will be nothing simple about her feelings for her captor.
Just follow the same rules as always: connect, respect...
Protect.
Okay.
Okay, just keep it simple.
By now, Penny's got a belief system that has helped her survive whatever it is she survived, and it's not your job to tear that down.
It's your job to get these two girls out of there safely, and I'm gonna stay right here and be your second inside your ear the whole time, all right?
Copy.
Spike, you go with Sam; you cover Jules.
Lou, we need to track down Penny's parents.
Get them here fast, but I need to talk to them first.
- Copy.
- Eddie, what's your 20?
We're in a tunnel heading west.
Okay, stay on it.
Kira, you want to map this out for us, tell us where the hell we are?
He's up ahead.
Go, go, go.
Hey, girls, my name is Jules.
Slow down, Jules.
Just work against the adrenaline.
Your names are Penny and Lilly.
Is that right?
Well, I'm a police officer, and I'm here to help you both.
You know, I'd really like to open these doors so that we can speak easier.
Is that okay?
All right, I'm opening the door, but I promise you, I'm gonna stay back here, all right?
Penny, is that right?
The little girl that you have with you, her name is Lilly Deacon, and I'm really hoping that we can return her safely to her mom and dad.
Can we can work that out?
Can you help us out with that?
Get away from us!
Team status-- everybody.
No harm.
- No harm, no harm.
- No harm.
Sarge?
De-escalate, Jules, de-escalate.
Whatever Penny's world was an hour ago, it's a whole lot more confusing now, so just... just keep doing what you're doing.
Just stay covered.
How do they know my name?
Everything they say is a lie.
Penny?
I know that you are very scared right now.
I mean, you've got a gun with you.
And guns are always scary.
But I... but I really believe that you don't want to hurt anyone.
I really believe that, Penny.
So what do you think?
What do you think?
Can we get rid of the gun?
So that we can talk without being scared?
Penny, if you and Lilly don't say anything, how am I gonna know that you're okay?
Leave us alone!
Gerald?
Gerald!
What did you do to him?
Okay, okay, okay...
Sergeant, I got Penny's parents on the line.
Squad car's got them en route.
Jules, Jules, you're doing great.
That's great news.
She made her first request.
She wants to know about Gerald, okay?
So remember, just take your time, slow it down, and get her to yellow.
Penny, I know that you want Lilly and Gerald to be safe.
So you know what... you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna find out for you.
I'm gonna see where he is and how he's doing.
'Cause I think the guys I work with, they might know.
Do you want me to ask?
Yeah.
Okay.
Guys, any word on Duglin?
Guy tapped into some tunnel system in the basement.
Guy knows what he's doing.
Kira, we're in a tunnel with railroad tracks.
Where are we?
Brickworks-- whole subdivision used to be a brick factory.
Red Brick Lane, Kiln Avenue...
What's up ahead?
Which way you going?
Still heading west.
Westbound, tunnel ends in a warehouse.
You're gonna have to go up a level.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mrs. Westler, Mr. Westler, I'm Greg Parker.
We spoke on the phone.
Where is she?
She's in that house, but we need to be incredibly patient here.
We haven't seen our daughter in eight years.
You can't imagine...
I understand, but Penny's exit from that house has to be on her terms, at her pace.
If she's rushed in any way, she may freeze up, she may escalate.
The only way we can get your daughter out of there safely is if we help her choose to come out.
She seems nice.
Why can't we just go?
Because... they'll capture us, and what happens after that is...
What?
What?
It's complicated.
Have you heard of Anne Frank?
She was a little girl who lived with her family in an attic for years waiting for it to be safe to go outside because bad people were in charge, and they sent police in to drag people away to barbwire prisons.
It was just like hell, but on earth.
Like devils and fire and people burning?
Exactly.
So that's just like now.
So we have to be brave and wait for Gerald to come back for us.
Penny, I found out about Gerald.
Do you want to hear?
Yeah.
Okay, well, this might sound kind of funny, but we... we don't know where he is.
No.
No, you've captured him.
You had the house surrounded; we saw it on the alarm screens; you surrounded us.
I know...
I know that this seems impossible, but he left.
No, he wouldn't leave.
Penny, I promise you.
There's a tunnel that leads out of the basement.
You're making fun of me?
No, I'm not.
Penny, I would not make fun of you.
I know that you're waiting for Gerald to come back.
I can tell that you care a lot about him.
"So dear I love him that with him all deaths I could endure, without him no life."
It's from the book.
He's gone.
He's gone.
He's gone.
- Penny?
- it's okay.
It's gonna be okay...
It's gonna be okay.
I want to go home.
No, no, no, no.
I want to see my mommy and daddy.
No, they sent you here to be safe.
No, they... they didn't.
He made that up.
I'm going home.
No, Lilly, what are you doing?
I want to go home... now.
Sarge, Lilly wants to come out.
No, you can't walk out there.
They're going to send you to prison.
Lilly, we're not going to hurt you, I'm promise you on my life.
We're not going to hurt you.
Lilly, you can't walk out there.
Lilly, your mom and dad-- they're on a plane.
They're coming in from Sault Sainte Marie.
They're so excited to see you.
- I'm going home.
- Lilly!
I won't let them take you away!
Penny, we're not going to take Lilly anywhere, unless she chooses to go.
There is no choice.
That's what the book says.
Okay, I didn't read that book, Penny.
But this what I know about choice.
Okay?
Gerald made a choice today.
He chose to leave you.
And Lilly-
- Lilly's making a choice.
She wants to see her mom and dad.
And you made an amazing choice.
The most amazing choice.
Because you just met this little girl, and you're protecting her, and not everybody would do that.
Penny, please, let her choose.
Please.
She's not going to hurt her.
Lilly?
Don't go outside!
You'll cross the underground wire...
Penny, she's going to be fine.
We cut the wire.
Why don't you look for yourself.
Why don't you look out the window, Penny.
Sam, hold off.
Lilly?
I have the solution.
Lilly, it's okay.
Okay, right down the stairs, okay?
There you go.
That's great.
Good, good.
All right?
Right over here, okay?
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be fine.
Ed.
That's a revolver, right?
Six in a chamber, that's number three.
Four.
Five.
Where's six?
Where's six?
Where's six?
Penny!
Penny!
Oh, my God.
You got it?
I got it.
Gerald, it's over.
Just put the gun down and come down those steps.
Hands in the air.
Hands where we can see 'em.
Stop!
Okay?
Just stop.
All right, it's up to you.
Just put the gun down and come down or we will come in there.
You have five seconds.
You don't understand.
No one does.
Explain it to me, Gerald.
This isn't what I wanted.
Yeah?
What did you want?
To be happy.
Just like anybody else.
You're not like everybody else, Gerald.
Put the gun down.
I can't.
Without her no life.
There's six.
- Jules...
- It's okay.
Penny.
Thank you for letting Lilly choose.
He said I'd die if I left the house.
Penny...
No.
No!
You have him.
We don't.
We don't.
You have him and he isn't coming back!
We don't.
We do not have him.
No!
Without him no life!
Okay, Penny.
Penny, please.
Please.
Two minutes.
That's what he said.
He said two minutes.
He promised.
He said he was coming back.
It's not true, is it?
He isn't coming back, is he?
Sarge, she's got her gun on Jules.
Jules, you gotta control this thing.
I have the solution.
Copy that, Sam.
Your call.
It's your call.
No.
Please.
Sarge, you gotta let me do this.
She's going to be okay.
Okay, Penny, I want to help you go home.
I want to help you remember the girl that you used to be.
Good thinking, Jules.
I'll get the mother on it.
Feed her memories.
Sarah, I need you to tell us about your child.
Any time that she felt joy or safe or loved or thrilled or anything.
I remember the snowstorm in the country.
We were walking, uh, trying to get to the house.
There was a snowstorm.
You and your parents.
And then we lost her.
Remember we couldn't find her?
And my heart was pounding.
Only for a minute they-they couldn't see you because of all the snow.
Yeah, and then we did.
We scooped up Pips, and we took her home.
And you got to stay up late.
Do you remember that?
And they gave you three desserts.
Oh, mosquito netting.
She used to have it over her bed like a canopy.
A canopy that was like a tent.
And there were all these stuffed animals underneath.
The telescope she got when she turned nine-- it's still there; it's still in her room.
Man, I wanted a telescope so bad when I was a kid.
Saturn.
I don't even know where that is, but I guess you do.
'Cause that's what your parents are saying.
They're right outside, Penny.
They're right outside.
They're waiting for you.
Come on, Pips.
Come on.
Come on, Pips.
Pip...
Pip-squeak?
- That's what that means, right?
- Yes.
That's what that means.
I know you're really scared, Penny.
I know.
I totally understand.
But outside-- that great big world-- it's even prettier than the one in your room.
It's your choice.
It's your choice.
It's up to you.
Yes?
Yeah.
Okay.
You're safe.
They're outside.
They're right outside.
On her time.
Her time.
Let her come to you.
Julianna Callaghan, you made me proud.
Yeah, and I wasn't even perfect.
No, you weren't.
You were human.
That's what those girls needed.
That's what they both needed to get out safe.
Screwing up and being human.
My biggest fear.
Copy that.
Look what happened.
Planets aligned.
It was a good day.
Right?
You coming for a drink?
I'm buying.
Nah.
Actually, I'm going to go do something.
But I'll see you Monday?
Yeah.
Yep.
Right.
Your e-ticket and credit card.
Better hurry.
It's the last flight.
Dallas.
Long way to go for two days.
Not as long as it took me to do this.
This one's for focus, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's for focus.
Dad.
The stars-- they're still there.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make heaven of hell, hell of heaven.
Come on.
Pick up the phone.
I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can...
- Penny?
- No!
It's time.

* When he nothing shines upon *

Check this out.
Globular cluster.

Who ate the ketchup chips?
Must've been the coyotes.
Grape juice?
Coyotes drink grape juice, too?
Hey, Pips, see if you can find Saturn.
I'm going for more grape juice.
For me.
Not you, me.
* When the traveler in the dark *
* Thanks you for your tiny spark *
* He could not see which way to go...*
That was fast, Dad.
Dad?
Dad?
"Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light."
Good morning, Sunshine.
You can call me Sunshine as long you promise to...
Ah, yes, letter of application.
Basic Tactical Operations course.
I'm signing it right now.
- Thank you, Sarge.
- My pleasure, Kira.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's fine.
Just... just the way it always is.
Gerald?
Hey, babe.
Where are you?
Nearly home.
How'd you sleep?
I didn't.
I kept hearing noises.
- But you know you're safe, right?
- I know.
- Hey, you know what?
- What?
I've got a surprise for you.
- You okay?
- I'm gonna wet my pants.
Okay.
Come on.
Let's go.
She's been missing for 12 hours.
Police say she was abducted last night from a playground in Sault Sainte Marie.
Her mother says her back was turned for only a second, and then, Lilly Deacon vanished.
Lilly was wearing a yellow dress and pink sandals.
She has long blonde hair, and has a birthmark under her chin shaped like a teardrop.
Hey, guys.
- Hi, restroom?
- Yeah, out back.
Hang on.
- You need a key.
There you go.
- Thank you.
Hey, Sarge, Wordy said you wanted to see me?
Hey, Jules, grab a seat, will you?
Ooh, that bad?
Psych evaluations, you know they're mandatory, right?
Yeah, I do.
I just, uh...
You just haven't signed up for one yet.
Everyone else has done theirs already, and I wanted to make sure things were copacetic.
Everything's copacetic.
Look.
Look at me.
I'm signing up right now.
You know it's like this with you every year, Jules.
It's like, uh, nobody likes to do this.
I know, they just freak me out.
All those questions.
Who do you like better: your mom or dad?
You want to garden or paint?
Fly a plane?
Jump on a train?
They're just questions.
No right or wrong answers.
That's the problem:
I like right or wrong.
You shoot.
There's a target.
You hit it.
Bull's-eye.
Bam.
You go home.
That's true.
You can be perfect.
Scared to make mistakes-- it's going to get in your way.
We're human.
We're going to get things wrong.
Hey, great.
So pump #2?
That's, uh, $47. 28, please.
Hey, who's this?
What's your name?
Jack.
He's a little shy.
Hey, Jack, uh, tell me.
What's your favorite flavor here: cherry or grape?
It's okay.
It's on the house.
Cherry.
Okay, but here comes the cherry airplane.
Up it goes.
How about some change?
Sure.
Sorry about that.
And here we go.
911?
Uh, yeah, um...
The-the missing girl?
Lilly, Lilly something?
Um, she's here.
She's here at my gas station.
And she's, she's with a man and he has a gun.
Ma'am, are you certain it's the child?
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.
She's wearing boy's clothes, and she has a birthmark underneath her chin.
Okay, ma'am, I need you to stay calm, but if you can get a license plate...
License plate...
License plate.
Team One, gear up.
We have a sighting of missing child Lilly Deacon, traveling in a car license plate:
Romeo 1 Bravo Uniform 4 Hotel 8.
Registered to a Gerald Duglin, 60 Red Brick Lane, East Scarborough.
Penny?
You're home.
I told you I was close.
Hello?
I want you to meet someone.
Surprise.
Penny, this is Lilly.
Flashpoint Season01 Episode09
Team One, Child Services have been notified and they're standing by;
uniform units are en route to secure the perimeter.
Copy that.
Advise those units to use radio code only.
Media will be on their scanners, and this girl's been going through enough without all that.
This guy's been driving all night.
Lilly Deacon was abducted, what, 500 miles north of here.
You did a beautiful job, Penny.
It's clean, huh?
You could eat off the floor.
Why?
Why what?
Why is she here?
Did I do something?
All right, what's going on?
Nothing.
My son-- he sent back another letter, return to sender, big surprise.
You've got to see him in person.
Where...
He's in Dallas, right?
You've got to go there.
It doesn't matter if they slam the door in your face.
Ah, I think I'm done, you know?
Lilly... follow me.
Come here.
This is really special, okay?
You are very important to me.
And this is going to help keep you safe.
There.
Now what do you say?
What do you say when someone gives you a present?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Here's how it works.
You get too close to a door or window, and you're going to feel a little buzz.
That's a warning.
And what happens if we don't pay attention to the buzz?
What happens if we go outside the house?
You cross the underground wire and the bracelet electric-shocks you and you die.
But you know what?
It's better to die than to get caught by the police 'cause you know what happens if you caught by the police?
They'll hurt you so bad, you'll wish you were dead.
11:32 a.m. Armed abduction of a child.
Subject Gerald Duglin presumed to be in the residence at 60 Red Brick Lane with the abducted child, Lilly Deacon.
This is where we have to stay until it's safe to go out again.
We have no choice.
It's what your parents wanted.
It's why they asked me to bring you here.
They didn't.
Yeah, they did.
Your dad and I had a long talk before we left last night.
My daddy wasn't there last night.
He was in Buffalo with my grandma.
We talked on the phone.
Come here.
First rule of the house.
No talk-back.
You're probably hungry, huh?
That's good.
You know why?
'Cause Penny's going to make us lunch.
Penny.
Teenager next door confirmed Gerald's car pulled in ten minutes ago.
He didn't notice a child.
As far as they know, he has no family, no children, and he is, quote, "quiet and keeps to himself."
Yeah, I'll bet.
You see his windows?
Every single one frosted, shuttered.
Apparently, he's a contractor.
Built this whole development.
Mug shot.
Okay.
The guy's got two priors for sexual assault.
Spent a couple months in jail a decade ago.
And he's got no weapons registered.
Except he's got one.
We have to have rules here.
Rules keep us safe.
It's all really, really simple.
Why don't I show you the rest of the house?
Come on.
- I'll take you upstairs.
- Gerald...
Yes, Penny?
Um, let me show her around.
You're making lunch.
- I can make it later.
- What?
She's tired.
She-she only just got here.
I hear your voice one more time...
Please just let me take care of her.
Lilly, no!
Lilly!
Lilly, come here.
She's just scared, Gerald.
Penny, get in the closet.
No...
Gerald, no.
In the closet.
Please, please, she didn't mean it.
Gerald, no!
Enough.
I've had enough.
That's enough, okay?
That's it.
I've had enough of you.
Okay?
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna show you the rest of house first.
We can explore.
You want to see upstairs?
Come on.
Come on.
Pick up the phone.
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Duglin?
This is Sergeant Gregory Parker, with the Police Strategic Response Unit.
Am I speaking with Gerald Duglin?
Mr. Duglin, a little girl has been abducted and we have reason to believe that she's inside your house.
Now if you and the other occupants can please exit, we can start talking about how you can safely return Lilly to her parents.
If you're interested in her safety, then you stay out of my house.
You step one foot in this house, and I swear to God I will kill her and I will take you down.
No!
It's time.
They're here.
You know what to do.
I know what to do.
Come on.
Pick up the phone.
Like we practiced, like I showed you.
What's happening?
They've come, okay.
- Who's come?
- Don't worry.
I'll protect you.
Come on.
Quick, Penny.
Okay, take that.
Take that.
Well, you're staying with us though...
We're going to need more ammo, okay?
- We've got more in the basement.I'll be right back.
- No, we don't have any time.
Two minutes.
I'll be right back.
I promise.
Without you, no life.
Okay?
No.
Let me come with you.
- No!
Gerald!
Gerald!
- Please don't leave me!
11:43 a.m.
First telephone contact terminated by subject.
Threats uttered to hostage and police units.
All right.
He's not reestablishing.
Hey, Ed?
Holding in position.
I can't reestablish.
If you go in...
Dangerous for the girl, but if we don't go in...
Dangerous for the girl.
Copy that.
Spike, head to white, keep your eyes on the front.
Copy that.
We're in the garage.
Help me.
Help me tip the table.
Close the door.
We can't.
He's coming back.
How long do we have to stay in here?
As long as it takes.
Garage door breached.
Entry clear.
Kitchen's clear.
Boss, table's set for three.
Clear.
Living room's clear.
He saw us coming.
Sarge.
I'm looking at a box for an electric dog collar.
He might have a containment around the house.
So let's cut the circuit.
First floor clear.
We got something downstairs.
We got eyes.
Okay, we've got Lilly Deacon with another young woman, approximately 16 years of age in... looks like the master bedroom.
No sign of Duglin.
Let's transmit that to Kira, see if she can ID that other girl.
Possible accomplice.
Hey, Sam, can you get another angle of the bedroom?
See if Duglin's in there?
Copy that.
He's not in there, boss.
Boss, Lilly's upstairs, correct?
That's affirmative.
Where are you?
Basement steps.
- Police Strategic Response Unit!
- Police!
- Get down!
- Weapons on the ground!
- Hands in the air!
Weapons on the ground!
- Let me see your hands!
Looks like somebody's been transcribing a book.
By hand.
Paradise Lost.
Milton.
Adam and Eve in Paradise.
Good stuff.
Fire and brimstone, my dad's kind of book.
How long have you lived here?
A long time.
Don't you ever want to go home?
Get down.
Guys, she's armed.
Yes, she is.
Camera's down.
All right, stand by for immediate action.
Let's get up closer to the house.
We're on the move.
We're gonna need two units lead us up.
Eddie, check in.
Where are you?
Boss, I don't know how he did it, but he's completely disappeared.
We lost him.
Go careful.
Duglin's not upstairs.
We're on the move.
You heard that, right?
It's like a...
like a scraping sound or...
Ed, look at these marks on the floor.
Go, go, go.
Sarge, we found a tunnel.
We're going in.
Okay, you go for it, but keep me posted.
Sarge, I think I got a match on your girl.
I'm sending it through now.
Rap sheet, any priors?
No, sir, found her in Missing Persons.
Matches an aged-up picture of Penny Westler.
Who?
Missing child taken from her own backyard eight years ago: stranger abduction.
- No arrest made.
- Oh, my God.
She must be 17 by now.
Okay, team, subject is on foot.
Constables Lane and Wordsworth are in pursuit.
We've got the neighborhood contained.
We need to get this under control now.
We're in front of the house now.
Change of plans: we're gonna talk this girl down.
Jules, I want you to do it.
Oh, Sarge, if you're right, this girl's been in here, like, eight years.
We're dealing with some serious Stockholm syndrome.
She probably doesn't even know who she is anymore.
I know, and my bet, he's conditioned her to fear the police, and that's why she's firing.
Now, you're gonna be fine.
This girl has spent eight years in captivity at the hands of a man.
What she needs now is a female voice.
All right, we're starting at ground zero.
I mean, I...
I don't know if I know how to do this.
All right, I'm coming in.
Okay, wait.
Can you help me with the Stockholm?
Yeah.
Now, the first thing to remember... there will be nothing simple about her feelings for her captor.
Just follow the same rules as always: connect, respect...
Protect.
Okay.
Okay, just keep it simple.
By now, Penny's got a belief system that has helped her survive whatever it is she survived, and it's not your job to tear that down.
It's your job to get these two girls out of there safely, and I'm gonna stay right here and be your second inside your ear the whole time, all right?
Copy.
Spike, you go with Sam; you cover Jules.
Lou, we need to track down Penny's parents.
Get them here fast, but I need to talk to them first.
- Copy.
- Eddie, what's your 20?
We're in a tunnel heading west.
Okay, stay on it.
Kira, you want to map this out for us, tell us where the hell we are?
He's up ahead.
Go, go, go.
Hey, girls, my name is Jules.
Slow down, Jules.
Just work against the adrenaline.
Your names are Penny and Lilly.
Is that right?
Well, I'm a police officer, and I'm here to help you both.
You know, I'd really like to open these doors so that we can speak easier.
Is that okay?
All right, I'm opening the door, but I promise you, I'm gonna stay back here, all right?
Penny, is that right?
The little girl that you have with you, her name is Lilly Deacon, and I'm really hoping that we can return her safely to her mom and dad.
Can we can work that out?
Can you help us out with that?
Get away from us!
Team status-- everybody.
No harm.
- No harm, no harm.
- No harm.
Sarge?
De-escalate, Jules, de-escalate.
Whatever Penny's world was an hour ago, it's a whole lot more confusing now, so just... just keep doing what you're doing.
Just stay covered.
How do they know my name?
Everything they say is a lie.
Penny?
I know that you are very scared right now.
I mean, you've got a gun with you.
And guns are always scary.
But I... but I really believe that you don't want to hurt anyone.
I really believe that, Penny.
So what do you think?
What do you think?
Can we get rid of the gun?
So that we can talk without being scared?
Penny, if you and Lilly don't say anything, how am I gonna know that you're okay?
Leave us alone!
Gerald?
Gerald!
What did you do to him?
Okay, okay, okay...
Sergeant, I got Penny's parents on the line.
Squad car's got them en route.
Jules, Jules, you're doing great.
That's great news.
She made her first request.
She wants to know about Gerald, okay?
So remember, just take your time, slow it down, and get her to yellow.
Penny, I know that you want Lilly and Gerald to be safe.
So you know what... you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna find out for you.
I'm gonna see where he is and how he's doing.
'Cause I think the guys I work with, they might know.
Do you want me to ask?
Yeah.
Okay.
Guys, any word on Duglin?
Guy tapped into some tunnel system in the basement.
Guy knows what he's doing.
Kira, we're in a tunnel with railroad tracks.
Where are we?
Brickworks-- whole subdivision used to be a brick factory.
Red Brick Lane, Kiln Avenue...
What's up ahead?
Which way you going?
Still heading west.
Westbound, tunnel ends in a warehouse.
You're gonna have to go up a level.
Where is he?
Where is he?
Mrs. Westler, Mr. Westler, I'm Greg Parker.
We spoke on the phone.
Where is she?
She's in that house, but we need to be incredibly patient here.
We haven't seen our daughter in eight years.
You can't imagine...
I understand, but Penny's exit from that house has to be on her terms, at her pace.
If she's rushed in any way, she may freeze up, she may escalate.
The only way we can get your daughter out of there safely is if we help her choose to come out.
She seems nice.
Why can't we just go?
Because... they'll capture us, and what happens after that is...
What?
What?
It's complicated.
Have you heard of Anne Frank?
She was a little girl who lived with her family in an attic for years waiting for it to be safe to go outside because bad people were in charge, and they sent police in to drag people away to barbwire prisons.
It was just like hell, but on earth.
Like devils and fire and people burning?
Exactly.
So that's just like now.
So we have to be brave and wait for Gerald to come back for us.
Penny, I found out about Gerald.
Do you want to hear?
Yeah.
Okay, well, this might sound kind of funny, but we... we don't know where he is.
No.
No, you've captured him.
You had the house surrounded; we saw it on the alarm screens; you surrounded us.
I know...
I know that this seems impossible, but he left.
No, he wouldn't leave.
Penny, I promise you.
There's a tunnel that leads out of the basement.
You're making fun of me?
No, I'm not.
Penny, I would not make fun of you.
I know that you're waiting for Gerald to come back.
I can tell that you care a lot about him.
"So dear I love him that with him all deaths I could endure, without him no life."
It's from the book.
He's gone.
He's gone.
He's gone.
- Penny?
- it's okay.
It's gonna be okay...
It's gonna be okay.
I want to go home.
No, no, no, no.
I want to see my mommy and daddy.
No, they sent you here to be safe.
No, they... they didn't.
He made that up.
I'm going home.
No, Lilly, what are you doing?
I want to go home... now.
Sarge, Lilly wants to come out.
No, you can't walk out there.
They're going to send you to prison.
Lilly, we're not going to hurt you, I'm promise you on my life.
We're not going to hurt you.
Lilly, you can't walk out there.
Lilly, your mom and dad-- they're on a plane.
They're coming in from Sault Sainte Marie.
They're so excited to see you.
- I'm going home.
- Lilly!
I won't let them take you away!
What's going on, guys?
Penny's holding her gun on Lilly.
She thinks Lilly's going into a trap.
Jules, I don't have eyes in.
This is your call, but if Penny is threatening Lilly...
She's not going to hurt her.
Jules, stand down.
The little girl's the priority.
Sam?
I have it.
She's not going to hurt her.
Lilly?
Stay here.
Penny, we're not going to take Lilly anywhere, unless she chooses to go.
There is no choice.
That's what the book says.
Okay, I didn't read that book, Penny.
But this what I know about choice.
Okay?
Gerald made a choice today.
He chose to leave you.
And Lilly-
- Lilly's making a choice.
She wants to see her mom and dad.
And you made an amazing choice.
The most amazing choice.
Because you just met this little girl, and you're protecting her, and not everybody would do that.
Penny, please, let her choose.
Please.
She's not going to hurt her.
Lilly?
Don't go outside!
You'll cross the underground wire...
Penny, she's going to be fine.
We cut the wire.
Why don't you look for yourself.
Why don't you look out the window, Penny.
Sam, hold off.
Lilly?
I have the solution.
Lilly, it's okay.
Okay, right down the stairs, okay?
There you go.
That's great.
Good, good.
All right?
Right over here, okay?
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be fine.
Ed.
That's a revolver, right?
Six in a chamber, that's number three.
Four.
Five.
Where's six?
Where's six?
Where's six?
Penny!
Penny!
Oh, my God.
You got it?
I got it.
Gerald, it's over.
Just put the gun down and come down those steps.
Hands in the air.
Hands where we can see 'em.
Stop!
Okay?
Just stop.
All right, it's up to you.
Just put the gun down and come down or we will come in there.
You have five seconds.
You don't understand.
No one does.
Explain it to me, Gerald.
This isn't what I wanted.
Yeah?
What did you want?
To be happy.
Just like anybody else.
You're not like everybody else, Gerald.
Put the gun down.
I can't.
Without her no life.
There's six.
- Jules...
- It's okay.
Penny.
Thank you for letting Lilly choose.
He said I'd die if I left the house.
Penny...
No.
No!
You have him.
We don't.
We don't.
You have him and he isn't coming back!
We don't.
We do not have him.
No!
Without him no life!
Okay, Penny.
Penny, please.
Please.
Two minutes.
That's what he said.
He said two minutes.
He promised.
He said he was coming back.
It's not true, is it?
He isn't coming back, is he?
Sarge, she's got her gun on Jules.
Jules, you gotta control this thing.
I have the solution.
Copy that, Sam.
Your call.
It's your call.
No.
Please.
Sarge, you gotta let me do this.
She's going to be okay.
Okay, Penny, I want to help you go home.
I want to help you remember the girl that you used to be.
Good thinking, Jules.
I'll get the mother on it.
Feed her memories.
Sarah, I need you to tell us about your child.
Any time that she felt joy or safe or loved or thrilled or anything.
I remember the snowstorm in the country.
We were walking, uh, trying to get to the house.
There was a snowstorm.
You and your parents.
And then we lost her.
Remember we couldn't find her?
And my heart was pounding.
Only for a minute they-they couldn't see you because of all the snow.
Yeah, and then we did.
We scooped up Pips, and we took her home.
And you got to stay up late.
Do you remember that?
And they gave you three desserts.
Oh, mosquito netting.
She used to have it over her bed like a canopy.
A canopy that was like a tent.
And there were all these stuffed animals underneath.
The telescope she got when she turned nine-- it's still there; it's still in her room.
Man, I wanted a telescope so bad when I was a kid.
Saturn.
I don't even know where that is, but I guess you do.
'Cause that's what your parents are saying.
They're right outside, Penny.
They're right outside.
They're waiting for you.
Come on, Pips.
Come on.
Come on, Pips.
Pip...
Pip-squeak?
- That's what that means, right?
- Yes.
That's what that means.
I know you're really scared, Penny.
I know.
I totally understand.
But outside-- that great big world-- it's even prettier than the one in your room.
It's your choice.
It's your choice.
It's up to you.
Yes?
Yeah.
Okay.
You're safe.
They're outside.
They're right outside.
On her time.
Her time.
Let her come to you.
Julianna Callaghan, you made me proud.
Yeah, and I wasn't even perfect.
No, you weren't.
You were human.
That's what those girls needed.
That's what they both needed to get out safe.
Screwing up and being human.
My biggest fear.
Copy that.
Look what happened.
Planets aligned.
It was a good day.
Right?
You coming for a drink?
I'm buying.
Nah.
Actually, I'm going to go do something.
But I'll see you Monday?
Yeah.
Yep.
Right.
Your e-ticket and credit card.
Better hurry.
It's the last flight.
Dallas.
Long way to go for two days.
Not as long as it took me to do this.
This one's for focus, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's for focus.
Dad.
The stars-- they're still there.
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H. R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down. "
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.
M.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome. "
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome. "
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives. "
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
N BC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents. "
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
Haldeman.
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches. "
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer. "
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer. "
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable loneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
David.
Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
Here we go.
Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David!
David!
David!
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
Liar!
Here comes the President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency. "
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
Good, good.
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer. "
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President, please!
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape. 30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
... and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago. "
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11- 0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President!
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice. "
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation. "
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem. "
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten. "
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt. "
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile. "
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled. " Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it. "
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got. "
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can. "
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
I...
Shit!
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President. "
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that. " And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate. "
NIXON ON TAPE:
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
NIXON AIDE:
Well, I think, if they...
NIXON:
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
NIXON:
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
MAN:
Yeah.
NIXON:
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
NEWS REPORTER 1:
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
NEWS REPORTER 2:
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN:
Stand by for camera.
MUDD:
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
DEAN:
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
NEWS REPORTER 3:
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
LAWYER:
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
NEWS REPORTER 4:
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
NEWS REPORTER 5:
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
(CROWD CHEERING)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR:
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
NIXON:
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
(FROST OVER AUSTRALIA THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
NOAH:
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
NEWS REPORTER:
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
NEWS REPORTER:
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
NEWS REPORTER:
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
BRENNAN:
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
CHANCELLOR:
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
GANNON:
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
SWIFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
NIXON:
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
(STUTTERING) No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
SWIFTY:
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
BIRT:
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
MAN:
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
(FROST LAUGHS)
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
CAROLINE:
No, thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
CAROLINE:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
PILO T:
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
... admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST:
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
(INDISTINCT)
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
FROST:
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
MANOLO:
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
NBC EXECUTIVE:
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
FROST:
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
FROST:
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
(INTERRUPTING) FROST:
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(SIGHS) You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELNICK:
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
RESTON:
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
BIRT:
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
BIRT:
Haldeman.
RESTON:
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON:
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
RESTON:
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
BIRT:
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON:
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
BIRT:
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLINE:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHONE RINGING)
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
(STAMMERS)
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
BIRT:
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
(CHEERING)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
KHACHIGIAN:
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
PRICE:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
GANNON:
People love that story.
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACHIGIAN:
Yeah, right, come on.
REPORTER 1:
David.
REPORTER 2:
Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 1:
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST:
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
REPORTER 1:
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
REPORTER 1:
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
NIXON:
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
GANNON:
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
FROST:
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and... (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
(INAUDIBLE)
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

Excuse me, fellas.
MAN:
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
WOMAN:
Liar!
MAN:
Here comes the President!
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 3:
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
RESTON:
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
FROST:
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
(CHUCKLES)
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
(HESITATES)
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
DAVIS:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
DIRECTOR:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN:
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
NIXON:
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
NIXON:
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
DAVIS:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON:
Good, good.
NIXON:
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER 3:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 4:
Mr. President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST:
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(NIXON CLEARS THROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASHING)
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
NIXON:
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
(WHISPERING) Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape. 30 seconds.
DAVIS:
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS THROAT)
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
... and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
SAWYER:
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELNICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(SIGHS) I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(SIGHING) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
I'll have a cheeseburger.
NIXON:
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
NIXON ON TAPE:
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, he is.
NIXON:
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
MITCHELL:
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON:
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
BIRT:
First time he's late.
REPORTER:
Mr. President!

Morning.
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
NIXON:
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
DAVIS:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
BRENNAN:
Get him in here.
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BRENNAN:
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELNICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN:
Bob, may I remind you...
BIRT:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGUING)
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GANNON:
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGUING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WHISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
DAVIS:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(SIGHS)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGINE STARTING)
The NixonlFrost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON:
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."

NEWS REPORTER 1:
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
NEWS REPORTER 2:
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN:
Stand by for camera.
MUDD:
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
DEAN:
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
NEWS REPORTER 3:
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
LAWYER:
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
NEWS REPORTER 4:
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
NEWS REPORTER 5:
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
(CROWD CHEERING)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR:
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
NIXON:
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
(FROST OVER AUSTRALIA THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
NOAH:
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
NEWS REPORTER:
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
NEWS REPORTER:
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
NEWS REPORTER: are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
BRENNAN:
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
CHANCELLOR:
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
GANNON:
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
SWIFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
NIXON:
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
(STUTTERING) No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
SWIFTY:
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
BIRT:
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
MAN:
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
(FROST LAUGHS)
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
CAROLINE:
No, thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
CAROLINE:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
PILO T:
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST:
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
(INDISTINCT)
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
FROST:
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
MANOLO:
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
NBC EXECUTIVE:
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
FROST:
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
FROST:
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
(INTERRUPTING) FROST:
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(SIGHS) You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELNICK:
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
RESTON:
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
BIRT:
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
BIRT:
Haldeman.
RESTON:
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON:
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
RESTON:
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
BIRT:
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON:
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
BIRT:
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLINE:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHONE RINGING)
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
(STAMMERS)
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
BIRT:
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
(CHEERING)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
KHACHIGIAN:
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
PRICE:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
GANNON:
People love that story.
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACHIGIAN:
Yeah, right, come on.
REPORTER 1:
David.
REPORTER 2:
Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 1:
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST:
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
REPORTER 1:
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
REPORTER 1:
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
NIXON:
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
GANNON:
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
FROST:
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
(INAUDIBLE)
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
Here we go.
OFFICER:
Back up behind the curb.
REPORTER 1:
A few questions, please.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Right here, Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 2:
David!
David!
David!
(ALL CLAMORING)
FROST:
Well, hello there.
(SIREN BLARING)
Excuse me, fellas.
MAN:
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
WOMAN:
Liar!
MAN:
Here comes the President!
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 3:
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
RESTON:
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
FROST:
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
(CHUCKLES)
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
(HESITATES)
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
DAVIS:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
DIRECTOR:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN:
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
NIXON:
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
NIXON:
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
DAVIS:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON:
Good, good.
NIXON:
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER 3:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 4:
Mr. President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST:
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(NIXON CLEARS THROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASHING)
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
NIXON:
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
(WHISPERING) Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
DAVIS:
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS THROAT)
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
SAWYER:
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELNICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(SIGHS) I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(SIGHING) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
I'll have a cheeseburger.
NIXON:
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
NIXON ON TAPE:
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, he is.
NIXON:
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
MITCHELL:
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON:
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
BIRT:
First time he's late.
REPORTER:
Mr. President!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Morning.
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
NIXON:
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
DAVIS:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
BRENNAN:
Get him in here.
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BRENNAN:
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELNICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN:
Bob, may I remind you...
BIRT:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGUING)
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GANNON:
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGUING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WHISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
DAVIS:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(SIGHS)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness, self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGINE STARTING)
The NixonlFrost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON:
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down. "
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a. m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome. "
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome. "
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives. "
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
- Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
- Come on.
- Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents. "
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
- Haldeman.
- Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people? "
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches. "
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer. "
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer. "
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
- David.
- Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
"A cascade of candor "?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
- Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
Here we go.
OFFICER:
Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David!
David!
David!
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
Liar!
Here comes the President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President.!
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency. "
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
- Yeah, sure.
- Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
- Good, good.
- Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer. "
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer? "
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President, please!
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape. 30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam, "
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
... and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago. "
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
- Got him.
- Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul,
isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President!
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice. "
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation. "
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem. "
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten. "
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt. "
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile. "
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled. " Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it. "
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got. "
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can. "
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
- Oh, my God, we got him.
- I...
Shit!
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
- He's in that truck out there.
- Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President. "
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that. " And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you, but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down, and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The NixonlFrost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate. "
NIXON ON TAPE:
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
NIXON AIDE:
Well, I think, if they...
NIXON: ...
internalRevenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
nixon:
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
MAN:
Yeah.
N IXON: ...or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
NEWS REPORTER 1 :
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
NEWS REPORTER 2:
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN :
Stand by for camera.
MUDD:
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
DEAN:
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
NEWS REPORTER 3:
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
LAWYER:
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
NEWS REPORTER 4:
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H. R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
NEWS REPORTER 5:
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
(CROWD cheering)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
WH ite HOUSE director:
1 5 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where l was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel, I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
N ixon :
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
(FROST OVER australia THEME music playing)
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
(CH UCKLES)
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
(AU DlENCE LAUGH ing)
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
NOAH :
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
NEWS REPORTER:
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
NEWS REPORTER:
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a. m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
NEWS REPORTER: ...are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
BRENNAN:
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
CHANCELLOR:
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal."
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
GAN NON :
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1 970?
Sir?
GAN NON :
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
SWlFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight, I'd at least talk to him.
N ixon :
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are. I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
director:
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
(PHON E ringing)
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
(stuttering) No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
SWlFTY:
I got $500,000.
is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
birt:
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen !
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
MAN :
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
(FROST LAUGHS) I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
CAROLlN E:
No, thank you.
flight ATTEN DANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
CAROLlN E:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
pilot:
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST:
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
(lN distinct)
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit, I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
FROST:
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
MANOLO:
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
NBC executive:
I\m sorry, David, but it\s a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
N BC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
FROST:
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
FROST:
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 1 0 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 1 2 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
(lNTERRU PTlNG) FROST:
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21 ,000 Americans and a million lndo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(sighs) You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELN lCK:
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man !
How do you know that?
is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with ClA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
RESTON:
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that\s where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
BIRT:
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
birt:
Haldeman.
RESTON :
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON :
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
N ixon ON TAPE:
But they\ve traced the money to him.
RESTON :
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 1 7 people.
birt:
Seventeen?
including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother, I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON :
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years, I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
birt:
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed !
And women all over him !
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLlN E:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book, I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHON E ringing) sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
(STAMMERS)
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 1 7th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine. ln which case, the deal is off.
Fine. ln which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 1 0% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%, I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
birt:
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable loneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
(CH EERlNG)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
KHACH lGlAN :
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
price:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
GAN NON :
People love that story.
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACH lGlAN :
Yeah, right, come on.
REPORTER 1 :
David.
REPORTER 2:
Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 1 :
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST:
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it\ll be that of a cascade of candor.
REPORTER 1 :
\\A cascade of candor\\?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that\s what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
REPORTER 1 :
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
N ixon :
is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
GAN NON :
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
FROST:
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it\s about The Slipper and the Rose.
It\s a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
(ELEVATOR BELL dings) I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
(lNAU DlBLE)
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it. lt's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you !
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
(REPORTERS clamoring)

Mr. Frost, look over here.

Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 3:
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
(REPORTERS clamoring)
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
RESTON :
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
FROST:
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
(CH UCKLES) I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well, I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
(LAUGHS U NCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
(H ESlTATES)
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1 960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
davis:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SN lFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
director:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch !
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House, I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN:
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
N ixon :
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
director:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
N ixon :
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
davis:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON :
Good, good.
N IXON:
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, \\Daddy, you\re the finest man I know.\\
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
is there...
I 'msorry.
is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 1 0:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
REPORTER 1 :
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
(REPORTERS clamoring)
REPORTER 3:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 4:
Mr. President, please!
(WH lSPERlNG) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or ibm?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
(stuttering) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30%% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST:
You seemed very confident last time.
I don\t understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(N lXON CLEARS TH ROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASH ing) lt's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
N ixon :
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
davis:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
(WH lSPERlNG) Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
davis:
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS TH ROAT) three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
... asifthereason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the ClA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
1 5 million rounds of ammunition, 1 50,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts, I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"lf you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
SAWYER:
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS clamoring)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS) lt ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELN lCK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look. lf there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now,
or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(piano playing U PBEAT TU N E)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(singing) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here\s the hook
David !
Patrick.
He\s not a crook He's paid by David
(GU ESTS APPLAU ding)
(playing classical music)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 1 1 -0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(sighs) I see.
is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(sigh ing) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry. I'll call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHON E ringing)
I'll have a cheeseburger.
N ixon:
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
\Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CH UCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
nixon ON TAPE:
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, he is.
N ixon:
I mean, he just isn\t well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don\t want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
mitchell:
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWlN ding)
N ixon:
You open that scab, there\s a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHON E ringing)
Hello?
Jim, it\s David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY crying) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
(knocking ON DOOR)
(knocking contin U ES)
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.

No.
No Frost, no Reston.

(DOOR OPENS)
(lN distinct)
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
davis:
Thirty seconds to tape roll !
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
davis:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice, I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the fbi telephoned me, this was July 6, I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 1 8 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21 , the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white, I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"l know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"lt would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $1 20,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add, I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21 .
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $21 9,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None. I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming !
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation !
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
N IXON:
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
davis:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
BREN NAN :
Get him in here.
davis:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BREN NAN :
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELN lCK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACH lGlAN :
Bob, may I remind you...
birt:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGU ing)
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GAN NON :
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGU ing)
(knocking ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WH lSPERlNG)
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
davis:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(exclaims in disbelief)
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "l did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "l put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "lt's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(sighs) I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon\s face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS clicking)
(REPORTERS clamoring)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGlN E starting)
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(disco music playing)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on. lt'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God !
I almost forgot. I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh !
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON:
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who\ve made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi\s.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing
DAVIS:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
DIRECTOR:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a Iot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd Iike to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN:
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
NIXON:
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to AI Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being AI, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, Iet's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
NIXON:
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
AII right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
DAVIS:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON:
Good, good.
NIXON:
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a Iittle longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd Iike to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I Iook forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER 3:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 4:
Mr. President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'II see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have AIpo.
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a Iittle easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a Iot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST:
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
AII right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, Iike the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a Iittle deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
AII that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(NIXON CLEARS THROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASHING)
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
NIXON:
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
(WHISPERING) Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
DAVIS:
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS THROAT) three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the Iast casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
AII the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
AII right!
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
SAWYER:
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELNICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
AII right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'II infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would Iike you to join us for a Iittle celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd Iike to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(SIGHS) I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(SIGHING) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'II ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'II go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'II call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
I'II have a cheeseburger.
NIXON:
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'II be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
NIXON ON TAPE:
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, he is.
NIXON:
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
MITCHELL:
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON:
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a Iittle light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, Iet's go.
What's that about?
BIRT:
First time he's late.
REPORTER:
Mr. President!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Morning.
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'II know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, Iet me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
AII that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a Iot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the Iaw, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the Iaw?
Oh, my God, we got him.
NIXON:
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, Iet's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
DAVIS:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
BRENNAN:
Get him in here.
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BRENNAN:
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELNICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN:
Bob, may I remind you...
BIRT:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGUING)
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GANNON:
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGUING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WHISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
DAVIS:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)
My goodness.
AII right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would Iike to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(SIGHS)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my Iife.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGINE STARTING)
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover ofTime magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, Iet's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you Iike some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'II be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that Iightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON:
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
Ripped by McArty
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
- Sir?
- You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
- David, how could you have done that?
- What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
- Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
- Haldeman.
- Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
- David.
- Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
- Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
- Here we go.
- Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David!
David!
David!
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
Liar!
Here comes the President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
- Good, good.
- Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President, please!
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
- Focus, sir.
- Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
- Got him.
- Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President!
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
- Oh, my God, we got him.
- I...
Shit!
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
- He's in that truck out there.
- Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness, self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can... really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices... of the Democratic National Committee... in Washington... turns out to be an employee... of President Richard Nixon's re-election... campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised... and arrested yesterday... inside the headquarters of the Democratic
National Committee... in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's... re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse... for the five burglars caught breaking into... the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today... that President Nixon knew about... the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation.
I recall the President telling me... to keep a good list of the press people... giving us trouble... because we will make life difficult for them... after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement... characterizing a president who was easily outraged... over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb... and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy... and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very... essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that... for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation... of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court... has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision... ordering the President of the United States... to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today... that impeachment of the President... by the full House of Representatives... now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency... of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever... resigned from office... in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now.
President Nixon will be appearing... before the people, perhaps for the last time as President... of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office... where so many decisions have been made... that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father... called and he said,
'Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down.'
I was at home with friends, and we were watching... television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else.
I'd been glued to... the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings... night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective... at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction
I imagined I'd feel.
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know... that I would one day be part of the team... that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed... is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led... by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions... whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted... once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage... over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia.
Mr. David Frost.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into... a meat factory in Brisbane... and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men... in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp... really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host... with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that... had won some awards... but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped... by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when... the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds... to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get... the set broken down.
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President... of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history... of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now... from the power of the presidency... to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America... cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when
I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon.
their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait.
that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea... for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims... in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend... and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you... interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political... interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life.
his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone... about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred... confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched... his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California.
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute... attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time... that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda... on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford.
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents... do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon... unto Richard Nixon for all offenses... against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed... the greatest felony... in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates... a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning... of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said,
'Roosevelt had his New Deal,
'Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has... his crooked deal.'
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now... be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes... from the 'stand up and be counted' speech... in 1970?
Sir?
- You know, maybe we're just better off... using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon.
Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet... well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office... as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world... are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit... to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one... you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more... than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get... to put the record straight... and remind people the Nixon years... weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight.
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking... for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were... doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost... would be a whole lot easier than doing it... with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less.
you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table... from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more... and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks.
and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison... into the water... to see if he can miraculously... cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to
Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's... breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them... late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have... the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent
President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No.
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview... and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news.
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night... and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that?
- What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think... he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies... of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia... want you to do another season... of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show... in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success... anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may... never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York... called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen.
You know, I'd be happier... if I heard some kind of vision... that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear... a man doing it... because it would create headlines... or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
'Hello, good evening and welcome.'
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water... on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
'Hello and good evening and welcome.'
You know, I heard an interview with you... recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back... of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person... who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame... without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting... than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are.
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun... our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats... and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa... in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you... first thing in the morning... and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks... to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy... of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host... to interview an American president... with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know.
that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is... very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like... to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs... after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there.
Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit.
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is... you never let a president get behind the wheel... of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything... for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was... a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point... on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours... about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, 'Mr. President, most politicians... 'have tragedy in their early lives.'
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers... to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer... he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets... were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo... at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks... aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies... don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance... this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered... him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian... shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled.
incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making... a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out.
all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program... and syndicate it ourselves, completely... bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own... network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston... and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent... for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol... looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University... of North Carolina... and is writing a book about the criminal... dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear... what you were hoping to achieve... with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours... with the most compelling and controversial politician... of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family... to work on a subject matter... that means more... than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that... without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon... the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking... difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans... and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him... in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him... than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible... to feel anything close to sympathy... for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction.
pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back... and say it was in this interview... that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing... a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown... this entire project is a joke?
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out... on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not... gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man.
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
'British talk show host, 'good with actresses, not so good with... stonewalling presidents.'
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone... is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao... at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president... is the endless round of cocktail parties.
social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you... that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know.
stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and
Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger... and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack.
Reducing the presidency to a series... of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal... doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear.
I didn't want to take any questions... on Watergate, damn it.
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about... is Watergate.
It's as if all my other achievements... have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance... to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping... at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
'Nixon the Man'?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of... biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me.
the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now.
that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms.
rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier... than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where... the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be... any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while... since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting... thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace... of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into
The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into... our research... and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took... the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
Haldeman.
- Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it... into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign... and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really... saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to... legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it... in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him... about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon... was my brother.
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to... foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's... finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
'How far do you take executive privilege... 'before it becomes an undemocratic event?
'
I think you frame the question to him... as a Quaker.
'How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating... an entire people?
'
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic... personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years.
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would... throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration... to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged... abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations... were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close... friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it.
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service.
and they hated me.
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it.
Damn it.
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome... and blue-eyed.
And women all over him.
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same.
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
'When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras... 'for his first interview since he abandoned... the White House, 'he'll be cross-examined as if he were on... the witness stand.
'Frost has hired three crack investigators... 'to help him with the research.
'Clearly the famous TV interviewer... will pull no punches.'
'Crack investigators'?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book.
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a... meeting with Nixon
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the
Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you... for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon... in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel... and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate... be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges... against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach... of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th... and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit... for something in excess of $20 million... in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate... that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75%... he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
'Drone on'?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're... talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did... in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right... at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10%... where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%.
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer... to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations... many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say 'performer'?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said 'performer.'
Not 'journalist' or 'interviewer'?
No.
He said 'performer.'
Out of curiosity, where are you at this... moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness... of the wilderness I am about to... be dispatched to... by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right.
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think... you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
David.
- Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested... that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting... his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of... a cascade of candor.
'A cascade of candor'?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase... that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together... as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
'Why didn't you burn the tapes?
'
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no.
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead... of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set... specific times to deal with certain subjects... if you're just going to ignore it... right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you.
We were sadly unable to do the taping... at Casa Pacifica... because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more... modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican... businessman.
Right here.
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir.
Here we go.
- Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David.
David.
David.
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands.
Liar.
Here comes the President.
Mr. President.
Mr. President.
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture... be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen... him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done... to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for... you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say... how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business... of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well.
I'd just like to say how pleased we are... that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here.
if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made... an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know.
when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history... with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate... with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip... cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio.
well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief... and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field... can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be... covering a lot of subjects... in a great deal of detail over the course... of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely... out of context... by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American... and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch.
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised... by your question... since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement.
I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have... a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize... is that the taping system in the White House... was set up by my predecessor.
President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having... a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was... a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House.
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all.
but the former President.
President Johnson, had repeatedly said... how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels... the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that... all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man... that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through... the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is... almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable... speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our 'ballsy' opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats... that were still against impeachment had... had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, 'Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency.'
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget... he had the most to gain personally... from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that... we were gonna win the impeachment vote,
and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to... stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just... introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting... valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to... get something... out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point.
a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail... him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled.
even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three... in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary... final days, it seems your most emotional moment came... in that heart-to-heart you had... with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment... of your career?
Good, good.
- Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional... a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say... what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter
Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings... when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, 'Daddy, you're the finest man I know.'
'Daddy, you're the finest man I know'?
'And whatever you do, I will support you.
'You just gotta go through the fire.
you know, a little longer.'
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce... about some of the great decisions that... we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that
I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough... decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room... at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
'Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
'Neither of us is particularly orthodox, 'but I'd like to think that each of us... in our own way... 'has a deep religious sensitivity.
'So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment... of silent prayer?
'
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front... of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation
Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again.
and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning... to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up.
you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
Mr. President.
- Mr. President.
Mr. President.
Mr. President, please.
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in... our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner... rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare... the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to... get back to LA... to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone.
Great work.
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless.
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors... or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts... came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically... fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional... on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart... like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising... sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David... over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure... that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying... for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than... just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden... change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s... audience share, minimum.
Jimmy.
Yes.
Yes, back again, like... the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review... yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving.
23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance... before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise... the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there... with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor.
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
Focus, sir.
- Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it... on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four.
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House... than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged... with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there... had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized... how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see... if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won... some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence... suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition.
150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed... right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications... you gave for the incursion... was the supposed existence of... the 'headquarters of the entire Communist military... operation in South Vietnam,' a sort of 'bamboo Pentagon' which proved... not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment... and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge... that would lead to civil war...
All right.
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question... do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war.
yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced... with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts.
I remembered the construction worker... in Philadelphia, because he came up to me... and he said, 'Sir, I got only one criticism... of that Cambodia thing.
'If you'd gone in earlier, 'you might have captured the gun... 'that killed my boy three months ago.'
So you're asking me, do I regret... going into Cambodia?
No.
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
Got him.
- Safe.
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out.
you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me.
begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman... would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust... personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him.
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What 'revolution,' David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim... the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors 'bombing' and 'assaulting' police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting... peacefully and legitimately... against the Vietnam War.
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking... into journalists' homes... was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly.
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members... of the crew say... they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today.
he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential.
for Christ's sake.
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed... to Europe... when he traveled?
I do.
Well, it's irrelevant.
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote... that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say 'talk show host'?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying... to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of... pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No.
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks... we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel... for the next five days, we all go our separate ways... over Easter.
But before we go.
Caroline and I... would like you... to join us for a little celebratory dinner... at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working... at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob.
I'd like to celebrate my birthday... with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most... extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around... for future generations... of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David.
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews... have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped... the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show... will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever... see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me.
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese... and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there... whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing... for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle
Watergate's gonna determine... whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation... for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around... to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff... in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university... full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy.
isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards... or column inches are written about you... or how high the elected office is for me.
it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted.
really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately... just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy... place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt.
A place the snobs always told us... that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried... so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that.
We're not gonna let that happen.
either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards... and power and glory.
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke.
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company... but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused... and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night.
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted... person you have... in the Immigration Service... that they are to look over all the activities... at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send... their teams in to see... whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that... we just feel that it would be very detrimental... to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be... in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember... you mentioned... going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading... this end, and you remember that hunch you had... about the meeting... between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President.
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll.
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call.
it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year... in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice... or were part of a conspiracy to cover up... or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term... 'obstruction of justice.'
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute... with regard to the obstruction... of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it... doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have... a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests... of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences... of your actions would have been... that two of the convicted burglars... would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or... obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows.
Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice.
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me.
this was July 6.
I said, 'Pat, you go right ahead... with your investigation.'
That's hardly what you'd call... obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks... prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately... trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice... is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail.
that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there.
Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence... is because 18 and a half minutes... of the conversation with Bob Haldeman... from this June period... have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate... oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous... and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better... than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers... found it in Washington... where it's available to anyone who consults... the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of... the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier... clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, 'This whole... investigation rests... 'unless one of the seven begins to talk.
'That's the problem.'
Well, what do we mean when we say... 'one of the seven beginning to talk'?
Then moving on to a conversation you had... with John Dean... on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white.
I picked out, and these are your words, one, 'You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
'I know where it could be gotten.'
Two, 'Your major guy to keep under control... is Hunt.'
Three, 'Don't we have to handle... the Hunt situation?
'
Four, 'Get the million bucks.
'It would seem to me that would be worthwhile.'
Five, 'Don't you agree that you'd better get... the Hunt thing going?
'
Six, 'First you've got the Hunt problem.
'That ought to be handled.' Seven, 'The money... can be provided.
'Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it.'
Eight, 'We've no choice with Hunt... 'but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?
'
Nine, 'Christ, turn over any cash... we've got.'
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me... that someone running a cover-up... couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that.
could they?
Look, let me just stop you now... right there, because you're doing something here... which I am not doing, and I will not do... throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add.
I have participated in all these interviews... without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained... that you knew nothing about any of this... until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer... came to Washington... to start the raising of $219,000... of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe... that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for... humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people... with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths... with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees... are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements... to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones... really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police... and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office... and said, 'Hey, there's the two men.
'Haul them down to the dock, 'fingerprint them and then throw them... in the can.'
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman.
I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go.
that became overwhelming.
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher.
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes... that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them... because they're in the greater interests... of the nation.
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best... interests of the nation... and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it.
that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else... shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up... and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
- I...
Shit.
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
- Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment... in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged... the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview.
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you... give him a week off?
Give him a year off.
Give him a fucking massage.
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that... if you were going to make some kind of... emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment... to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you... how crucially important this moment is... and how many potentially devastating consequences... unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty... of time to cook up... some sort of slippery new bullshit.
so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about... the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering... would you go further than 'mistakes'?
The word that seems not enough... for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there... are three things... that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that 'I did abuse the power
I had as President.'
And thirdly, 'I put the American people... 'through two years of needless agony, 'and I apologize for that.' And I know... how difficult it is... for anyone, especially you, but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards... of excellence... that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war... against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility... and I was involved in a cover-up.
as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign... the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No.
Never.
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place.
I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all.
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people... that ought to get into government, but now they think, 'It's all too corrupt,' and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down, and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me... for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin... or deception of television... is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric... as he was after the interviews, or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked... and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood... the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day... in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee... or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness.
self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would... not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience... for a news program... in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine... and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition... and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President... just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente... to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises... and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews... as they went out, but they tell me that they were... a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive... about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else... from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said... 'sons of bitches,' but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar... the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God.
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh.
Say, David, you think I could speak to you.
privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people.
and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life... that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician... and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney... welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved... the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy... is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix 'gate.'
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can... really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices... of the Democratic National Committee... in Washington... turns out to be an employee... of President Richard Nixon's re-election... campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised... and arrested yesterday... inside the headquarters of the Democratic
National Committee... in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's... re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse... for the five burglars caught breaking into... the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today... that President Nixon knew about... the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation.
I recall the President telling me... to keep a good list of the press people... giving us trouble... because we will make life difficult for them... after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement... characterizing a president who was easily outraged... over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb... and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy... and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very... essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that... for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation... of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court... has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision... ordering the President of the United States... to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today... that impeachment of the President... by the full House of Representatives... now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency... of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever... resigned from office... in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now.
President Nixon will be appearing... before the people, perhaps for the last time as President... of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office... where so many decisions have been made... that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father... called and he said,
'Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down.'
I was at home with friends, and we were watching... television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else.
I'd been glued to... the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings... night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective... at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction
I imagined I'd feel.
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know... that I would one day be part of the team... that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed... is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led... by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions... whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted... once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage... over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia.
Mr. David Frost.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into... a meat factory in Brisbane... and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men... in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp... really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host... with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that... had won some awards... but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped... by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when... the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds... to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get... the set broken down.
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President... of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history... of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now... from the power of the presidency... to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America... cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when
I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon.
their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait.
that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea... for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims... in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend... and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you... interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political... interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life.
his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone... about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred... confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched... his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California.
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute... attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time... that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda... on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford.
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents... do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon... unto Richard Nixon for all offenses... against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed... the greatest felony... in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates... a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning... of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said,
'Roosevelt had his New Deal,
'Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has... his crooked deal.'
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now... be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes... from the 'stand up and be counted' speech... in 1970?
Sir?
- You know, maybe we're just better off... using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon.
Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet... well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office... as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world... are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit... to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one... you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more... than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get... to put the record straight... and remind people the Nixon years... weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight.
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking... for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were... doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost... would be a whole lot easier than doing it... with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less.
you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table... from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more... and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks.
and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison... into the water... to see if he can miraculously... cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to
Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's... breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them... late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have... the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent
President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No.
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview... and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news.
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night... and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that?
- What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think... he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies... of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia... want you to do another season... of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show... in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success... anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may... never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York... called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen.
You know, I'd be happier... if I heard some kind of vision... that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear... a man doing it... because it would create headlines... or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
'Hello, good evening and welcome.'
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water... on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
'Hello and good evening and welcome.'
You know, I heard an interview with you... recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back... of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person... who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame... without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting... than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are.
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun... our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats... and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa... in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you... first thing in the morning... and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks... to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy... of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host... to interview an American president... with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know.
that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is... very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like... to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs... after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there.
Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit.
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is... you never let a president get behind the wheel... of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything... for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was... a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point... on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours... about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, 'Mr. President, most politicians... 'have tragedy in their early lives.'
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers... to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer... he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets... were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo... at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks... aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies... don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance... this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered... him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian... shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled.
incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making... a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out.
all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program... and syndicate it ourselves, completely... bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own... network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston... and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent... for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol... looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University... of North Carolina... and is writing a book about the criminal... dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear... what you were hoping to achieve... with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours... with the most compelling and controversial politician... of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family... to work on a subject matter... that means more... than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that... without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon... the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking... difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans... and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him... in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him... than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible... to feel anything close to sympathy... for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction.
pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back... and say it was in this interview... that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing... a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown... this entire project is a joke?
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out... on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not... gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man.
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
'British talk show host, 'good with actresses, not so good with... stonewalling presidents.'
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone... is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao... at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president... is the endless round of cocktail parties.
social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you... that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know.
stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and
Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger... and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack.
Reducing the presidency to a series... of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal... doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear.
I didn't want to take any questions... on Watergate, damn it.
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about... is Watergate.
It's as if all my other achievements... have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance... to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping... at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
'Nixon the Man'?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of... biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me.
the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now.
that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms.
rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier... than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where... the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be... any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while... since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting... thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace... of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into
The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into... our research... and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took... the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
Haldeman.
- Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it... into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign... and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really... saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to... legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it... in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him... about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon... was my brother.
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to... foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's... finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
'How far do you take executive privilege... 'before it becomes an undemocratic event?
'
I think you frame the question to him... as a Quaker.
'How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating... an entire people?
'
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic... personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years.
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would... throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration... to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged... abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations... were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close... friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it.
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service.
and they hated me.
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it.
Damn it.
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome... and blue-eyed.
And women all over him.
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same.
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
'When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras... 'for his first interview since he abandoned... the White House, 'he'll be cross-examined as if he were on... the witness stand.
'Frost has hired three crack investigators... 'to help him with the research.
'Clearly the famous TV interviewer... will pull no punches.'
'Crack investigators'?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book.
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a... meeting with Nixon
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the
Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you... for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon... in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel... and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate... be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges... against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach... of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th... and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit... for something in excess of $20 million... in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate... that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75%... he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
'Drone on'?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're... talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did... in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right... at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10%... where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%.
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer... to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations... many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say 'performer'?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said 'performer.'
Not 'journalist' or 'interviewer'?
No.
He said 'performer.'
Out of curiosity, where are you at this... moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness... of the wilderness I am about to... be dispatched to... by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right.
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think... you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
David.
- Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested... that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting... his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of... a cascade of candor.
'A cascade of candor'?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase... that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together... as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
'Why didn't you burn the tapes?
'
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no.
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead... of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set... specific times to deal with certain subjects... if you're just going to ignore it... right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you.
We were sadly unable to do the taping... at Casa Pacifica... because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more... modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican... businessman.
Right here.
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir.
Here we go.
- Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David.
David.
David.
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands.
Liar.
Here comes the President.
Mr. President.
Mr. President.
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture... be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen... him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done... to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for... you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say... how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business... of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well.
I'd just like to say how pleased we are... that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here.
if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made... an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know.
when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history... with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate... with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip... cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio.
well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief... and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field... can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be... covering a lot of subjects... in a great deal of detail over the course... of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely... out of context... by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American... and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch.
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised... by your question... since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement.
I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have... a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize... is that the taping system in the White House... was set up by my predecessor.
President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having... a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was... a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House.
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all.
but the former President.
President Johnson, had repeatedly said... how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels... the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that... all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man... that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through... the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is... almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable... speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our 'ballsy' opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats... that were still against impeachment had... had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, 'Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency.'
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget... he had the most to gain personally... from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that... we were gonna win the impeachment vote,
and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to... stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just... introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting... valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to... get something... out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point.
a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail... him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled.
even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three... in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary... final days, it seems your most emotional moment came... in that heart-to-heart you had... with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment... of your career?
Good, good.
- Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional... a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say... what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter
Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings... when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, 'Daddy, you're the finest man I know.'
'Daddy, you're the finest man I know'?
'And whatever you do, I will support you.
'You just gotta go through the fire.
you know, a little longer.'
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce... about some of the great decisions that... we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that
I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough... decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room... at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
'Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
'Neither of us is particularly orthodox, 'but I'd like to think that each of us... in our own way... 'has a deep religious sensitivity.
'So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment... of silent prayer?
'
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front... of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation
Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again.
and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning... to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up.
you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
Mr. President.
- Mr. President.
Mr. President.
Mr. President, please.
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in... our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner... rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare... the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to... get back to LA... to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone.
Great work.
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless.
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors... or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts... came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically... fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional... on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart... like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising... sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David... over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure... that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying... for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than... just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden... change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s... audience share, minimum.
Jimmy.
Yes.
Yes, back again, like... the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review... yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving.
23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance... before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise... the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there... with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor.
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
Focus, sir.
- Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it... on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four.
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House... than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged... with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there... had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized... how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see... if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won... some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence... suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition.
150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed... right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications... you gave for the incursion... was the supposed existence of... the 'headquarters of the entire Communist military... operation in South Vietnam,' a sort of 'bamboo Pentagon' which proved... not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment... and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge... that would lead to civil war...
All right.
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question... do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war.
yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced... with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts.
I remembered the construction worker... in Philadelphia, because he came up to me... and he said, 'Sir, I got only one criticism... of that Cambodia thing.
'If you'd gone in earlier, 'you might have captured the gun... 'that killed my boy three months ago.'
So you're asking me, do I regret... going into Cambodia?
No.
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
Got him.
- Safe.
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out.
you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me.
begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman... would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust... personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him.
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What 'revolution,' David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim... the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors 'bombing' and 'assaulting' police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting... peacefully and legitimately... against the Vietnam War.
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking... into journalists' homes... was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly.
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members... of the crew say... they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today.
he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential.
for Christ's sake.
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed... to Europe... when he traveled?
I do.
Well, it's irrelevant.
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote... that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say 'talk show host'?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying... to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of... pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No.
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks... we're gonna fail, they better leave now,
or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel... for the next five days, we all go our separate ways... over Easter.
But before we go.
Caroline and I... would like you... to join us for a little celebratory dinner... at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working... at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob.
I'd like to celebrate my birthday... with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most... extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around... for future generations... of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David.
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews... have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped... the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show... will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever... see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me.
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese... and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there... whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing... for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle
Watergate's gonna determine... whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation... for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around... to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff... in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university... full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy.
isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards... or column inches are written about you... or how high the elected office is for me.
it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted.
really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately... just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy... place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt.
A place the snobs always told us... that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried... so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that.
We're not gonna let that happen.
either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards... and power and glory.
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke.
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company... but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused... and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night.
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted... person you have... in the Immigration Service... that they are to look over all the activities... at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send... their teams in to see... whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that... we just feel that it would be very detrimental... to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be... in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember... you mentioned... going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading... this end, and you remember that hunch you had... about the meeting... between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President.
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll.
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call.
it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year... in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice... or were part of a conspiracy to cover up... or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term... 'obstruction of justice.'
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute... with regard to the obstruction... of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it... doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have... a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests... of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences... of your actions would have been... that two of the convicted burglars... would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or... obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows.
Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice.
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me.
this was July 6.
I said, 'Pat, you go right ahead... with your investigation.'
That's hardly what you'd call... obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks... prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately... trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice... is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail.
that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there.
Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence... is because 18 and a half minutes... of the conversation with Bob Haldeman... from this June period... have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate... oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous... and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better... than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers... found it in Washington... where it's available to anyone who consults... the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of... the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier... clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, 'This whole... investigation rests... 'unless one of the seven begins to talk.
'That's the problem.'
Well, what do we mean when we say... 'one of the seven beginning to talk'?
Then moving on to a conversation you had... with John Dean... on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white.
I picked out, and these are your words, one, 'You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
'I know where it could be gotten.'
Two, 'Your major guy to keep under control... is Hunt.'
Three, 'Don't we have to handle... the Hunt situation?
'
Four, 'Get the million bucks.
'It would seem to me that would be worthwhile.'
Five, 'Don't you agree that you'd better get... the Hunt thing going?
'
Six, 'First you've got the Hunt problem.
'That ought to be handled.' Seven, 'The money... can be provided.
'Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it.'
Eight, 'We've no choice with Hunt... 'but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?
'
Nine, 'Christ, turn over any cash... we've got.'
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me... that someone running a cover-up... couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that.
could they?
Look, let me just stop you now... right there, because you're doing something here... which I am not doing, and I will not do... throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add.
I have participated in all these interviews... without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained... that you knew nothing about any of this... until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer... came to Washington... to start the raising of $219,000... of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe... that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for... humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people... with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths... with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees... are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements... to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones... really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police... and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office... and said, 'Hey, there's the two men.
'Haul them down to the dock, 'fingerprint them and then throw them... in the can.'
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman.
I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go.
that became overwhelming.
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher.
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes... that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them... because they're in the greater interests... of the nation.
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best... interests of the nation... and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it.
that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else... shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up... and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
- I...
Shit.
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
- Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment... in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged... the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview.
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you... give him a week off?
Give him a year off.
Give him a fucking massage.
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that... if you were going to make some kind of... emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment... to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you... how crucially important this moment is... and how many potentially devastating consequences... unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty... of time to cook up... some sort of slippery new bullshit.
so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about... the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering... would you go further than 'mistakes'?
The word that seems not enough... for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there... are three things... that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that 'I did abuse the power
I had as President.'
And thirdly, 'I put the American people... 'through two years of needless agony, 'and I apologize for that.' And I know... how difficult it is... for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president,
ones that did not meet the standards... of excellence... that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war... against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility... and I was involved in a cover-up.
as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign... the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No.
Never.
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place.
I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all.
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people... that ought to get into government, but now they think, 'It's all too corrupt,' and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me... for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin... or deception of television... is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric... as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked... and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood... the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day... in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee... or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness.
self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would... not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience... for a news program... in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine... and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition... and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President... just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente... to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises... and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews... as they went out, but they tell me that they were... a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive... about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else... from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said... 'sons of bitches,' but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar... the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God.
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh.
Say, David, you think I could speak to you.
privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people.
and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life... that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician... and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney... welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved... the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy... is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix 'gate.'

A controversial day in politics;
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic national Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-eIection campaign committee;
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic national Committee in Washington;
And guess what else he is;
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-eIection campaign committee;

At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election;
NEWS REPORTER 3;
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a charles CoIson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats;

Good morning;
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is carl Stern, who has that ruling;
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero;
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes;
(CROWD CHEERING)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion;
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty;
These are, with no serious doubt, the Iast hours of the 37th presidency of the United States;
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history;
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the Iast time as President of the United States;
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR:
15 seconds, Mr;
President;
Okay, that's five, four, three;
Good evening;
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation;
I remember exactly where I was;
My father called;
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now;
Richard Nixon's going down;"
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home;
We stayed up and, Iike everyone else, I'd been glued to the select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night;
And then finally, it had come to this;
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow;
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt;
There was no apology;
little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology;
NIXON:
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body;
I have never been a quitter;
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life;
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us;
He understood television;

He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network;
He ended up taking it down to australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned;
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne GooIagong;
We'II see you then;
God bless;
Great show, David;
Thanks, Noah;
NOAH:
Come and look at this;
Nixon leaving the White House;
NEWS REPORTER;
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast ellipse south of the White House before;
What, this is live?
Yeah;
NEWS REPORTER;
But those were triumphs;
This is not;
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a;m;
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast;
half his audience is still asleep;
AII right, you blokes, Iet's get the set broken down;
NEWS REPORTER; ;are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country;
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in california;
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
worldwide;
BRENNAN;
I remember his face;
Staring out the window;
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gIoated;
Hippies, draft dodgers, diIettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam;
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman;
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview;
Fish and chips, please;
And in a moment;
well, it's too late now;
It's done;
I've called his people;
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please;
And made an offer;
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters;
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side;
So who is it?
Richard Nixon;
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
well, come on, don't look like that;
well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees;
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before;
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive Iook-back over his life, his presidency;
And?
And what?
Come on, David;
surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession;
A full, no-hoIds-barred confession;
well, we'II get that, too;
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John;
Just think of the numbers it wouId get;
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million;
But in the end, David heard nothing;
And soon after arriving in california,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis;
I think it was around this time that GeraId Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon;
Now therefore, I, gerald R;
Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States;
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial;
It was like he slipped out the back door;
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon;
CHANCELLOR;
One telegram from Virginia said, "RooseveIt had his New deal,
"Truman had his Fair deal, now Ford has his crooked deal; "
There was no deal, period;
I don't think the truth will ever come out;
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known;
GANNON:
So how do we want to address the college protests?
well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole lincoln memorial memo;
SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing;
Mr;
President, Swifty Lazar is here;
Okay;
No, no, stick around;
You're gonna get a kick out of this;
This is my literary agent from hollywood;
Hygiene obsessive;
Mr;
President, good to see you;
Nice to see you;
These are folks helping me with my book;
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar;
Nice to meet you;
Miss Sawyer;
pleasure;
Mr;
Gannon;
Okay, that's it;
I'II see you after lunch;
SWIFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you;
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God;
I despise that game;
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room;
Never retire, Mr;
Lazar;
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired;
No purpose;
What makes life mean something is purpose;
A goal;
A battle;
A struggle;
well, even if you don't win it;
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved;
well, they were wrong;
That was the lowest I got;
well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy;
How to spend $2 million, 2;3 to be precise;
It's what I got for your memoirs;
well, thank you;
Eh;
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted;
That book is important to me;
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad;
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at Ieast talk to him;
NIXON:
Who?
David Frost;
english talk show guy;
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview;
No;
well, we didn't get back to him;
frankly, we didn't find him appropriate;
well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS;
We are;
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike wallace;
It would, but it wouId have a Iot less, you know, credibility;
True, true;
could probably get more money;
really?
Look;
We'II always have 350 on the table from CBS;
But if I couId get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass;
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now;
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped;
We buried him alive, and he walked free;
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more;
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes;
My name is David Frost;
DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut;
Thank you;
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point;
To assess that, you might call them
Iate at night or at the weekend;
If they take the call, you know they're desperate;
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand;
(PHONE RINGING)
hello?
Mr;
Frost?
Irving Lazar;
Who?
Swifty Lazar;
I represent President Nixon;
What time is it?
Bad time?
(STUTTERING) No!
Not at all;
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea;
really?
well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake;
SWIFTY;
I got $500,000;
Is that good?
Mr;
President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview;
It's unprecedented;
Yeah?
well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None;
It'II be a big wet kiss;
This guy'II be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'II pitch puffbaIIs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege;
well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6;
BIRT:
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000;
That's a fortune;
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money;
My God;
Most Americans think he belongs in jail;
You're making him a rich man;
plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks;
They're just jealous;
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism;
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle;
No syndication, no advance sales;
No advance sales, no commercials;
No commercials, no revenue;
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it;
Your career's in great shape;
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows;
Isn't it true that channel Nine in australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes;
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and australia;
This would be;
What?
You wouldn't understand, John;
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable;
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else;
And the emptiness when it's gone;
And the sickening thought that it may never come back;
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's;
Ordinary mortals can't get a table;
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview;
MAN:
Excuse me, Mr;
Frost;
I'd heard you were going to be here;
would you mind?
Of course;
But I don't;
I just hear a man doing it because it wouId create headlines or give him a place at the top table;
And that is what makes me nervous;
And you do nervous so beautifully, John;
"hello, good evening and welcome;"
(FROST LAUGHS)
I don't actually say that;
hello, Mr;
Frost;
Champagne?
CAROLINE:
No, thank you;
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes;
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly;
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too;
Like the Viennese serve coffee;
well, I've never been to Vienna;
Oh;
well, you'd Iike it;
It's like Paris without the French;
What's your name?
caroline;
David;
Yes, I know;
David Frost;
"hello and good evening and welcome;"
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio;
You were giving it from the back of your RoIIs-Royce;
bentley;
On the phone;
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in;
really?
Mmm;
You and VidaI Sassoon;
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality;
How kind;
Mmm-hmm;
And that you fly around a great deal;
well, that's true;
Why?
I Iike to keep busy;
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still;
You know, you have very sad eyes;
Do I?
Mmm;
Has anyone told you that before?
No;
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit;
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions;
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking;
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los angeles;
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'II be landing very shortly;
Thank you;
CAROLINE:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon;
really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice;
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
actually, no;
In his rather smart beachside villa in california;
really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous;
You can come if you'd Iike;
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that;
PILO T;
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival;
well, I'II get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone;
Oh;
He did, too;
Money no object;
Everything gIittered and was golden;
well, on the outside;
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews;
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview;
Look, we love your work as an entertainer;
That Guinness show?
Love it;
You're a funny guy;
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach;
I know you're very busy;
I'm not gonna keep you from it;
Thank you for coming in;
I'm gonna have to get back to you;
Okay, thank you so much for your time;
David, good luck;
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me;
You know, that would have meant;
Thanks;
;admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure;
FROST:
There you are;
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself;
(INDISTINCT)
well;
You found it okay;
Yes, thank you;
pleasure to meet you, Mr;
Frost;
And you, sir;
May I present caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing;
hello;
Your house is very beautiful;
really;
Very romantic;
well, thank you;
And my producer, John Birt;
Nice to meet you;
How do you do?
This is Mr;
Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan;
Now, Miss Cushing, would you Iike to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please;
I'd love that;
Thank you;
Come on in;
This is my office;
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit;
Yeah;
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there;
We talked for nine hours straight;
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a lincoln specially made;
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather;
well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas;
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever;
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, Iet alone drive;
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the Iast thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm;
He crashed into curbs;
He went over speed bumps;
He went twice around my whole estate;
finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea;
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills;
He said, "Mr;
President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives;"
well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis;
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks;
He was a sad man and a noble adversary;
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader;
They never know when they're being taped;
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
until March;
I Iook forward to it;
well, thank you, Mr;
President;
So do I;
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before;
I guess that's what this is;
FROST:
Yeah, well, not really;
Of course it is;
And I Iike that;
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred;
Mr;
Frost, there's still the small matter of the;
Of course;
I do beg your pardon;
Right; $200,000;
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket;
well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep;
Made out in the name of?
Irving paul Lazar;
Richard M;
Nixon;
Here you go;
MANOLO:
Okay, smile;
There;
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard;
well, actually, I'm living in Monte carlo at the moment;
really?
Yes;
Goodbye, Mr;
President;
Hey;
Take my advice;
You should marry that woman;
Yes;
lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco;
They pay no taxes there;
Bye-bye;
Goodbye;
I bet you it did;
What?
Come out of his own pocket;
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye;
well, I hear the networks aren't biting;
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know;
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen;
really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct;
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea;
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No;
italian;
No laces;
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that;
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir;
You do?
Yeah;
personally, I find those italian shoes very effeminate;
Yes, quite right;
NBC EXECUTIVE;
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no;
Try to look at it from our point of view;
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see;
well, I'm sorry you feel this way;
obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake;
NBC;
well, that's the networks out, all of them;
well, that's the end of that, then;
I'm sorry, David;
Not so fast;
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks;
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night;
Hey, Bob;
FROST:
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in;
David's on the phone;
FROST:
No, never been done before;
Historic stuff;
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back;
Yeah?
Yeah;
David, I'd Iike you to meet Jim Reston and Bob ZeInick, our two prospective corner men;
delighted to meet you;
Come on in;
Make yourselves at home;
Bob's been Washington correspondent for public Radio for the past 10 years;
Moving to ABC in the new year;
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio;
Jim here teaches at the University of North carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon;
Second on the subject;
Fourth;
well, delighted to have you both aboard;
actually, before I sign on, I would Iike to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview;
What I want to achieve?
Yeah;
Jim, well, I've secured 1 2 taping days;
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times;
Isn't that enough?
well, not for me;
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my Iife;
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me;
(INTERRUPTING) FROST:
No, all right;
well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd Iike to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had;
Of course, we'II be asking difficult questions;
difficult questions;
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration;
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon;
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(SIGHS) You know;
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon;
He devaIued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma;
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple;
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it;
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all;
Did you know that Mike wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around capitol hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELNICK:
Come on;
Jim, come on;
Thanks for that, Jim;
could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable;
I'm sorry, Bob;
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you;
I mean, some of us actually want this job;
I want it, too, if it's done right;
well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
little Lord FauntIeroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the;
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike wallace doing a piece on this?
apparently;
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant;
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents;"
That's the general idea, yeah;
Right;
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that;
well, Bob's obviously a pro;
What are we gonna do about Reston?
well, the man's an idiot;
He's overemotionaI;
Send him home;
well, I think he should stay;
Why?
I liked his passion;
He will drive us all bloody mad;
well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told;
He stays;
I took my seat next to Mrs;
Mao at the banquet table;
Now, one of the challenges of Iife as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets;
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either;
No;
particularly not in Mandarin;
So Mrs;
Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another;
And then across the table, Mrs;
Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too;
And then further down, Dr;
Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now;
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes;
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks;
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist;
well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think;
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there;
He got the money;
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out;
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March;
really?
Now, that's terrific;
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%;
Just one of four 90-minute shows;
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign policy, and Nixon the Man;
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece;
I can see it now;
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died;
Spare me;
still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr;
President, it's fantastic;
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir;
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation;
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected;
You think?
I'm certain;
It would be so good to go back to where the action is;
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack;
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
well, that's nothing to worry about, sir;
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations;
That stuff's been combed over a million times;
No one has pinned anything on you;
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record;
I'm gonna start doing my homework;
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is;
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The beverly hilton;
The beverly hilton, you say;
well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in;
Cubans with CIA training;
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke;
Yes, sir;
RESTON;
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The beverly hilton;
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews;
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously;
BIRT;
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe;
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that HaIdeman?
BIRT:
HaIdeman;
RESTON:
HaIdeman;
And EhrIichman, too;
I always get the Germans mixed up;
I'm a little confused by that;
What is HaIdeman's official;
hello, darling;
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections;
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power;
And David, we never really saw much of David;
RESTON:
AII right, so what about the Huston plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks;
essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks;
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question;
Wiretapping students;
NIXON ON TAPE;
But they've traced the money to him;
RESTON:
Opening people's mail;
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 1 7 people;
BIRT:
Seventeen?
including his own brother;
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too;
RESTON:
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering;
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution;
And that's Liddy, right?
delivery courtesy of Nate 'n AI's finest dell selection;
We're going to need napkins;
We'd better have some napkins;
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker;
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on;
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality;
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick;
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals;
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be;
BIRT:
Okay, the White House taping system;
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems;
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them;
So did Kennedy's;
Huston plan;
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power;
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse;
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy;
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam;
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard MiIhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look;
Look;
Now I'm sweating;
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and bIue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything;
Had a go at Checkers once;
The poor little bitch was never the same!
gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press;
CAROLINE:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'II be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand;
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research;
"clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches;"
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain CoIson;
You know, charles CoIson?
His darkest henchman?
CoIson, right;
CoIson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHONE RINGING) sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript;
But if you gave me a week back in the federal Courthouse library;
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long;
I think this is really good stuff, Dave;
would there be something I couId help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him;
We're gonna have to take him by surprise;
Don't worry, Jim;
We'II get him anyway;
Hang on a second;
David, Jack Brennan;
He sounds a little emotional;
I'II take it in here;
He'II be right with you;
Yeah;
Jack;
Watergate;
Yes, Jack;
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word;
well, I believe it's a Iarge hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack;
You know what I'm talking about;
For the interviews;
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative;
(STAMMERS)
hold on a minute;
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct;
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement;
Okay;
How would you define Watergate?
well, that it covers just that;
The Watergate break-in of June 1 7th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation;
Fine;
In which case, the deal is off;
Fine;
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings;
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time;
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential;
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ;
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here;
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time;
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it;
You goddamn media people;
You are so smug;
well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my Iife;
Prick;
Look at you;
Gorgeous;
Good night, sweet princes;
Cheerio;
Bye;
See you in the morning;
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend;
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The slipper and the Rose;
The cinderella movie?
Yeah;
David's the executive producer;
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
BIRT:
Don't worry;
David is a performer of the highest caliber;
He's been in these pressure situations many times before;
Come the hour, he'II be fine;
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah;
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer;"
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No;
He said "performer;"
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
PsychicaIIy?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable loneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues;
(CHEERING)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev;
Just go right!
KHACHIGIAN:
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir;
PRICE:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale;
Excuse me, sir;
Something I think you should see;
GANNON:
people love that story;
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACHIGIAN:
Yeah, right, come on;

Mr;
Frost;
REPORTER 1;
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'II be too soft on the President;
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST;
well, I shall say so again and again;
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall;
I'm hoping that it'II be that of a cascade of candor;
REPORTER 1;
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'II get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you;
REPORTER 1;
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow;
Started life as a comic, you know;
NIXON:
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm;
almost married Diahann carroll;
Who?
GANNON:
The singer;
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir;
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations;
Okay;
Let's get back to work;
FROST;
That's fact, this is fiction;
So now it's about The slipper and the Rose;
It's a cracker of a movie;
I hope you'II all come and see it, and;
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee;
Just don't drink any more;
(INAUDIBLE)
Good luck;
Thank you;
I'II be thinking of you;
Dick;
Wait;
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea;
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No;
Fuck;
please, God, no!
You can't;
David, you can't do that;
It would be a disaster;
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time;
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
gloves off;
I Iike it;
It's ballsy;
strategically, it'II give us the upper hand;
It's insanely risky;
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it;
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local republican businessman;

You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh;
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned;
The least he could do is look ravaged;
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake;
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand;

I got you guys set up back here;
Now this is your green room;
And the President will be on the large monitor;
Craft services is that way;
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr;
President?
Yeah;
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs;
Nixon's recovery;
well, thank you;
It's true;
She's much better now;
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards;
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together;
Thank you;
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle;
well;
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on;
Come on, it's just between us;
Very well;
Two million;
Two million?
Jeez;
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur;
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something;
You raised it all now?
(HESITATES)
Not quite;
But we're getting there;
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees;
well, not quite everyone;
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera;
Excuse me;
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may;
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr;
President;
contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it;
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together;
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration;
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960;
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency;
people who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won;
But television and the cIose-up, they create their own sets of meanings;
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed;
Sixty seconds, everyone;
You trim yours?
No;
No, of course not;
Yeah, you're Iight-skinned;
Yeah;
You got blue eyes;
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine;
No, not that I'm aware;
You were obviously born to be on the tube;

Those shoes;
They're italian, aren't they?

Yeah, that's interesting;
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No;
well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know;
ManoIo, just check my collar, will you?
DIRECTOR:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two;
Cue David;
And;
Mr;
President;
Now, we're going to be covering a Iot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd Iike to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask;
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
well, Mr;
Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session;
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now;
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual;
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system;
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it wouId be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way;
BRENNAN;
well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face;
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab;
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along;
You could see it in Frost's face;
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer;
NIXON:
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House;
They're less likely to offer that advice;
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers;
So much for our "ballsy" opening;
So when did you actually decide;
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good;
That's good;
I remember exactly;
It was july 23;
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House;
That night I said to AI Haig, "well, that's it;
There goes the presidency;"
And, of course, you know, being AI, he tried to talk me out of it;
And Vice President Ford, I mean, Iet's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably;
John, we have to do something;
We have to move this along;
This is desperate, John;
Do something;
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, Iet's take a break;
Let's change the tapes;
Come on, man;
Stop tape;
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen;
We have to take a break;
Tape change;
Oh;
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic;
Good;
Good;
Thank you;
Excuse me;
One moment, sir;
NIXON:
Yeah, sure;
Take your time;
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling;
It's all right;
These are just introductory exchanges;
But this session only lasts two hours;
nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff;
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No;
No;
We've got to get something out of that resignation night;
AII right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck;
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff;
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir;
It didn't sound too arrogant or seIf-serving?
Not at all;
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanIike;
Good;
Now continue exactly the same way;
Long answers;
control the space;
Don't let him in;
Okay, got you;
DAVIS:
Set;
And roll;
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and;
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger;
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON:
Good, good;
NIXON;
Yes;
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had;
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different;
I remember the day Eisenhower died;
For God's sake;
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle;
And the day during the impeachment hearings when julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me;
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries;
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know; "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you;
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer;"
This is beautiful;
So Kissinger and I were in the lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in;
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam;
Now, Iet me tell you something that I never told anybody;
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make;
Now, we were in the lincoln Sitting Room at that time;
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying;
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker;
You're a Jew;
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd Iike to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity;
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down;
Now, this was in front of that table where
lincoln signed the Emancipation proclamation;
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says;
Is there;
I'm sorry;
Is there a problem?
That's time;
We're over two hours;
really?
So soon?
well, Mr;
President, I gather our time is up;
Gee, now, that's a pity;
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that;
That was terrific, both of you;
We're getting some great material;
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam;
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I;
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing;
Indeed;
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed;
I Iook forward to it;
Bye-bye;
There's no need to say anything;

Mr;
President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved;
He's gotta be able to shut him up;
Shh;
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think;
Don't worry, Bob;
I'm on it;
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff;
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later;
Look, I'm disappointed, too;
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it;
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater;
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, lloyd, great day;
Bye, David;
I'II see you soon;
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism;
One of our sponsors;
What happened to Xerox?
What about general Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the bIue-chip accounts came through;
We do have AIpo;
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John;
We're already taping;
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David;
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%;
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should;
sold, 30% sold;
Jesus;
I thought we were practically fully financed;
We were;
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this;
well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
credibility of the project;
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern;
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself;
So he's in it for a Iot more than just his reputation;
And we're not?
FROST;
You seemed very confident last time;
I don't understand;
Why this sudden change of heart?
AII right, this is just madness;
It's Richard Nixon;
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum;
Jimmy!
Yes;
Yes, back again, Iike the proverbial bad penny;
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper;
I'm right up against it now;
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes;
And?
honestly?
Far too soft, David;
Go on;
Beat me, John;
Beat me with a stick;
Look;
No, I'm serious;
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him;
You can start by sitting forward;
You've gotta attack more;
If he starts taiIing off, bang, jump in with another question;
Don't trade generalizations;
Be specific;
And above all, don't let him give these seIf-serving, 23-minute homiIies;
Right;
And keep your distance before the tape starts running;
He was toying with you yesterday;
AII that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money;
Those are mind games;
Don't engage;
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator;
Got it;
(NIXON CLEARS THROAT)
Ah;
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant;
(GLASS SMASHING)
It's okay;
We just blew a bulb;
NIXON:
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around;
There's nothing to worry about;
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff;
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP;
(WHISPERING) Focus, sir;
Yeah;
Okay, we are back;
Okay, take it on my count;
Okay, stand by to roll tape;
30 seconds;
DAVIS:
settling;
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you;
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS THROAT) three, two and;
Mr;
President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences;
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
well, Vietnam was not my war;
It was my inheritance;
And it looked to me;
Jump in;
;as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people;
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility;
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through;
Now, look, I couId have bugged out;
I couId have;
I couId have blamed it on my predecessors;
I couId have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain;
But I believed in the cause;
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path;
You might even say that I was the Iast casualty of the Vietnam War;
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics;
Come on, David, Cambodia;
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against;
AII the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it wouId fall;
So why did you do it?
well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars;
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers;
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all;
No, no;
Wait a minute there;
No, I was;
And by sending;
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicaIizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war;
AII right!
;and genocide;
Yes, good, good, good;
There it is;
Okay, run VT;
roll tape;
well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there;
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians;
That's the enemy's way;
well, I'm not suggesting;
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do;
Let me tell you something;
It can just wear you down;
well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who;
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing;
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago;"
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't;
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder;
SAWYER:
Got him;
Safe!
It was horrifying;
It was horrifying;
And he was so confident;
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was;
unquestionably better;
What's next?
Foreign policy;
Great;
Russia, China, the big power stuff;
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements;
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty;
The answer was grow by six inches;
It was agony to watch;
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene;
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else;
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man;
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him;
ZELNICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it;
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember;
Music off, please;
Off;
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response;
well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view;
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement;
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today;
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support;
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David;
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk;
A what?
Go on;
No, say it;
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah;
Yeah, I was;
AII right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points;
frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm;
And this ridiculous seIf-fIageIIation, in my view, is just depressing;
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise;
Look;
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fall, they better leave now, or it'II infect everyone else;
No one?
Right;
Good;
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter;
But before we go, caroline and I would Iike you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick TerraiI's new place;
celebrate?
celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd Iike to celebrate my birthday with a few friends;

No one else could have done that;
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians;

They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities;
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow;
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'II ever see the light of day;
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no;
Shh;
Look, we don't have to go out tonight;
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'II go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back;
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry;
I'II call from the restaurant;
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
I'II have a cheeseburger;
NIXON;
Mmm;
That sounds good;
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr;
Lundgren made me give them up;
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead;
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all;
They taste like Styrofoam;
I hope I'm not disturbing;
No;
It's a Friday night;
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining;
No;
well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night;
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session;
The aII-important final session;
Yes;
Watergate;
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure;
should I be nervous?
well, I'm gonna give it my best shot;
Quite right;
No holds barred;
No holds barred;
You know, it's strange;
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you;
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you;
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight;
There's some interesting stuff in there;
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types;
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge;
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course they did;
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr;
Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us;
I really don't know what you're talking about;
Yes, you do;
Now, come on;
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough;
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times;
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the weII-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved;
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium;
Because we could feel it slipping away;
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up;
Face in the dust;
humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard;
well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us;
We're gonna show those bums;
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are;
Except only one of us can win;
Yes;
And I shall be your fiercest adversary;
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us;
And for the other, it'II be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head;
You can probably tell I've had a drink;
It's not too many;
Just one or two;
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle;
Good night, Mr;
Frost;
Good night,
Mr;
President;
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers;
David?
I've got to work;
NIXON ON TAPE;
well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts;
HALDEMAN;
Yeah, he is;
NIXON;
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those;
But no more sucking around;
From now on, they come to me;
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it;
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los angeles Times;
AII, underlined;
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing;
Is that clear?
MITCHELL;
Yes, sir;
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON;
You open that scab, there's a hell of a Iot of things that we just feel that it wouId be very detrimental to have this thing go any further;
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
hello?
Jim, it's David;
Hey;
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D;
C; for?
Tuesday;
till Tuesday;
Great;
well, you remember you mentioned going to the federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the CoIson stuff?
well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and CoIson?
Uh-huh;
What are you thinking?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hey;
Hey;
Good morning;
And?
(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Excuse me, sir;
It's 8:30;
Bob, have you seen David?
No;
No Frost, no Reston;
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Morning;
Good morning;
Come on, Iet's go;
What's that about?
BIRT:
First time he's late;
REPORTER:
Mr;
President!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Morning;
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT)
Mr;
President;
Mr;
Frost;
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds;
settling;
settle;
well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive;
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room;
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and;
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No;
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice;"
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice;
As it happens, I have;
You have, you say?
well, then, you'II know it doesn't just require an act;
It requires a specific corrupt motive;
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive;
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment;
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution;
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
well, I think the record shows, Mr;
Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it;
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was july 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation;"
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice;
well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to july 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation;
No, no;
Hang on a minute there;
I wasn't;
No, no;
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed;
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fall, that's no defense;
I still tried to rob the bank;
will you just wait one minute there, Mr;
Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was;
well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob HaIdeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased;
That was an unfortunate oversight;
And Bob HaIdeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker;
His notes are there for all to see;
well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with charles CoIson, which I don't think has ever been published;
Okay, here we go;
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records;
well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it;
More than seen it, Mr;
President;
You spoke the actual words;
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23;
Yeah;
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood;
Now, in it you say to CoIson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk;
"That's the problem;"
well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year;
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash;
"I know where it could be gotten;"
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt;"
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks;
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile;"
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem;
"That ought to be handled;" Seven, "The money can be provided;
"EhrIichman could provide the way to deliver it;"
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $1 20,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got;"
And I couId go on;
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, Iet me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts;
You're quoting me out of context, out of order;
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me;
well, it is your life, Mr;
President;
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21 ;
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars;
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None;
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes;
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses;
well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on;
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before;
AII that was HaIdeman and EhrIichman's business;
I knew nothing;
Okay, fine;
Fine!
You made a conclusion there;
I stated my view, now let's move on;
Let's get on to the rest of it;
No, hold on;
No, hold on;
No, I don't want to talk;
If HaIdeman and EhrIichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that;
Maybe I should have;
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men;
"haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can;"
I'm not made that way;
These men, HaIdeman, EhrIichman, I knew their families;
I knew them since they were just kids;
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it;
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal;
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a Iot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the Iaw, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right;
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal;
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe;
Oh, my God;
But I realize no one else shares that view;
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the Iaw?
Oh, my God, we got him;
NIXON;
I;
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, Iet's take a break there;
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it;
Cut it;
Excuse me?
Shut it down;
Shut it down now;
DAVIS:
That's not my call;
You're gonna have to talk to the director;
He's in that truck out there;
BRENNAN:
Get him in here;
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here;
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes;
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it;
FeIIas, this is a critical moment in his life;
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack;
BRENNAN:
Look, we're all in this together;
I'm sure we can find a solution;
ZELNICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN:
Bob, may I remind you;
BIRT:
This is a breach of contract;
We could sue;
(ALL ARGUING)
For heaven's sake, Jim;
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GANNON:
Watch your language, for crying out loud;
(ALL ARGUING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out;
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have;
I know;
But to go on and carry on denying it all;
I appreciate the gesture;
We ought to call it a snafu;
(WHISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
We're on;
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes;
Listen, it's gonna be fine;
Pick up where you left off;
Thirty seconds, everyone;
DAVIS:
Ten seconds;
David?
Four, three, two, and;
Mr;
President, we were talking about the period March 21 to april 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand;
well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)
My goodness;
AII right;
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would Iike to hear you say;
One, that there was probably more than mistakes;
There was wrongdoing;
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too;
secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President;"
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that;" And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it;
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life;
well, it's true;
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy;
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time;
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee;
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it;
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret;
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency;
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel;
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart;
They were not mistakes of the head;
But they were my mistakes;
I don't blame anybody;
I brought myself down;
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish;
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing;
And the American people?
I let them down;
I let down my friends;
I let down the country;
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government;
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest;
Yeah;
(SIGHS)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my Iife;
My political life is over;
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time;
whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot;
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob ZeInick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate;
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the cIose-up;
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get;
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, seIf-Ioathing and defeat;
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist;
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr;
President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm;
Very sweet;
(ENGINE STARTING)
The NixonIFrost interviews were wildly successful;
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television;
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine;
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation;
David, I want to say congratulations;
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them;
I couldn't;
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey;
hello;
I believe David saw the former President just one more time;
Before he left california for London again, he drove down to San clemente to say goodbye;
Hey, Mr;
Frost;
It's nice to see you;
Miss Cushing;
hello;
please excuse my golf outfit;
It's the official uniform of the retired;
Are you on your way home?
Yes;
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
well, Iet's hope so;
Good for you;
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success;
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me;
Yes, I was sorry to see that;
There's no condolences necessary;
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores;
Yeah;
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing;
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but ManoIo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals;
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes;
would you Iike some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me;
No, thank you;
You sure?
Come on;
It'II be no trouble at all;
No, really, we must be;
Okay, fine, fine;
Thanks for coming by;
You were a worthy opponent;
Goodbye, Mr;
President;
Bye-bye;
Goodbye, Mr;
President;
Goodbye;
Oh, God!
I almost forgot;
I;
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired;
I brought you a pair;
well, jeez;
Thank you;
I'm touched;
Safe trip, now;
Oh!
Say, David, you think I couId speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course;
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you;
You know?
Liking people, and being liked;
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm;
I don't have it;
I never did;
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked;
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline;
Maybe we got it wrong;
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer;
Maybe;
David;
Did I really call you that night?
Yes;
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers;
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir;
RESTON;
well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews;
He got back all of his shows;
He even got back his table at Sardi's;
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved;
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate;"
NIXON ON TAPE:
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
NIXON AIDE:
Well, I think, if they...
NIXON: ...

Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
NIXON:
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
MAN:
Yeah.

I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
NEWS REPORTER 1:
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
NEWS REPORTER 2:
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN:
Stand by for camera.
MUDD:
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
DEAN:
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
NEWS REPORTER 3:
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
LAWYER:
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
NEWS REPORTER 4:
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
NEWS REPORTER 5:
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
(CROWD CHEERING)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR:
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
NIXON:
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
(FROST OVER AUSTRALIA THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
- Great show, David.
- Thanks, Noah.
NOAH:
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
NEWS REPORTER:
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
- What, this is live?
- Yeah.
NEWS REPORTER:
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
NEWS REPORTER: ...are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
BRENNAN:
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
- And what?
- Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
CHANCELLOR:
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal."
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
GANNON:
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
- Sir?
- GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
- Nice to meet you.
- Miss Sawyer.
- Pleasure.
- Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
SWIFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
NIXON:
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
- Really?
- Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
(STUTTERING) No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
SWIFTY:
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
- BIRT:
David, how could you have done that?
- What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies
- of the networks.
- They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
- Yes.
- And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
- This would be...
- What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
MAN:
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
- Would you mind?
- Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
(FROST LAUGHS)
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
CAROLINE:
No, thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
- Really?
- Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
- How kind.
- Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
- Do I?
- Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
CAROLINE:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
PILOT:
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST:
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
(INDISTINCT)
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
FROST:
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
MANOLO:
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
NBC EXECUTIVE:
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
- Hey, Bob.
- FROST:
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
FROST:
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
(INTERRUPTING) FROST:
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(SIGHS) You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELNICK:
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
- You're unbelievable.
- I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
- Well, I think he should stay.
- Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
- You think?
- I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
RESTON:
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
BIRT:
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
- BIRT:
Haldeman.
- RESTON:
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON:
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
RESTON:
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
BIRT:
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON:
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
BIRT:
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLINE:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
- Colson, right.
- Colson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHONE RINGING) sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
- Jack.
- Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
(STAMMERS)
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
- Cheerio.
- Bye.
See you in the morning.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
BIRT:
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
- Yeah.
- That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable loneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
(CHEERING)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
KHACHIGIAN:
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
PRICE:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
GANNON:
People love that story.
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACHIGIAN:
Yeah, right, come on.
- REPORTER 1:
David.
- REPORTER 2:
Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 1:
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST:
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
REPORTER 1:
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
REPORTER 1:
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
- NIXON:
Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
GANNON:
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
FROST:
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
(INAUDIBLE)
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
- No.
- Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
- Here we go.

A few questions, please.

Right here, Mr. Frost.

(ALL CLAMORING)
FROST:
Well, hello there.
(SIREN BLARING)
Excuse me, fellas.
MAN:
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
WOMAN:
Liar!
MAN:
Here comes the President!
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 3:
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
RESTON:
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
FROST:
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
(CHUCKLES)
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
(HESITATES)
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
- You trim yours?
- No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
DAVIS:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
DIRECTOR:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN:
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
NIXON:
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote,
- and comfortably.
- John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
- Let's change the tapes.
- Come on, man.
Stop tape.
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
NIXON:
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
DAVIS:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
- RESTON:
Good, good.
- NIXON:
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know."
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER 3:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 4:
Mr. President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
- He's gotta be able to shut him up.
- Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
- Marv, Lloyd, great day.
- Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30%o sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST:
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
- Right.
- And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(NIXON CLEARS THROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASHING)
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
NIXON:
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
- (WHISPERING) Focus, sir.
- Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
DAVIS:
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS THROAT) three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
- And it looked to me...
- Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
- No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
- And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
- All right!
- ...and genocide.
- Yes, good, good, good.
- There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
- SAWYER:
Got him.
- Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELNICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
- That's what I remember.
- Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe
- when he traveled?
- I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
- What are we celebrating?
- It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
- Really?
Well.
- Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(SIGHS) I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(SIGHING) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
I'll have a cheeseburger.
NIXON:
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
- Yes.
- Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
NIXON ON TAPE:
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, he is.
NIXON:
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
- Is that clear?
- MITCHELL:
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON:
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
- Hey.
- Hey.
Good morning.
And?
(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
BIRT:
First time he's late.
REPORTER:
Mr. President!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Morning.
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
- Oh, my God, we got him.
- NIXON:
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
- Excuse me?
- Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
DAVIS:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
- He's in that truck out there.
- BRENNAN:
Get him in here.
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
- Jack, what are you doing?
- A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BRENNAN:
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELNICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN:
Bob, may I remind you...
BIRT:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGUING)
- For heaven's sake, Jim.
- Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GANNON:
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGUING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WHISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
- We're on.
- Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
DAVIS:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(SIGHS)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGINE STARTING)
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
- Miss Cushing.
- Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
- No, thank you.
- You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON:
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
NIXON ON TAPE:
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
NIXON AIDE:
Well, I think, if they...
NIXON: ...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
NIXON:
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
MAN:
Yeah.
NIXON: ...or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
NEWS REPORTER 1:
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
NEWS REPORTER 2:
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN:
Stand by for camera.
MUDD:
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
DEAN:
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
NEWS REPORTER 3:
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
LAWYER:
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
NEWS REPORTER 4:
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
NEWS REPORTER 5:
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
(CROWD CHEERING)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR:
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
NIXON:
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
(FROST OVER AUSTRALIA THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
NOAH:
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
NEWS REPORTER:
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
NEWS REPORTER:
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
NEWS REPORTER: ...are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
BRENNAN:
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
CHANCELLOR:
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal."
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
GANNON:
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
SWIFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
NIXON:
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
(STUTTERING) No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
SWIFTY:
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
BIRT:
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
MAN:
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
(FROST LAUGHS)
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
CAROLINE:
No, thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
CAROLINE:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
PILOT:
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST:
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
(INDISTINCT)
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
FROST:
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
MANOLO:
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
NBC EXECUTIVE:
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
FROST:
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
FROST:
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
(INTERRUPTING) FROST:
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(SIGHS) You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELNICK:
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
RESTON:
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
BIRT:
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
BIRT:
Haldeman.
RESTON:
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON:
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
RESTON:
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
BIRT:
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON:
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
BIRT:
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLINE:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHONE RINGING) sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
(STAMMERS)
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
BIRT:
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable loneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
(CHEERING)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
KHACHIGIAN:
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
PRICE:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
GANNON:
People love that story.
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACHIGIAN:
Yeah, right, come on.
REPORTER 1:
David.
REPORTER 2:
Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 1:
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST:
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
REPORTER 1:
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
REPORTER 1:
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
NIXON:
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
GANNON:
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
FROST:
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
(INAUDIBLE)
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.

Well, hello there.
(SIREN BLARING)
Excuse me, fellas.
MAN:
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
WOMAN:
Liar!
MAN:
Here comes the President!
REPORTER 1 :
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 3:
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
RESTON:
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
FROST:
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
(CHUCKLES)
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
(HESITATES)
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
DAVIS:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
DIRECTOR:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN:
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
NIXON:
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
NIXON:
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
DAVIS:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON:
Good, good.
NIXON:
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know."
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
REPORTER 1 :
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER 3:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 4:
Mr. President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST:
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(NIXON CLEARS THROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASHING)
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
NIXON:
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
(WHISPERING) Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
DAVIS:
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS THROAT) three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
SAWYER:
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELNICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(SIGHS) I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(SIGHING) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
I'll have a cheeseburger.
NIXON:
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
NIXON ON TAPE:
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, he is.
NIXON:
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
MITCHELL:
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON:
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
BIRT:
First time he's late.
REPORTER:
Mr. President!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Morning.
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
NIXON:
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
DAVIS:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
BRENNAN:
Get him in here.
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BRENNAN:
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELNICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN:
Bob, may I remind you...
BIRT:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGUING)
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GANNON:
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGUING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WHISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
DAVIS:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(SIGHS)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGINE STARTING)
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON:
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down. "
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a. m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome. "
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome. "
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives. "
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
- Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
- Come on.
- Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents. "
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
- Haldeman.
- Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people? "
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches. "
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer. "
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer. "
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
- David.
- Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
"A cascade of candor "?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
- Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
Here we go.
OFFICER:
Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David!
David!
David!
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
Liar!
Here comes the President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President.!
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency. "
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
- Yeah, sure.
- Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
- Good, good.
- Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer. "
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer? "
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President, please!
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape. 30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam, "
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
... and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago. "
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
- Got him.
- Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul,
isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President!
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice. "
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation. "
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem. "
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten. "
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt. "
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile. "
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled. " Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it. "
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got. "
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can. "
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
- Oh, my God, we got him.
- I...
Shit!
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
- He's in that truck out there.
- Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President. "
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that. " And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you, but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down, and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The NixonlFrost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate. "
They'd better not push me on him or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking...
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally we're going after the Chandlers every one individually, collectively their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
...or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation...
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries and outlining a range of offenses including wiretapping of newsmen a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will the frightening implications of that for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House in just a few moments now...
President Nixon will be appearing before the people perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time...
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said...
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel...
I just got angrier and angrier because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights a man with no political convictions whatsoever a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia...
Mr. David Frost!
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
...are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon his last moments as President of the United States a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California...
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford who was the new President and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford...
President of the United States have granted, and by these presents do grant a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal...
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight...
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit...
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians...
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that...
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way you know, assuming he's a terrible guy wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host...
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
Haldeman.
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother... 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother...
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say...
"How far do you take executive privilege...
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years...
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post...
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras...
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House...
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators...
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book...
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon...
Sometime before June 23 but I never knew the exact date so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% ...he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% ...where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%...
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
David.
Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
Here we go.
Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David!
David!
David!
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
Liar!
Here comes the President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well...
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question...
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting and partly to ensure there was a record kept of every verbal agreement no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House...
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President...
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety now the tapes have been made public people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end it's the whole political system and by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
Good, good.
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox...
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way...
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where...
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President, please!
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA ...to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend and I know you're already in for more than I asked for but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape. 30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four...
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles... 15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
...a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country wiping out whole civilian areas you end up radicalizing a once moderate people uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts...
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier...
"you might have captured the gun...
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him...
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail they better leave now or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon...
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen...
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves...
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays...
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon...
Go together like Mason and Dixon...
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it...
He wrote a book Now here's the hook...
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David...
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another talking for hours, it seems, days on end and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness with nothing and no one for company but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night...
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President!
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost that far from obstructing justice...
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6...
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6 we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice whether it's for a minute or five minutes and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes a conversation with Charles Colson which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests...
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say...
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white...
I picked out, and these are your words one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt...
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context out of order.
And I might add...
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 ...of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible when you subsequently found out about it why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock...
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly are you really saying that in certain situations the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then to clear the air once and for all that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
I...
Shit!
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30 and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people...
"through two years of needless agony...
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones ones that were not worthy of a president ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times...
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all...
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why...
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment what no investigative journalist no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness, self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The NixonlFrost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps the hard-bitten political press corps called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
...but Manolo here is a lover of dogs and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms as did his friends and investors who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
... admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
Haldeman.
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
David.
Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
REPORTER 1. "A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
Here we go.
Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David!
David!
David!
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
Liar!
Here comes the President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
Good, good.
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President, please!
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape. 30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four, three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
... and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President!
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
I...
Shit!
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness, self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The NixonlFrost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
NIXON ON TAPE.
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
NIXON AIDE.
Well, I think, if they...
NIXON...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
NIXON.
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
MAN.
Yeah.
NIXON... or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
NEWS REPORTER 1.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
NEWS REPORTER 2.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN:
Stand by for camera.
MUDD.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
DEAN.
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
NEWS REPORTER 3.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
LAWYER.
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
NEWS REPORTER 4.
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
NEWS REPORTER 5.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
(CROWD CHEERING)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR:
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
NIXON:
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
(FROST OVER AUSTRALIA THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
ANNOUNCER.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
NOAH:
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
NEWS REPORTER.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
NEWS REPORTER.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
NEWS REPORTER... are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
BRENNAN.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
CHANCELLOR.
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
GANNON:
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
SWIFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
NIXON:
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
(STUTTERING) No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
SWIFTY.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
BIRT:
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
MAN:
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
(FROST LAUGHS)
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
CAROLINE:
No, thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
CAROLINE:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
PILO T. Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
... admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST:
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
(INDISTINCT)
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
FROST:
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
MANOLO:
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
NBC EXECUTIVE.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
FROST:
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
FROST:
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
(INTERRUPTING) FROST:
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(SIGHS) You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELNICK:
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
RESTON.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
BIRT.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
BIRT:
Haldeman.
RESTON:
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON:
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE.
But they've traced the money to him.
RESTON:
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
BIRT:
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON:
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
BIRT:
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLINE:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHONE RINGING) sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
(STAMMERS)
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
BIRT:
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
(CHEERING)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
KHACHIGIAN:
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
PRICE:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
GANNON:
People love that story.
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACHIGIAN:
Yeah, right, come on.
REPORTER 1.
David.
REPORTER 2.
Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 1.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST.
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
REPORTER 1.
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
REPORTER 1.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
NIXON:
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
GANNON:
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
FROST.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
(INAUDIBLE)
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
Here we go.
OFFICER:
Back up behind the curb.
REPORTER 1:
A few questions, please.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Right here, Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 2:
David!

David!
(ALL CLAMORING)
FROST:
Well, hello there.
(SIREN BLARING)
Excuse me, fellas.
MAN:
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
WOMAN:
Liar!
MAN:
Here comes the President!
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 3:
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
RESTON:
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
FROST:
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
(CHUCKLES)
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
(HESITATES)
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
DAVIS:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
DIRECTOR:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN.
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
NIXON:
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
NIXON:
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
DAVIS:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON:
Good, good.
NIXON.
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER 3:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 4:
Mr. President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST.
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(NIXON CLEARS THROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASHING)
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
NIXON:
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
(WHISPERING) Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
DAVIS:
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS THROAT) three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
... and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
SAWYER:
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELNICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(SIGHS) I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(SIGHING) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
I'll have a cheeseburger.
NIXON.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
NIXON ON TAPE.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN.
Yeah, he is.
NIXON.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
MITCHELL.
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
BIRT:
First time he's late.
REPORTER:
Mr. President!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Morning.
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
NIXON.
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
DAVIS:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
BRENNAN:
Get him in here.
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BRENNAN:
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELNICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN:
Bob, may I remind you...
BIRT:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGUING)
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GANNON:
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGUING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WHISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
DAVIS:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(SIGHS)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness, self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGINE STARTING)
The NixonlFrost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON.
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can... really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices... of the Democratic National Committee... in Washington... turns out to be an employee... of President Richard Nixon's re-election... campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised... and arrested yesterday... inside the headquarters of the Democratic
National Committee... in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's... re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse... for the five burglars caught breaking into... the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today... that President Nixon knew about... the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation.
I recall the President telling me... to keep a good list of the press people... giving us trouble... because we will make life difficult for them... after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement... characterizing a president who was easily outraged... over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb... and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy... and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very... essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that... for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation... of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court... has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision... ordering the President of the United States... to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today... that impeachment of the President... by the full House of Representatives... now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency... of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever... resigned from office... in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now.
President Nixon will be appearing... before the people, perhaps for the last time as President... of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office... where so many decisions have been made... that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father... called and he said,
'Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down.'
I was at home with friends, and we were watching... television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else.
I'd been glued to... the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings... night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective... at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction
I imagined I'd feel.
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know... that I would one day be part of the team... that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed... is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led... by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions... whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted... once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage... over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia.
Mr. David Frost.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into... a meat factory in Brisbane... and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men... in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp... really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host... with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that... had won some awards... but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped... by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when... the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds... to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get... the set broken down.
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President... of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history... of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now... from the power of the presidency... to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America... cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when
I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon.
their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait.
that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea... for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims... in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend... and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you... interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political... interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life.
his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone... about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred... confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched... his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California.
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute... attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time... that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda... on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford.
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents... do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon... unto Richard Nixon for all offenses... against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed... the greatest felony... in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates... a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning... of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said,
'Roosevelt had his New Deal,
'Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has... his crooked deal.'
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now... be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes... from the 'stand up and be counted' speech... in 1970?
Sir?
- You know, maybe we're just better off... using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon.
Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet... well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office... as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world... are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit... to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one... you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more... than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get... to put the record straight... and remind people the Nixon years... weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight.
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking... for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were... doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost... would be a whole lot easier than doing it... with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less.
you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table... from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more... and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks.
and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison... into the water... to see if he can miraculously... cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to
Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's... breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them... late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have... the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent
President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No.
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview... and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news.
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night... and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that?
- What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think... he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies... of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia... want you to do another season... of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show... in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success... anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may... never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York... called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen.
You know, I'd be happier... if I heard some kind of vision... that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear... a man doing it... because it would create headlines... or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
'Hello, good evening and welcome.'
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water... on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
'Hello and good evening and welcome.'
You know, I heard an interview with you... recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back... of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person... who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame... without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting... than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are.
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun... our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats... and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa... in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you... first thing in the morning... and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks... to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy... of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host... to interview an American president... with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know.
that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is... very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like... to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs... after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there.
Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit.
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is... you never let a president get behind the wheel... of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything... for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was... a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point... on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours... about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, 'Mr. President, most politicians... 'have tragedy in their early lives.'
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers... to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer... he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets... were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo... at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks... aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies... don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance... this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered... him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian... shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled.
incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making... a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out.
all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program... and syndicate it ourselves, completely... bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own... network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston... and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent... for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol... looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University... of North Carolina... and is writing a book about the criminal... dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear... what you were hoping to achieve... with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours... with the most compelling and controversial politician... of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family... to work on a subject matter... that means more... than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that... without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon... the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking... difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans... and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him... in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him... than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible... to feel anything close to sympathy... for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction.
pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back... and say it was in this interview... that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing... a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown... this entire project is a joke?
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out... on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not... gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man.
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
'British talk show host, 'good with actresses, not so good with... stonewalling presidents.'
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone... is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao... at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president... is the endless round of cocktail parties.
social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you... that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know.
stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and
Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger... and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack.
Reducing the presidency to a series... of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal... doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear.
I didn't want to take any questions... on Watergate, damn it.
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about... is Watergate.
It's as if all my other achievements... have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance... to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping... at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
'Nixon the Man'?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of... biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me.
the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now.
that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms.
rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier... than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where... the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be... any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while... since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting... thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace... of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into
The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into... our research... and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took... the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
Haldeman.
- Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it... into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign... and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really... saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to... legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it... in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him... about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon... was my brother.
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to... foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's... finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
'How far do you take executive privilege... 'before it becomes an undemocratic event?
'
I think you frame the question to him... as a Quaker.
'How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating... an entire people?
'
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic... personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years.
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would... throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration... to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged... abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations... were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close... friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it.
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service.
and they hated me.
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it.
Damn it.
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome... and blue-eyed.
And women all over him.
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same.
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
'When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras... 'for his first interview since he abandoned... the White House, 'he'll be cross-examined as if he were on... the witness stand.
'Frost has hired three crack investigators... 'to help him with the research.
'Clearly the famous TV interviewer... will pull no punches.'
'Crack investigators'?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book.
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a... meeting with Nixon
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the
Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you... for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon... in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel... and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate... be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges... against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach... of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th... and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit... for something in excess of $20 million... in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate... that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75%... he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
'Drone on'?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're... talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did... in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right... at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10%... where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%.
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer... to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations... many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say 'performer'?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said 'performer.'
Not 'journalist' or 'interviewer'?
No.
He said 'performer.'
Out of curiosity, where are you at this... moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness... of the wilderness I am about to... be dispatched to... by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right.
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think... you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
David.
- Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested... that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting... his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of... a cascade of candor.
'A cascade of candor'?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase... that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together... as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
'Why didn't you burn the tapes?
'
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no.
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead... of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set... specific times to deal with certain subjects... if you're just going to ignore it... right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you.
We were sadly unable to do the taping... at Casa Pacifica... because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more... modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican... businessman.
Right here.
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir.
Here we go.
- Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David.
David.
David.
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands.
Liar.
Here comes the President.
Mr. President.
Mr. President.
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture... be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen... him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done... to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for... you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say... how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business... of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well.
I'd just like to say how pleased we are... that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here.
if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made... an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know.
when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history... with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate... with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip... cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio.
well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief... and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field... can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be... covering a lot of subjects... in a great deal of detail over the course... of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely... out of context... by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American... and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch.
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised... by your question... since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement.
I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have... a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize... is that the taping system in the White House... was set up by my predecessor.
President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having... a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was... a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House.
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all.
but the former President.
President Johnson, had repeatedly said... how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels... the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that... all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man... that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through... the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is... almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable... speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our 'ballsy' opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats... that were still against impeachment had... had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, 'Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency.'
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget... he had the most to gain personally... from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that... we were gonna win the impeachment vote,
and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to... stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just... introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting... valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to... get something... out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point.
a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail... him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled.
even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three... in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary... final days, it seems your most emotional moment came... in that heart-to-heart you had... with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment... of your career?
Good, good.
- Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional... a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say... what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter
Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings... when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, 'Daddy, you're the finest man I know.'
'Daddy, you're the finest man I know'?
'And whatever you do, I will support you.
'You just gotta go through the fire.
you know, a little longer.'
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce... about some of the great decisions that... we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that
I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough... decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room... at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
'Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
'Neither of us is particularly orthodox, 'but I'd like to think that each of us... in our own way... 'has a deep religious sensitivity.
'So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment... of silent prayer?
'
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front... of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation
Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again.
and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning... to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up.
you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
Mr. President.
- Mr. President.
Mr. President.
Mr. President, please.
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in... our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner... rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare... the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to... get back to LA... to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone.
Great work.
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless.
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors... or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts... came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically... fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional... on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart... like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising... sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David... over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure... that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying... for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than... just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden... change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s... audience share, minimum.
Jimmy.
Yes.
Yes, back again, like... the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review... yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving.
23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance... before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise... the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there... with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor.
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
Focus, sir.
- Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it... on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four.
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House... than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged... with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there... had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized... how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see... if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won... some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence... suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition.
150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed... right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications... you gave for the incursion... was the supposed existence of... the 'headquarters of the entire Communist military... operation in South Vietnam,' a sort of 'bamboo Pentagon' which proved... not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment... and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge... that would lead to civil war...
All right.
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question... do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war.
yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced... with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts.
I remembered the construction worker... in Philadelphia, because he came up to me... and he said, 'Sir, I got only one criticism... of that Cambodia thing.
'If you'd gone in earlier, 'you might have captured the gun... 'that killed my boy three months ago.'
So you're asking me, do I regret... going into Cambodia?
No.
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
Got him.
- Safe.
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out.
you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me.
begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman... would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust... personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him.
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What 'revolution,' David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim... the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors 'bombing' and 'assaulting' police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting... peacefully and legitimately... against the Vietnam War.
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking... into journalists' homes... was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly.
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members... of the crew say... they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today.
he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential.
for Christ's sake.
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed... to Europe... when he traveled?
I do.
Well, it's irrelevant.
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote... that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say 'talk show host'?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying... to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of... pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No.
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks... we're gonna fail, they better leave now,
or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel... for the next five days, we all go our separate ways... over Easter.
But before we go.
Caroline and I... would like you... to join us for a little celebratory dinner... at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working... at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob.
I'd like to celebrate my birthday... with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most... extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around... for future generations... of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David.
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews... have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped... the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show... will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever... see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me.
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese... and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there... whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing... for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle
Watergate's gonna determine... whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation... for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around... to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff... in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university... full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy.
isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards... or column inches are written about you... or how high the elected office is for me.
it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted.
really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately... just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy... place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt.
A place the snobs always told us... that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried... so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that.
We're not gonna let that happen.
either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards... and power and glory.
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke.
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company... but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused... and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night.
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted... person you have... in the Immigration Service... that they are to look over all the activities... at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send... their teams in to see... whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that... we just feel that it would be very detrimental... to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be... in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember... you mentioned... going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading... this end, and you remember that hunch you had... about the meeting... between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President.
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll.
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call.
it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year... in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice... or were part of a conspiracy to cover up... or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term... 'obstruction of justice.'
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute... with regard to the obstruction... of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it... doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have... a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests... of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences... of your actions would have been... that two of the convicted burglars... would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or... obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows.
Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice.
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me.
this was July 6.
I said, 'Pat, you go right ahead... with your investigation.'
That's hardly what you'd call... obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks... prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately... trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice... is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail.
that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there.
Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence... is because 18 and a half minutes... of the conversation with Bob Haldeman... from this June period... have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate... oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous... and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better... than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers... found it in Washington... where it's available to anyone who consults... the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of... the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier... clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, 'This whole... investigation rests... 'unless one of the seven begins to talk.
'That's the problem.'
Well, what do we mean when we say... 'one of the seven beginning to talk'?
Then moving on to a conversation you had... with John Dean... on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white.
I picked out, and these are your words, one, 'You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
'I know where it could be gotten.'
Two, 'Your major guy to keep under control... is Hunt.'
Three, 'Don't we have to handle... the Hunt situation?
'
Four, 'Get the million bucks.
'It would seem to me that would be worthwhile.'
Five, 'Don't you agree that you'd better get... the Hunt thing going?
'
Six, 'First you've got the Hunt problem.
'That ought to be handled.' Seven, 'The money... can be provided.
'Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it.'
Eight, 'We've no choice with Hunt... 'but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?
'
Nine, 'Christ, turn over any cash... we've got.'
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me... that someone running a cover-up... couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that.
could they?
Look, let me just stop you now... right there, because you're doing something here... which I am not doing, and I will not do... throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add.
I have participated in all these interviews... without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained... that you knew nothing about any of this... until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer... came to Washington... to start the raising of $219,000... of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe... that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for... humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people... with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths... with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees... are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements... to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones... really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police... and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office... and said, 'Hey, there's the two men.
'Haul them down to the dock, 'fingerprint them and then throw them... in the can.'
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman.
I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go.
that became overwhelming.
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher.
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes... that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them... because they're in the greater interests... of the nation.
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best... interests of the nation... and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it.
that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else... shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up... and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
- I...
Shit.
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
- Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment... in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged... the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview.
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you... give him a week off?
Give him a year off.
Give him a fucking massage.
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that... if you were going to make some kind of... emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment... to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you... how crucially important this moment is... and how many potentially devastating consequences... unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty... of time to cook up... some sort of slippery new bullshit.
so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about... the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering... would you go further than 'mistakes'?
The word that seems not enough... for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there... are three things... that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that 'I did abuse the power
I had as President.'
And thirdly, 'I put the American people... 'through two years of needless agony, 'and I apologize for that.' And I know... how difficult it is... for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president,
ones that did not meet the standards... of excellence... that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war... against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility... and I was involved in a cover-up.
as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign... the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No.
Never.
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place.
I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all.
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people... that ought to get into government, but now they think, 'It's all too corrupt,' and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me... for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin... or deception of television... is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric... as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked... and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood... the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day... in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee... or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness.
self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would... not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience... for a news program... in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine... and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition... and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President... just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente... to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises... and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews... as they went out, but they tell me that they were... a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive... about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else... from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said... 'sons of bitches,' but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar... the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God.
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh.
Say, David, you think I could speak to you.
privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people.
and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life... that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician... and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney... welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved... the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy... is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix 'gate.'
NIXON ON TAPE:
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
NIXON AIDE:
Well, I think, if they...
NIXON: ...
InternalRevenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
NIXON:
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
MAN:
Yeah.
NIXON: ...or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
NEWS REPORTER 1:
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
NEWS REPORTER 2:
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN :
Stand by for camera.
MUDD:
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
DEAN:
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
NEWS REPORTER 3:
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
LAWYER:
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
NEWS REPORTER 4:
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H. R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
NEWS REPORTER 5:
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
(CROWD CHEERING)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
WH ITE HOUSE director:
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
N IXON :
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
(FROST OVER australia THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
(CH UCKLES)
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
(AU DlENCE LAUGH ING)
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
NOAH :
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
NEWS REPORTER:
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
NEWS REPORTER:
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a. m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
NEWS REPORTER: ...are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
BRENNAN:
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
CHANCELLOR:
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal."
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
GAN NON :
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
Sir?
GAN NON :
You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
SWlFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
N IXON :
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
director:
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
ln any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
(PHON E RINGING)
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
(STUTTERING) No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
SWlFTY:
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
birt:
David, how could you have done that?
What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen !
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
MAN :
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
(FROST LAUGHS)
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
CAROLIN E:
No, thank you.
flight ATTEN DANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
CAROLIN E:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
ln some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
ln his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
pilot:
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST:
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
(IN DISTINCT)
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
FROST:
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
MANOLO:
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
NBC executive:
lm sorry, David, but its a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
N BC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob.
FROST:
How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
FROST:
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
(INTERRU PTING) FROST:
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million lndo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(sighs) You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELN ICK:
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man !
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with ClA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
RESTON:
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And thats where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
BIRT:
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
birt:
Haldeman.
RESTON :
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON :
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
N IXON ON TAPE:
But theye traced the money to him.
RESTON :
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
birt:
Seventeen?
lncluding his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON :
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
birt:
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed !
And women all over him !
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLIN E:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHON E RINGING) sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
(STAMMERS)
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine. ln which case, the deal is off.
Fine. ln which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
birt:
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable loneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
(CH EERING)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
KHACH lGlAN :
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
PRICE:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
GAN NON :
People love that story.
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACH lGlAN :
Yeah, right, come on.
REPORTER 1:
David.
REPORTER 2:
Mr. Frost.
REPORTER 1:
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST:
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that itll be that of a cascade of candor.
REPORTER 1:
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think thats what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
REPORTER 1:
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
N IXON :
Is that so?
Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
GAN NON :
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
FROST:
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now its about The Slipper and the Rose.
Its a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
(INAU DlBLE)
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you !
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 3:
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
RESTON :
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
FROST:
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
(CHUCKLES)
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
(HESITATES)
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
DAVIS:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
director:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch !
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN:
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
N IXON :
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
director:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
NIXON :
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
DAVIS:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON :
Good, good.
N IXON:
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know."
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I 'msorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
REPORTER 1:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr. President!
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER 3:
Mr. President!
REPORTER 4:
Mr. President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or ibm?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30%% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST:
You seemed very confident last time.
I don understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(N IXON CLEARS TH ROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASH ING)
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
N IXON :
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
(WH ISPERING) Focus, sir.
Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
DAVIS:
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS TH ROAT) three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
... asifthereason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the ClA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
SAWYER:
Got him.
Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELN ICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(piano PLAYING U PBEAT TU N E)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now heres the hook
David !
Patrick.
Hes not a crook He's paid by David
(GU ESTS APPLAU DING)
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(sighs) I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(sigh ING) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHON E RINGING)
I'll have a cheeseburger.
N IXON:
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CH UCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
NIXON ON TAPE:
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, he is.
N IXON:
I mean, he just isn well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the lmmigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
All, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
Is that clear?
MITCHELL:
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON:
You open that scab, theres a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Jim, its David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING) Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTIN U ES)
Hey.

(DOOR OPENS)
(IN DISTINCT)
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll !
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the fbi telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
ln one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming !
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation !
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him.
N IXON:
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
DAVIS:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
He's in that truck out there.
BREN NAN :
Get him in here.
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BREN NAN :
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELN ICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACH lGlAN :
Bob, may I remind you...
birt:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGU ING)
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GAN NON :
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGU ING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WH ISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
DAVIS:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN disbelief)
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(sighs)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixons face, swollen and ravaged by loneliness, self-loathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMORING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGIN E STARTING)
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God !
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh !
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON:
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardis.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
Well, I think, if they...
Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
Or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
Stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
Also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
We stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
Great show, David.
Thanks, Noah.
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
What, this is live?
Yeah.
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
9:00 a.m.
Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
Are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
Fish and chips, please.
And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
You?
Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
So who is it?
Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
And what?
Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
From Richard Nixon?
Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
- Sir?
- You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
Nice to meet you.
Miss Sawyer.
Pleasure.
Mr. Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
No.
Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
Really?
Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
Okay, that is a cut.
Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
What time is it?
Bad time?
No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
For God's sake.
I got $500,000.
Is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
- David, how could you have done that?
- What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks.
They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes.
And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
This would be...
What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
Would you mind?
Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
Not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh.
Well, you'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
What's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really?
Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
How kind.
Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
Do I?
Mmm.
Has anyone told you that before?
No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
To meet Nixon?
Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
Well.
You found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
And you, sir.
May I present Caroline Cushing?
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
Really.
Very romantic.
Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into curbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr. President, most politicians
"have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
Made out in the name of?
Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
What?
Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
No.
Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
- Hey, Bob.
- How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
Second on the subject.
Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
What I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
You're unbelievable.
I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
What the...
He's full of shit, man!
How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
Apparently.
Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
That's the general idea, yeah.
Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
Well, I think he should stay.
Why?
I liked his passion.
He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
What are the other three divided into?
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
You think?
I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
No one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
- Haldeman.
- Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
Opening people's mail.
What about wiretapping?
How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege
"before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators
"to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators"?
Can I be Crack One?
Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
Colson, right.
Colson had a meeting with Nixon
Sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
Jack.
Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
Cheerio.
Bye.
See you in the morning.
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
What's the movie?
It's The Slipper and the Rose.
The Cinderella movie?
Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest caliber.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
Yeah.
That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
Just go right!
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
People love that story.
Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
- David.
- Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
"A cascade of candor"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
- Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
Almost married Diahann Carroll.
Who?
The singer.
Isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
Just don't drink any more.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
No.
Fuck.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
I like it.
It's ballsy.
Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
Over here, sir!
- Here we go.
- Back up behind the curb.
A few questions, please.
Right here, Mr. Frost.
David!
David!
David!
Well, hello there.
Excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
Liar!
Here comes the President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
How are you feeling, Mr. President?
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
They talked to you about that, too?
They're bugging everybody.
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
You gonna shake his hand?
Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
How do you do?
Pleasure, Mr. President.
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
Well...
How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
Is that out of shot?
That's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
You trim yours?
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
No, not that I'm aware.
You were obviously born to be on the tube.
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
They're Italian, aren't they?
My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr. President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was
a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably.
John, we have to do something.
We have to move this along.
This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
Let's change the tapes.
Come on, man.
Stop tape.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Oh.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
It's fantastic.
Good.
Good.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
Listen, was that okay?
Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
Good.
Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
Don't let him in.
Okay, got you.
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
- Good, good.
- Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know. "
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
"Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way
"has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
Is there a problem?
That's time.
We're over two hours.
Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
Indeed.
So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.
- Mr. President!
- Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President, please!
What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
He's gotta be able to shut him up.
Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day.
Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
What the hell is Weed Eater?
It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalizations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
Right.
And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
- Focus, sir.
- Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
30 seconds.
Settling.
You have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
Three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
And it looked to me...
Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
So why did you do it?
Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles,
15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
All right!
...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good.
There it is.
Okay, run VT.
Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
Well, I'm not suggesting...
And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun
"that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
- Got him.
- Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
What's next?
Foreign policy.
Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
That's what I remember.
Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
About what exactly?
About any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled?
I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
What are we celebrating?
It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
And is that Sammy Cahn?
Go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
Soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
Go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really?
Well.
Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
They should have physically stopped me!
No, no, no.
Shh.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
Hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
No.
Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
Yes.
Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
Good night, Mr. Frost.
Good night,
Mr. President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. For?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
Hey.
Hey.
Good morning.
And?
Excuse me, sir.
It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
No.
No Frost, no Reston.
Morning.
Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
First time he's late.
Mr. President!
Morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
What phone call?
The phone call to my hotel room.
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr. President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say
"one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
"It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt
"but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr. President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
No, hold on.
No, hold on.
No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock,
"fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realize no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
- Oh, my God, we got him.
- I...
Shit!
Okay, let's take a break there.
What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
Excuse me?
Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
- He's in that truck out there.
- Get him in here.
Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing?
A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realize we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
Bob, may I remind you...
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
Did you take pity on me?
Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
We're on.
Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people
"through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you,
but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why
Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness, self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
Who came out on top, Mr. President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
The Nixon/Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost.
It's nice to see you.
Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
Are you on your way home?
Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
Well, let's hope so.
Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
No, thank you.
You sure?
Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mr. President.
Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Oh!
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
Do you actually enjoy those?
Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
Maybe.
David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
Cheeseburgers.
Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."

David Frost continues to work as a Tv presenter and news interviewer.
Today his annual summer party is a firm fixture on the British social calendar.
The Nixon interviews remain the most successful program of his career.
Richard Nixon published his I,000 page memoirs in I 978, but never escaped controversy.
He traveled again to China and Russia, though only as a private citizen.
He remained largely absent from official state functions until his death, of a stroke, in I 994.
NIXON ON TAPE:
They'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
NIXON AIDE:
Well, I think, if they...
NIXON:
Internal Revenue people that are kicking Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
He is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
He went on television.
I have not.
I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
Every one of those sons of bitches.
NIXON:
Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
MAN:
Yeah.
NIXON: or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
And we're gonna want to run with it.
NEWS REPORTER 1:
A controversial day in politics.
A man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
He is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
And guess what else he is.
A consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
NEWS REPORTER 2:
The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN:
Stand by for camera.
MUDD:
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
DEAN:
At one point in the conversation, I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
NEWS REPORTER 3:
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offences, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarise the Brookings Institution,
and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
LAWYER:
The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
And consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
NEWS REPORTER 4:
The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.

NEWS REPORTER 5:
Good morning.
The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
It is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
Justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
(CROWD CHEERING)
It's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
A White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
These are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
This is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
You see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
President Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
August 8, 1974
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR:
Fifteen seconds, Mr President.
Okay, that's five, four, three...
Good evening.
This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
James Reston, Jr.
- Author
My father called.
The phone rang, my father called and he said,
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
John Birt
- Director of Programmes London Weekend Television
We stayed up and, like everyone else,
I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
And then finally, it had come to this.
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
But instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
There was no apology.
Little did I know
Bob Zelnick
- Bureau Chief of ABC News that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
And that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
But he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
He understood television.
(FROST OVER AUSTRALIA THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
ANNOUNCER:
And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr David Frost!
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Good evening.
And with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
Now, my first guest tonight...
Well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost,
Jack Brennan
- Former Nixon Chief of Staff other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
He'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
He ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST:
Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
We'll see you then.
God bless.
- Great show, David.
- Thanks, Noah.
NOAH:
Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
NEWS REPORTER:
A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
- What, this is live?
- Yeah.
NEWS REPORTER:
But those were triumphs.
This is not.
What time is it in Washington?
- 9:00 a.m.
- Why didn't he wait?
It's 6:00 in the morning on the West Coast.
Half his audience is still asleep.
All right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
NEWS REPORTER: are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
Richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
Find out the numbers for this, will you?
Worldwide.
BRENNAN:
I remember his face.
Staring out the window.
Down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
They'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
London Weekend Television Studios Two Weeks Later
So what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
- Fish and chips, please.
- And in a moment...
Well, it's too late now.
It's done.
I've called his people...
- You?
- Beans, peas and lamb, please.
And made an offer.
Now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
So it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
- So who is it?
- Richard Nixon.
(LAUGHS) Richard Nixon?
Well, come on, don't look like that.
Well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
Weren't they terrific?
Come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
So, okay, so what kind of interview?
A full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
- And what?
- Come on, David.
Surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
A full, no-holds-barred confession.
Well, we'll get that, too.
- From Richard Nixon?
- Come on, John.
Just think of the numbers it would get.
Do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
Four hundred million.
But in the end, David heard nothing.
And soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford, President of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offences against the United States.
It meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
It was like he slipped out the back door.
A public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
CHANCELLOR:
One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal,
"Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal. "
There was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
The American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
San Clemente, California Three Months Later
GANNON:
So how do we want to address the college protests?
Well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
SAWYER:
Sir?
GANNON:
You know, maybe we're just better off
- using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
- SAWYER:
Just include the whole thing.
Mr President, Swifty Lazar is here.
Okay.
No, no, stick around.
You're gonna get a kick out of this.
This is my literary agent from Hollywood.
Hygiene obsessive.
- Mr President, good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
These are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
- Nice to meet you.
- Miss Sawyer.
- Pleasure.
- Mr Gannon.
Okay, that's it.
I'll see you after lunch.
SWIFTY:
So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you.
Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God.
I despise that game.
Imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
Never retire, Mr Lazar.
To me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
No purpose.
What makes life mean something is purpose.
A goal.
A battle.
A struggle.
Well, even if you don't win it.
When my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
Well, they were wrong.
That was the lowest I got.
Well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
How to spend $2 million, 2.3 to be precise.
It's what I got for your memoirs.
Well, thank you.
Eh...
It might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
That book is important to me.
It's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
You know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
- I'd at least talk to him.
- NIXON:
Who?
David Frost.
English talk show guy.
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?
Well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
- No.
- Well, we didn't get back to him.
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
Well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
We are.
I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
It would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
True, true.
Could probably get more money.
- Really?
- Look.
We'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
But if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
It'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
We tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
Sydney, Australia
We buried him alive, and he walked free.
Today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
Good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
My name is David Frost.
- DIRECTOR:
Okay, that is a cut.
- Thank you.
In any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
Swifty Lazar Beverly Hills, California
To assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
If they take the call, you know they're desperate.
And from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
(PHONE RINGING)
- Hello?
- Mr Frost?
Irving Lazar.
Who?
Swifty Lazar.
I represent President Nixon.
- What time is it?
- Bad time?
(STUTTERING) No!
Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
- Really?
Well, that's terrific news!
- For God's sake.
- SWIFTY:
I got $500,000.
- Is that good?
Mr President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
It's unprecedented.
Yeah?
Well, what's the catch?
With Frost?
None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.
This guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
Well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
- BIRT:
David, how could you have done that?
- What?
$600,000.
That's a fortune.
- 200 on signature?
- Don't worry about the money.
My God.
Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
You're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies
- of the networks.
- They're just jealous.
They're already sounding off about chequebook journalism.
And if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
No syndication, no advance sales.
No advance sales, no commercials.
No commercials, no revenue.
And here's the bigger question, why do it?
You don't need it.
Your career's in great shape.
This will just spread you across three continents, jeopardise the other shows.
Isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
- Yes.
- And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
- This would be...
- What?
You wouldn't understand, John.
You were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
Success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
And the emptiness when it's gone.
And the sickening thought that it may never come back.
You know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
You know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
MAN:
Excuse me, Mr Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
- Would you mind?
- Of course.
But I don't.
I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
And that is what makes me nervous.
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.
"Hello, good evening and welcome."
(FROST LAUGHS)
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr Frost.
- Champagne?
- CAROLINE:
No, thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Another glass, sir?
You don't like champagne?
- Not on aeroplanes.
- Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
The trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
Like the Viennese serve coffee.
Well, I've never been to Vienna.
You'd like it.
It's like Paris without the French.
- What's your name?
- Caroline.
- David.
- Yes, I know.
David Frost.
"Hello and good evening and welcome."
You know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
You were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
- Bentley.
- On the phone.
They said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
- Really?
- Mmm.
You and Vidal Sassoon.
But what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
- How kind.
- Mmm-hmm.
And that you fly around a great deal.
Well, that's true.
- Why?
- I like to keep busy.
- Why?
- I find it more interesting than keeping still.
You know, you have very sad eyes.
- Do I?
- Mmm.
- Has anyone told you that before?
- No.
Are you a sad person?
Let's talk about you a little bit.
Of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
How right you are!
This is your captain speaking.
You may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
If you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly.
Thank you.
CAROLINE:
So how about you?
Where are you going?
To meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
You know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
Where is he now?
In some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
Actually, no.
In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really?
Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
How incongruous.
You can come if you'd like.
- To meet Nixon?
- Why not?
Are you sure?
You know, I would love that.
PILO T:
Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
Well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
He did, too.
Money no object.
Caroline Cushing Los Angeles, California
Everything glittered and was golden.
Well, on the outside.
Of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
Look, we love your work as an entertainer.
That Guinness show?
Love it.
You're a funny guy.
But an interview like this?
You're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
Well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
Thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Okay, thank you so much for your time.
- David, good luck.
- He never let on to anyone at the time, not even me.
You know, that would have meant...
- Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST:
There you are.
See, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
(INDISTINCT)
- You found it okay.
- Yes, thank you.
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr Frost.
- And you, sir.
- May I present Caroline Cushing?
- Miss Cushing.
Hello.
Your house is very beautiful.
- Really.
Very romantic.
- Well, thank you.
And my producer, John Birt.
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?
This is Mr Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
Now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please.
I'd love that.
Thank you.
Come on in.
This is my office.
Now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah.
Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
We talked for nine hours straight.
After the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
Well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
Now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
And the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
He crashed into kerbs.
He went over speed bumps.
He went twice around my whole estate.
Finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
He turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favourite subject, steel mills.
He said, "Mr President, most politicians have tragedy in their early lives."
Well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
And he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
They never know when they're being taped.
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
Until March.
I look forward to it.
Well, thank you, Mr President.
So do I.
You know, it's a funny thing that I've never been challenged to a duel before.
- I guess that's what this is.
- FROST:
Yeah, well, not really.
Of course it is.
And I like that.
No holds barred, eh?
No holds barred.
Mr Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.
Right. $200,000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
Well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
- Made out in the name of?
- Irving Paul Lazar.
Richard M. Nixon.
Here you go.
MANOLO:
Okay, smile.
There.
Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
Well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
- Really?
- Yes.
Goodbye, Mr President.
Hey.
Take my advice.
You should marry that woman.
Yes.
Lovely, isn't she?
More important than that, she comes from Monaco.
They pay no taxes there.
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
- What?
- Come out of his own pocket.
You know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
Without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
So if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really?
So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200,000?
Correct.
Had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
Say, did you notice his shoes?
- No.
- Italian.
No laces.
What do you think?
My people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
You do?
Yeah.
Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
Los Angeles International Airport One Week Later
NBC EXECUTIVE:
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
Try to look at it from our point of view.
Why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show cancelled, incidentally?
I see.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
Obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
Well, that's the networks out, all of them.
Well, that's the end of that, then.
- I'm sorry, David.
- Not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
The idea is we pay for the programme and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
Just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
- Hey, Bob.
- FROST:
How does that grab you?
- Hey, come on in.
David's on the phone.
- FROST:
No, never been done before.
Historic stuff.
Just think about it, okay?
And call me back.
The Plaza Hotel New York City - 1976
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
Delighted to meet you.
Come on in.
Come on in.
Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
Moving to ABC in the new year.
The general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
- Second on the subject.
- Fourth.
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.
Actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
- What I want to achieve?
- Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured twelve taping days.
That's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
Isn't that enough?
Well, not for me.
Look, I'd be giving up a year of my life.
I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
(INTERRUPTING)
FROST:
No, all right.
Well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
Of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
Difficult questions.
The man lost 21,000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
He only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
(SIGHS) You know...
Right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
He devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
The American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
The integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
And if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
Did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
And that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELNICK:
Come on.
Jim, come on.
Thanks for that, Jim.
Could you give us a couple of minutes?
- You're unbelievable.
- I'm sorry, Bob.
You know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
Well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?
- What the...
He's full of shit, man!
- How do you know that?
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
- Apparently.
- Why didn't you tell me?
It isn't relevant.
What's the angle? "British talk show host,
"good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents."
- That's the general idea, yeah.
- Right.
It's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.
What are we gonna do about Reston?
Well, the man's an idiot.
He's overemotional.
Send him home.
- Well, I think he should stay.
- Why?
I liked his
- passion.
- He will drive us all bloody mad.
Well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
He stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs Mao at the banquet table.
Now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
And people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either.
No.
Particularly not in Mandarin.
So Mrs Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
And then across the table, Mrs Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
And then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
Reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
And I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
Soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
It's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
Yeah?
How?
Frost got there.
He got the money.
What?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
But the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really?
Now, that's terrific.
How much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%.
Just one of four 90-minute shows.
- What are the other three divided into?
- Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy,
- and Nixon the Man.
- "Nixon the Man"?
As opposed to what?
Nixon the horse?
Well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now.
The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
Spare me.
Still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr President, it's fantastic.
Frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
You're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
If this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
- You think?
- I'm certain.
It would be so good to go back to where the action is.
You know?
The hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
Well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
It's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
That stuff's been combed over a million times.
- No one has pinned anything on you.
- Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
What his strategy is.
Now, where's he staying?
- I believe The Beverly Hilton.
- The Beverly Hilton, you say.
Well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
Cubans with CIA training.
- Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
- Yes, sir.
RESTON:
A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
And that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
January 27, 1977 55 Days Before The Interviews
BIRT:
And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
Who was the guy that Mike interviewed?
Was that Haldeman?
BIRT:
Haldeman.
RESTON:
Haldeman.
And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
What is Haldeman's official...
Hello, darling.
As for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
And David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON:
All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
February 16, 1977 35 Days Before The Interviews
Essentially, it's an attempt to legalise dirty tricks.
That's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
Wiretapping students.
NIXON ON TAPE:
But they've traced the money to him.
RESTON:
Opening people's mail.
- What about wiretapping?
- How many people has he wiretapped?
This guy wiretapped 17 people.
- BIRT:
Seventeen?
- Including his own brother.
But you know what?
We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother, I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON:
But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
We have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
March 6, 1977 17 Days Before The Interviews
And that's Liddy, right?
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's finest deli selection.
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.
How do we frame a question about Cambodia,
- about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
- I think you should say,
"How far do you take executive privilege before it becomes an undemocratic event?"
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
"How do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?"
FROST:
Come on.
Are they really interested in buying time?
Are they going to give us the money?
How serious are they?
You have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
There's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
Because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
You know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
BIRT:
Okay, the White House taping system.
Ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
March 22, 1977 1 Day Before The Interviews
Lyndon Johnson's White House used them.
So did Kennedy's.
Huston Plan.
Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
Let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
And just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
That man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
And the American people, they loved him for it!
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
Look.
Look.
Now I'm sweating.
Damn it!
Damn it!
And Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
And women all over him!
He screwed anything that moved, and everything.
Had a go at Checkers once.
The poor little bitch was never the same!
Gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLINE:
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,
"When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras
"for his first interview since he abandoned the White House,
"he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
"Frost has hired three crack investigators to help him with the research.
"Clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches."
"Crack investigators?"
- Can I be Crack One?
- Can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
After researching my last book, I was pretty certain Colson...
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?
- Colson, right.
- Colson had a meeting with Nixon
(PHONE RINGING) sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
But if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
A week?
Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
Would there be something I could help you with?
You know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
We're gonna have to take him by surprise.
Don't worry, Jim.
We'll get him anyway.
Hang on a second.
David, Jack Brennan.
He sounds a little emotional.
- I'll take it in here.
- He'll be right with you.
Yeah.
- Jack.
- Watergate.
- Yes, Jack.
- Our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
Well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
You know what I'm talking about.
For the interviews.
We want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
(STAMMERS)
Hold on a minute.
So all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
Correct.
That is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
Okay.
How would you define Watergate?
Well, that it covers just that.
The Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
Fine.
In which case, the deal is off.
Fine.
In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
The terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75% he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"Drone on"?
Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?
You remember who you're talking about here.
You know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
You goddamn media people.
You are so smug.
Well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
Prick.
Look at you.
Gorgeous.
Good night, sweet princes.
- Cheerio.
- Bye.
See you in the morning.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Why the monkey suit?
David has a film premiere he needs to attend.
What?
The night before we start taping?
- What's the movie?
- It's The Slipper and the Rose.
- The Cinderella movie?
- Yeah.
David's the executive producer.
You don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
BIRT:
Don't worry.
David is a performer of the highest calibre.
He's been in these pressure situations many times before.
Come the hour, he'll be fine.
Okay?
What did he say?
Did he say "performer"?
- Yeah.
- That's the word he used?
- Yeah, he said "performer."
- Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
No.
He said "performer."
Out of curiosity, where are you at this moment?
Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
(CHEERING)
So any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao,
- go right to Khrushchev.
- Just go right!
KHACHIGIAN:
You could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
PRICE:
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
Excuse me, sir.
Something I think you should see.
GANNON:
People love that story.
SAWYER:
Why don't we save it for the book?
KHACHIGIAN:
Yeah, right, come on.
REPORTER 1:
David.
REPORTER 2:
Mr Frost.
REPORTER 1:
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
What will you do if he stonewalls you?
FROST:
Well, I shall say so again and again.
But I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candour.
REPORTER 1: "A cascade of candour"?
From Richard Nixon?
You think that's what you'll get?
No, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
REPORTER 1:
So what about the money?
That's a strange fellow.
Started life as a comic, you know.
- NIXON:
Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.
- Almost married Diahann Carroll.
- Who?
GANNON:
The singer.
- Isn't she black?
- Yes, sir.
Right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
Okay.
Let's get back to work.
FROST:
That's fact, this is fiction.
So now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
It's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
Interview Day 1
- March 23,1977
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
- Just don't drink any more.
(INAUDIBLE)
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick.
Wait.
FROST:
For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"
- No.
- Bob.
Please, God, no!
You can't.
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.
It would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
What is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
- 'Cause it's war, isn't it?
Gloves off.
- I like it.
It's ballsy.
- Strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
- It's insanely risky.
He could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
Worse, he could sue you!
We were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.

Here comes the President!
REPORTER 1:
Mr President!
REPORTER 2:
Mr President!
REPORTER 3:
How are you feeling, Mr President?
(REPORTERS CLAMOURING)
The Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
- They talked to you about that, too?
- They're bugging everybody.
RESTON:
You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
The least he could do is look ravaged.
- You gonna shake his hand?
- Am I gonna shake...
Are you kidding me?
After everything that prick's done to this country?
- I'm not gonna shake his hand.
- Gentlemen.
May I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
- How do you do?
- Pleasure, Mr President.
FROST:
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr Reston.
Mr President.
Excuse me, sir?
Got a room for you right here.
Wow.
That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
(CHUCKLES)
I got you guys set up back here.
Now this is your green room.
And the President will be on the large monitor.
Craft services is that way.
Keep it about that temperature, okay?
- Mr President?
- Yeah.
Before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs Nixon's recovery.
Well, thank you.
It's true.
She's much better now.
She's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
And from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
Thank you.
As I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
- Well...
- How much has it cost?
You mind me asking?
Hey, come on.
Come on, it's just between us.
Very well.
Two million.
Two million?
Jeez.
I didn't realise we were making Ben-Hur.
(LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY)
But tell me something.
You raised it all now?
(HESITATES)
Not quite.
But we're getting there.
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
Well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
Excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
- Is that out of shot?
- That's fine, Mr President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
Which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
You're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
If you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
They say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
People who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
But television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
So now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
Sixty seconds, everyone.
- You trim yours?
- No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned.
Yeah.
You got blue eyes.
You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
- No, not that I'm aware.
- You were obviously born to be on the tube.
DAVIS:
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
Settling.
Those shoes.
- They're Italian, aren't they?
- My shoes?
I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
(SNIFFLES)
You don't find them too effeminate?
No.
Well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
DIRECTOR:
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two.
Cue David.
And...
Mr President.
Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question,
more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
Why didn't you burn the tapes?
Son of a bitch!
Well, Mr Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
But if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
What probably very few people realise is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was a record kept of every verbal agreement,
no matter how off the cuff or casual.
Now, initially, on coming into the White House, I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
President Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
BRENNAN:
Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
It's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
It's kind of a sickening moment, when he realises that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
You could see it in Frost's face.
If he didn't know the calibre of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
They're less likely to offer that advice.
So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
So much for our "ballsy" opening.
So when did you actually decide...
At what moment did you know you were going to resign?
That's good.
That's good.
I remember exactly.
It was July 23.
After it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
That night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it.
There goes the presidency."
And, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
And Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote,
- and comfortably.
- John, we have to do something.
- We have to move this along.
- This is desperate, John.
Do something.
Twenty-three minutes on one question?
Okay, let's take a break.
- Let's change the tapes.
- Come on, man.
Stop tape.
DIRECTOR:
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
We have to take a break.
Tape change.
Okay, how's that?
You getting what you need?
- It's fantastic.
- Good.
Good.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
One moment, sir.
- NIXON:
Yeah, sure.
Take your time.
What are you doing, David?
You've got to stop him rambling.
It's all right.
These are just introductory exchanges.
But this session only lasts two hours.
Nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
The moment that he made the decision to resign,
- we should be scoring points with that stuff.
- Want me to switch to Vietnam?
No.
No.
We've got to get something out of that resignation night.
All right?
That was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck.
On his knees?
Praying with Kissinger?
Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
- Listen, was that okay?
- Perfect, sir.
It didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
Not at all.
You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
- Good.
- Now continue exactly the same way.
Long answers.
Control the space.
- Don't let him in.
- Okay, got you.
DAVIS:
Set.
And roll.
We're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
Reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
Was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
- RESTON:
Good, good.
- NIXON:
Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
Except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
For God's sake.
And the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
And the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me.
She cried, you know?
And she so seldom cries.
She said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know."
"Daddy, you're the finest man I know?"
"And whatever you do, I will support you.
"You just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer."
This is beautiful.
So Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
There was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
Now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
Whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
Now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
"Now, Henry, I'm a Quaker.
You're a Jew.
Neither of us is particularly orthodox,
"but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way has a deep religious sensitivity.
"So if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?"
So we knelt down.
Now, this was in front of that table where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
And then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
Is there...
I'm sorry.
- FROST:
Is there a problem?
- That's time.
- We're over two hours.
- Really?
So soon?
Well, Mr President, I gather our time is up.
Gee, now, that's a pity.
You know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
That was terrific, both of you.
We're getting some great material.
You know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
- And we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
- Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
- Indeed.
- So, day after tomorrow, 10:00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.
There's no need to say anything.

REPORTER 4:
Mr President, please!
(WHISPERING) What are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
- He's gotta be able to shut him up.
- Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
Don't worry, Bob.
I'm on it.
We can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Look, I'm disappointed, too.
But I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimise it.
It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone!
Great work!
- Marv, Lloyd, great day.
- Bye, David.
I'll see you soon.
God bless!
- What the hell is Weed Eater?
- It's a horticultural mechanism.
One of our sponsors.
What happened to Xerox?
What about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
We do have Alpo.
Dog food?
(STUTTERING) Wait, John.
We're already taping.
So we're close, right?
We're very close?
That's probably a question you should ask David.
Are we close, John?
- I believe we're at 30%.
- To go?
Or 30% sold?
Again, that's probably a question you should...
Sold, 30% sold.
- Jesus...
- I thought we were practically fully financed.
We were.
But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
Well, why have they fallen apart?
Based on what?
Credibility of the project.
What else are advertising sales based on?
Listen, I understand your concern.
But could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
'Cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
So he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
And we're not?
FROST:
You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand.
Why this sudden change of heart?
All right, this is just madness.
It's Richard Nixon.
These interviews will do mid-30's audience share, minimum.
Jimmy!
Yes.
Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
Look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
Interview Day 2
- March 25, 1977
So, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
- And?
- Honestly?
Far too soft, David.
- Go on.
Beat me, John.
Beat me with a stick.
- Look.
No, I'm serious.
You have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
You can start by sitting forward.
You've gotta attack more.
If he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
Don't trade generalisations.
Be specific.
And above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
- Right.
- And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
He was toying with you yesterday.
All that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
Those are mind games.
Don't engage.
Never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
Got it.
(NIXON CLEARS THROAT)
Ah.
The Grand Inquisitor!
No, just your friendly neighbourhood confidant.
(GLASS SMASHING)
It's okay.
We just blew a bulb.
NIXON:
This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
There's nothing to worry about.
As a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
DAVIS:
Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
- (WHISPERING) Focus, sir.
- Yeah.
Okay, we are back.
Okay, take it on my count.
Okay, stand by to roll tape.
Thirty seconds.
DAVIS:
Settling.
- You have a pleasant evening last night?
- Yes, thank you.
Did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
(CLEARS THROAT) three, two and...
Mr President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
Did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
Well, Vietnam was not my war.
It was my inheritance.
- And it looked to me...
- Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
It seemed to me they hadn't realised how important a test this was of American credibility.
The whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
Now, look, I could have bugged out.
I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
But I believed in the cause.
And sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
You might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
Come on, David, Cambodia.
And Cambodia?
An invasion which everybody advised you against.
All the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
- So why did you do it?
- Well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22,000 rifles, 15 million rounds of ammunition, 150,000 rockets, mortars.
That's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
But one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
No, no.
Wait a minute there.
No, I was...
And by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
- RESTON:
All right!
...and genocide.
- Yes, good, good, good.
- There it is.
- Okay, run VT.
- Roll tape.
Well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
Look, it was never US policy to kill civilians.
That's the enemy's way.
- Well, I'm not suggesting...
- And if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
Let me tell you something.
It can just wear you down.
Well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
But whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing.
"If you'd gone in earlier,
"you might have captured the gun that killed my boy three months ago."
So you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No!
I don't.
You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
- SAWYER:
Got him.
- Safe!
It was horrifying.
It was horrifying.
And he was so confident.
(REPORTERS CLAMOURING)
REPORTER:
What are you gonna say about Watergate?
Sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
Better?
It was.
Unquestionably better.
- What's next?
- Foreign policy.
- Great.
Russia, China, the big power stuff.
- Yeah, so?
So if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
(RESTON LAUGHS)
It ain't gonna be pretty.
The answer was grow by six inches.
It was agony to watch.
Now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
You see, he and Mao didn't get along,
Interview Day 3
- March 28, 1977 and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
You see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
When David tried to lay a finger on him, Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELNICK:
What "revolution," David?
You just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
What, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
That's not how I remember it.
What I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
- That's what I remember.
- Music off, please.
Off.
By the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
Well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
- About what exactly?
- About any of it, frankly!
- I thought today was a huge improvement.
- Are you nuts?
Let me tell you how bad things were today.
After the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
You're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
And forget about the trivia, David.
Who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe
- when he travelled?
- I do!
Well, it's irrelevant!
And it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
A what?
Go on.
No, say it.
What, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was.
All right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
Frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
And this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
And threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
Look.
If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
No one?
Right.
Good.
Now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
But before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
Celebrate?
Celebrate what, David?
The fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
- What are we celebrating?
- It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
(PIANO PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE)
Look, is that Neil Diamond?
(SINGING) Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon...
And is that Sammy Cahn?
... Go together like Prancer and Vixen...
David, did you hear that?
... Soaring through the airwaves...
- Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
- Oh, my God.
Hoping for several hefty paydays
- Yeah, I think it is.
With Michael York.
- That's gotta be Bunnies.
Those are Bunnies?
Those are real Bunnies?
Frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon,
Go together like Mason and Dixon...
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
... Frost lines up with Dicky...
No one else could have done that.
And these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
That bad?
He saved it
He wrote a book Now here's the hook
- David!
- Patrick.
He's not a crook He's paid by David
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)
My, what a festive atmosphere.
Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
Better than that, ma'am.
It's a shutout.
The President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
- Really?
Well.
- Yeah.
Well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
(SIGHS) I see.
Is there nothing we can do?
Really?
(SIGHING) Right.
Well, thanks for letting me know.
It's true.
They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
They felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
Now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
What have I done?
What was I thinking?
Why didn't anyone stop me?
- They should have physically stopped me!
- No, no, no.
Look, we don't have to go out tonight.
Why don't we stay in?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
Steak or fish?
David?
Don't worry.
I'll call from the restaurant.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
I'll have a cheeseburger.
NIXON:
Mmm.
That sounds good.
I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
He switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
He calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
They taste like Styrofoam.
- I hope I'm not disturbing.
- No.
It's a Friday night.
You've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
- No.
- Well, then what are you doing?
A handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
If you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
The all-important final session.
- Yes.
- Watergate.
'Cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
Should I be nervous?
Well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
Quite right.
No holds barred.
No holds barred.
You know, it's strange.
Now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
One of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
And I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
There's some interesting stuff in there.
Your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
What was it?
Oxford?
Cambridge.
Did the snobs there look down on you, too?
(CHUCKLES)
Of course they did.
That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr Frost?
No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Now, come on.
No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
We still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
The smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
And isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
If we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now?
The two of us?
Looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
Because we could feel it slipping away.
We were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
A place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
Face in the dust.
Humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
Well, to hell with that!
We're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
We're gonna show those bums.
We're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
We are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
Am I right?
You are.
Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
And I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
And for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company
but those voices ringing in our head.
You can probably tell I've had a drink.
It's not too many.
Just one or two.
But you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
- Good night, Mr Frost.
- Good night,
Mr President.
So with or without cheese?
I brought burgers.
- David?
- I've got to work.
NIXON ON TAPE:
Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
He must be a little nuts.
HALDEMAN:
Yeah, he is.
NIXON:
I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
Isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
But no more sucking around.
From now on, they come to me.
There is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
AII, underlined.
And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
- Is that clear?
- MITCHELL:
Yes, sir.
(TAPE REWINDING)
NIXON:
You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
- Hello?
- Jim, it's David.
Hey.
What time is it?
How much longer are you gonna be in D.C. for?
Tuesday.
Till Tuesday.
Great.
Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
(BABY CRYING)
Honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
Well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh.
What are you thinking?
3 Days Later
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Good morning.
- And?
(TRIUMPHANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
Excuse me, sir.
- It's 8:30.
Bob, have you seen David?
- No.
No Frost, no Reston.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- Morning.
- Good morning.
Come on, let's go.
What's that about?
BIRT:
First time he's late.
REPORTER:
Mr President!
(CROWD CLAMOURING)
Morning.
(DOOR OPENS)
(INDISTINCT)
- Mr President.
- Mr Frost.
DAVIS:
Thirty seconds to tape roll!
Thirty seconds.
Settling.
Settle.
Well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
- What phone call?
- The phone call to my hotel room.
DAVIS:
David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
Now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice
Final Interview
- April 22, 1977 or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
No.
And I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
Now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
As it happens, I have.
You have, you say?
Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
It requires a specific corrupt motive.
And in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
What I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
Be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
Now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
Well, I think the record shows, Mr Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
When Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
That's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
Well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
No, no.
Hang on a minute there.
I wasn't...
No, no.
Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defence to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defence.
I still tried to rob the bank.
Will you just wait one minute there, Mr Frost?
There is no evidence of any kind that I was...
Well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
That was an unfortunate oversight.
And Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
His notes are there for all to see.
Well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
Okay, here we go.
It hasn't been published, you say?
No, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
Well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
More than seen it, Mr President.
You spoke the actual words.
Now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
But this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
Now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests
"unless one of the seven begins to talk.
"That's the problem."
Well, what do we mean when we say "one of the seven beginning to talk"?
Then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
In one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, "You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
"I know where it could be gotten."
Two, "Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt."
Three, "Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?"
Four, "Get the million bucks.
It would seem to me that would be worthwhile."
Five, "Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?"
Six, "First you've got the Hunt problem.
"That ought to be handled." Seven, "The money can be provided.
"Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it."
Eight, "We've no choice with Hunt but the $120,000 or whatever it is, right?"
Nine, "Christ, turn over any cash we've got."
And I could go on.
Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
Look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
You're quoting me out of context, out of order.
And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
Well, it is your life, Mr President.
Now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
But in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219,000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
Now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
None.
I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
To help disadvantaged people with their defences.
Well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
That's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
Look, I have made statements to this effect before.
All that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing.
Okay, fine.
Fine!
You made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
Let's get on to the rest of it.
- No, hold on.
No, hold on.
- No, I don't want to talk...
If Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
Isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.
Maybe I should have.
Just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men.
"Haul them down to the dock, fingerprint them and then throw them in the can."
I'm not made that way.
These men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
So I did it.
I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
And I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
Look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
Right.
Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
That's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
But I realise no one else shares that view.
So, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
- Oh, my God, we got him.
- NIXON:
I...
Shit!
(DOOR OPENS)
- Okay, let's take a break there.
- What the fuck is going on?
Cut it.
Cut it.
- Excuse me?
- Shut it down.
Shut it down now.
DAVIS:
That's not my call.
You're gonna have to talk to the director.
- He's in that truck out there.
- BRENNAN:
Get him in here.
DAVIS:
Listen, we have an issue in here.
- Jack, what are you doing?
- A break?
Change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
What the hell is going on, Jack?
He was about to blow and you know it.
Fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
You realise we could sue you for this?
You have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
BRENNAN:
Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELNICK:
A solution?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN:
Bob, may I remind you...
BIRT:
This is a breach of contract.
We could sue.
(ALL ARGUING)
For heaven's sake, Jim.
Why don't you give him a week off?
Give him a year off!
Give him a fucking massage!
GANNON:
Watch your language, for crying out loud.
(ALL ARGUING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
What'd you do?
Throw in the towel, Jack?
- Did you take pity on me?
- Sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
But to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
We ought to call it a snafu.
(WHISPERING)
Jack, are we on?
- We're on.
- Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
Listen, it's gonna be fine.
Pick up where you left off.
Thirty seconds, everyone.
DAVIS:
Ten seconds.
David?
Four, three, two, and...
Mr President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering
would you go further than "mistakes"?
The word that seems not enough for people to understand.
Well, what word would you express?
(EXCLAIMS IN DISBELIEF)
My goodness.
All right.
Since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
One, that there was probably more than mistakes.
There was wrongdoing.
And, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
Secondly, that "I did abuse the power I had as President."
And thirdly, "I put the American people through two years of needless agony,
"and I apologise for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you, but I think the people need to hear it.
And I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
Well, it's true.
I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
But, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
But, yes, I will admit there were times I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
And for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
No one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
Now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No!
Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
They were not mistakes of the head.
But they were my mistakes.
I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
And I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
And the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
And worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
And the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
(SIGHS)
I let the American people down,
and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
My political life is over.
You know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
Whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
At first, I couldn't understand why Bob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews,
or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
But that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
Because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
Richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness, self-Ioathing and defeat.
The rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
(REPORTERS CLAMOURING)
REPORTER:
Who came out on top, Mr President?
Is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
Very sweet.
(ENGINE STARTING)
The NixonlFrost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news programme in the history of American television.
David was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
And even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
The interviews?
No, I didn't watch them.
I couldn't.
(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey.
Hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
Before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr Frost.
It's nice to see you.
- Miss Cushing.
- Hello.
Please excuse my golf outfit.
It's the official uniform of the retired.
- Are you on your way home?
- Yes.
Into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
- Well, let's hope so.
- Good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
There's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
Jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
You know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
Can I get something for somebody?
Yes.
Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
- No, thank you.
- You sure?
- Come on.
It'll be no trouble at all.
- No, really, we must be...
Okay, fine, fine.
Thanks for coming by.
You were a worthy opponent.
- Goodbye, Mr President.
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, Mr President.
- Goodbye.
Oh, God!
I almost forgot.
I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
Well, jeez.
Thank you.
I'm touched.
Safe trip, now.
Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
Do you know those parties of yours?
The ones that I read about in all the papers?
- Do you actually enjoy those?
- Of course.
You got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
You know?
Liking people, and being liked.
Having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it.
I never did.
It kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
Maybe we got it wrong.
Maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
- Maybe.
- David.
Did I really call you that night?
Yes.
Did we discuss anything important?
- Cheeseburgers.
- Cheeseburgers?
Goodbye, sir.
RESTON:
Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
He got back all of his shows.
He even got back his table at Sardi's.
As for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
His most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate."
David Frost continues to work as a TV presenter and news interviewer.
Today his annual summer party is a firm fixture on the British social calendar.
The Nixon interviews remain the most successful programme of his career.
Richard Nixon published his 1,000 page memoirs in 1978, but never escaped controversy.
He travelled again to China and Russia, though only as a private citizen.
He remained largely absent from official state functions until his death, of a stroke, in 1994.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a... "
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself. "
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
... dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats... "
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
- Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "i" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
- No, no, no.
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
- Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!
What do you mean?
- I was dead.
For seven minutes.
- Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maÏïtre d'?
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.
- All right.
- Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings. " I knew what you meant with that.
- Lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
- Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
- Lf you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
- Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.
- What?
- Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
- My head.
It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
- What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a. m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
- What?
What do you get?
- You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90%% % of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
- Really?
- Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- She might like that.
- Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here...
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
- Good God, no.
- No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Twice a week.
Free weights.
- Okay.
All right.
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
- Yes.
I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great. "
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi. "
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
- Hey, will you come?
- What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.
- No.
That's...
- You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.
- No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
- No, like...
- Down there.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
- Why'd you move?
- London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
- Wife?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.
There's a 38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
- What the...
- Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care. " You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
- Sorry.
What is that?
- My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...
- Come on!
... are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
- What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
- What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
... and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
- Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving... "
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious. "
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert. "
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
- You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I...
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.
- Yeah.
- And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
- How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this. "
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.
- You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- I quit.
- You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
- You are through.
- What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
- Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- It's personal.
- I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.
- I'm a good listener.
Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?
- I'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
- No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
- What?
- She dumped him last night.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
- Is that a lot?
- No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No.
Definitely not.
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- I can't.
- Me, neither.
- Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
- Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
- You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- I love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range. "
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- I don't.
- You do.
- Common expression?
- No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
- Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
- How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk. "
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work. "
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- I love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
- What?
- It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
- Hello.
- What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
- Hail.
- What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?
- Yeah.
- We're friends.
- Well...
- Associates.
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
- Yeah.
- We're close.
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.
- No.
- Sit down.
- Why?
- Just sit down.
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
- It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at your wives...
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
- What?
- Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
- Well...
- In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
- What?
What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
- Wait a minute.
- Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk. "
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
- Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
- Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a..."
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself."
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
...dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats..."
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
- Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "i" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
- No, no, no.
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
- Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!
What do you mean?
- I was dead.
For seven minutes.
- Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maÏïtre d'?
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.
- All right.
- Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings." I knew what you meant with that.
- Lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
- Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
- Lf you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
- Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.
- What?
- Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
- My head.
It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
- What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a.m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
- What?
What do you get?
- You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90%% % of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
- Really?
- Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- She might like that.
- Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here...
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
- Good God, no.
- No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Twice a week.
Free weights.
- Okay.
All right.
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
- Yes.
I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great."
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi."
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
- Hey, will you come?
- What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.
- No.
That's...
- You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.
- No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
- No, like...
- Down there.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
- Why'd you move?
- London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
- Wife?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.
There's a .38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
- What the...
- Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care." You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
- Sorry.
What is that?
- My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...
- Come on!
...are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
- What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
- What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
...and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
- Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving..."
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious."
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert."
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
- You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I...
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.
- Yeah.
- And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
- How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this."
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.
- You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- I quit.
- You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
- You are through.
- What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
- Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- It's personal.
- I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.
- I'm a good listener.
Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?
- I'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
- No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
- What?
- She dumped him last night.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
- Is that a lot?
- No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No.
Definitely not.
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- I can't.
- Me, neither.
- Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
- Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
- You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- I love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range."
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- I don't.
- You do.
- Common expression?
- No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
- Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
- How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk."
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work."
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- I love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
- What?
- It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
- Hello.
- What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
- Hail.
- What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?
- Yeah.
- We're friends.
- Well...
- Associates.
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
- Yeah.
- We're close.
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.
- No.
- Sit down.
- Why?
- Just sit down.
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
- It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at your wives...
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
- What?
- Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
- Well...
- In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
- What?
What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
- Wait a minute.
- Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk."
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
- Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
- Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a..."
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself."
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
...dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats..."
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
- Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "i" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
- No, no, no.
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
- Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!
What do you mean?
- I was dead.
For seven minutes.
- Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maÏïtre d'?
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.
- All right.
- Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings." I knew what you meant with that.
- Lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
- Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
- Lf you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
- Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.
- What?
- Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
- My head.
It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
- What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a.m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
- What?
What do you get?
- You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90%% % of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
- Really?
- Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- She might like that.
- Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here...
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
- Good God, no.
- No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Twice a week.
Free weights.
- Okay.
All right.
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
- Yes.
I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great."
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi."
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
- Hey, will you come?
- What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.
- No.
That's...
- You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.
- No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
- No, like...
- Down there.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
- Why'd you move?
- London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
- Wife?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.
There's a .38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
- What the...
- Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care." You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
- Sorry.
What is that?
- My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...
- Come on!
...are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
- What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
- What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
...and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
- Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving..."
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious."
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert."
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
- You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I...
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.
- Yeah.
- And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
- How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this."
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.
- You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- I quit.
- You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
- You are through.
- What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
- Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- It's personal.
- I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.
- I'm a good listener.
Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?
- I'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
- No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
- What?
- She dumped him last night.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
- Is that a lot?
- No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No.
Definitely not.
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- I can't.
- Me, neither.
- Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
- Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
- You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- I love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range."
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- I don't.
- You do.
- Common expression?
- No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
- Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
- How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk."
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work."
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- I love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
- What?
- It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
- Hello.
- What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
- Hail.
- What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?
- Yeah.
- We're friends.
- Well...
- Associates.
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
- Yeah.
- We're close.
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.
- No.
- Sit down.
- Why?
- Just sit down.
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
- It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at your wives...
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
- What?
- Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
- Well...
- In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
- What?
What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
- Wait a minute.
- Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk."
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
- Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
- Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.

Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a..."
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
Careful with my table!
Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
There, good.
See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself."
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
...dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
Did you see that?
Someone call 911!
Oh, my God, is he dead?
He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
Yeah, she really is.
How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
That seems like a really long time.
No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
See, that's, like, too long.
It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
Why do you need to know that?
Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
Food allergies?
I'm not gonna be eating here.
Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
Do you wear dentures?
Madame, listen.
When was the last time you ate?
A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Why do you look that tan?
Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
I don't know if...
No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
You gonna go darker?
I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
Makes people say crazy things.
I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats..."
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
Why do you just keep talking while...
I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
Did anything unusual happen...
You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe, but after that, you responded...
The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
No, I don't remember that.
Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
Nothing, I'm afraid.
He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
Is this your signature at the bottom?
When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "I" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
Thank you!
Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
- No, no, no.
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
Where do you want to go, pal?
Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
Campari and soda.
Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
Just get a real drink.
Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
- Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
I died today!
What do you mean?
- I was dead.
For seven minutes.
- Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maître d'?
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
Drink your drink.
I'm gonna drink my drink.
- All right.
- Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
What kind of anesthetic did they use?
They didn't want to use any.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings."
I knew what you meant with that.
If we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
She won't speak to her sister...
Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
If you would come through for me...
I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
- Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
It's all right, I can take a hint.
It's not a hint.
Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
Just go to hell.

- What?
- Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
My head.
It's throbbing.
I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
- What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
You don't want to at least help Gwen?
She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a.m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
What?
What do you get?
You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance to connect with another human being...
Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90% of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
I've never seen her before.
One of those things?
You stole her cab, remember?
I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
- Really?
- Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
Give her another option.
I don't get it.
Present her with an alternative.
Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
Don't need a male model or a fireman.
Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- She might like that.
- Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.
1.4's burial site.
Here...
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
Good God, no.
No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
So you use hookers.
No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Twice a week.
Free weights.
Okay.
All right.
You got a nice, thick head of hair.
Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
- Yes.
I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
I enjoyed your lecture very much.
Thank you.
Don't take the walk-outs personally.
I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
Atrocious dental hygiene.
I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
What the hell is your problem?
I don't have a problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
Yeah, they suck.
Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great."
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi."
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
For the love of God!
4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
- Hey, will you come?
- What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.
- No.
That's...
- You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.
- No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
- No, like...
- Down there.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
Have you lived in the building long?
Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
Why'd you move?
London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
- Wife?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
But that's not funny.
Funnier than the truth.
Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
Should I make an appointment?
No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
Can you tell what it is?
It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.
There's a.38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
- What the...
- Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
Yeah, it's just the...
'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
I hope it was edible.
Best curry I've ever tasted.
Stop complimenting him!
You're too kind.
Where did you learn to cook?
Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care." You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
Sorry.
What is that?
My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
I need you to punch him.
But what we really need...
- Come on!
...are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel..
..outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
- What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
- What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
...and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
No, not at all.
Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
- Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband,..
..and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving..."
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
Someone I really hate.
Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious."
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert."
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
- You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
I'll bet he was.
But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I...
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs..
..in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.
- Yeah.
- And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
- How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too,..
..and she says, "No, no, let me get this."
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.
- You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
She loves him.
She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- I quit.
- You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.

There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
- You are through.
- What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
- Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
No, forget about it.
No, I can't forget about it.
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.
Can we just get this...
Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- It's personal.
- I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
Why don't we just...
"Finish what you started" is my motto.
I'm a good listener.
Please.
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?
- I'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
- No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
They used live ammo.
Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
- What?
- She dumped him last night.
How do you know?
He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
Is that a lot?
No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
I mean, young couples at this stage...
No.
Definitely not.
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- I can't.
- Me, neither.
- Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
I bought her over the years?
I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
- You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- I love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range."
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- I don't.
- You do.
- Common expression?
- No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
- How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk."
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work."
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- I love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
- What?
- It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
- Hello.
- What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
- Hail.
- What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?
- Yeah.
- We're friends.
- Well...
- Associates.
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
- Yeah.
- We're close.
No, I wouldn't say that.
Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.
- No.
- Sit down.
- Why?
- Just sit down.
Oh, look, never mind.
This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
Yes, they can let him go.
You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at your wives...
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
- What?
- Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
- Well...
- In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
Is that what you want me to believe?
What do you want to tell him?
What do you want to say?
I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
What?
What'd he say?
He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
I can't check with him.
Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
Wait a minute.
You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
Wait a minute.
Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!

Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk."
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
You went darker.
I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.

Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a... "
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself. "
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
... dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats... "
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
- Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "i" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
- No, no, no.
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
- Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!
What do you mean?
- I was dead.
For seven minutes.
- Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maÏïtre d'?
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.
- All right.
- Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings. " I knew what you meant with that.
- Lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
- Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
- Lf you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
- Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.
- What?
- Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
- My head.
It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
- What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a. m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
- What?
What do you get?
- You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90%% % of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
- Really?
- Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- She might like that.
- Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here...
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
- Good God, no.
- No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Twice a week.
Free weights.
- Okay.
All right.
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
- Yes.
I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great. "
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi. "
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
- Hey, will you come?
- What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.
- No.
That's...
- You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.
- No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
- No, like...
- Down there.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
- Why'd you move?
- London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
- Wife?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.
There's a.38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
- What the...
- Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care. " You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
- Sorry.
What is that?
- My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...
- Come on!
... are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
- What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
- What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
... and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
- Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving... "
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious. "
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert. "
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
- You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I...
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.
- Yeah.
- And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
- How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this. "
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.
- You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- I quit.
- You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
- You are through.
- What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
- Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- It's personal.
- I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.
- I'm a good listener.
Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?
- I'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
- No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
- What?
- She dumped him last night.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
- Is that a lot?
- No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No.
Definitely not.
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- I can't.
- Me, neither.
- Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
- Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
- You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- I love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range. "
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- I don't.
- You do.
- Common expression?
- No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
- Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
- How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk. "
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work. "
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- I love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
- What?
- It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
- Hello.
- What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
- Hail.
- What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?
- Yeah.
- We're friends.
- Well...
- Associates.
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
- Yeah.
- We're close.
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.
- No.
- Sit down.
- Why?
- Just sit down.
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
- It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at your wives...
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
- What?
- Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
- Well...
- In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
- What?
What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
- Wait a minute.
- Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk. "
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
- Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
- Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a..."
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself."
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
...dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-l-N-C-U
- S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats..."
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
- Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "l" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
- No, no, no.
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
- Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!
What do you mean?
- I was dead.
For seven minutes.
- Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maÏïtre d'?
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.
- All right.
- Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings." I knew what you meant with that.
- Lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
- Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
- Lf you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
- Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.
- What?
- Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
- My head.
It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
- What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a.m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
- What?
What do you get?
- You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90%% % of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
- Really?
- Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- She might like that.
- Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here...
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
- Good God, no.
- No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Twice a week.
Free weights.
- Okay.
All right.
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
- Yes.
I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great."
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi."
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
- Hey, will you come?
- What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.
- No.
That's...
- You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.
- No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
- No, like...
- Down there.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
- Why'd you move?
- London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
- Wife?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.
There's a.38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
- What the...
- Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care." You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
- Sorry.
What is that?
- My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...
- Come on!
...are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
- What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
- What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
...and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
- Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving..."
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious."
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert."
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
- You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I...
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.
- Yeah.
- And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
- How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this."
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.
- You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- I quit.
- You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
- You are through.
- What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
- Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- It's personal.
- I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.
- I'm a good listener.
Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?
- I'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
- No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
- What?
- She dumped him last night.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
- Is that a lot?
- No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No.
Definitely not.
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- I can't.
- Me, neither.
- Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
- Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
- You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- I love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range."
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- I don't.
- You do.
- Common expression?
- No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
- Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
- How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk."
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work."
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- I love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
- What?
- It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
- Hello.
- What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
- Hail.
- What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?
- Yeah.
- We're friends.
- Well...
- Associates.
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
- Yeah.
- We're close.
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.
- No.
- Sit down.
- Why?
- Just sit down.
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
- It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at your wives...
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
- What?
- Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
- Well...
- In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
- What?
What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
- Wait a minute.
- Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk."
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
- Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
- Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
I'm looking at a..."
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
–Careful with my table!
–Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
–Okay?
–Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
–There, good.
–See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself."
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's... –Oh, my God!
dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
–Did you see that?
–Someone call 911!
–Oh, my God, is he dead?
–He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
–Yeah, she really is.
–How long was the labor?
–Ten hours.
–Ten hours?
–Yeah.
–Oh, my God.
–That seems like a really long time.
–No, not really.
–It's not?
–Not really.
–See, that's, like, too long.
–It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
–Look at that.
–So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
–Yeah.
Holding.
–Thank you.
–Sorry!
–Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr Michael, Dr Michael to Pediatrics, please.
–Charts come back up, yet?
–They're there.
I appreciate it.
–Spell it.
–P-I-N-C-U-S.
–Date of birth?
–Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
–Last night or this morning?
–You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
–Why do you need to know that?
–Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
–Marital status?
–Pass.
–Profession?
–Irrelevant.
–Food allergies?
–I'm not gonna be eating here.
–Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
–What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
–Do you smoke?
–Stop it.
–Do you wear dentures?
–Madame, listen.
–When was the last time you ate?
–A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but... –Did you drink the laxative solution?
–Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
–Fine with me.
–Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
–Good morning, Dr Pincus.
–Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
–Okay.
–Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
–It's not necessary and we normally...
–Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
–Really?
–Yeah.
–Why do you look that tan?
–Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
–Looks natural.
–Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
–I don't know if...
–No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
–What are you...
–It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
–You gonna go darker?
–I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
–Yeah, that makes a difference.
–Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
–Makes people say crazy things.
–I haven't given it to him yet.
–Going in now.
–How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats..."
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
–I don't know anything about that.
–Right.
–Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
–All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
–Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
–Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
–He can see us!
–Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
–Idiot.
Get out of the road.
–Wait!
Hey!
–Listen, I just need two minutes...
–Look out!
of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
–Hey, man, you can see me.
–Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
–He can see us?
–Who?
That guy?
from the moment I left the hospital.
–What kind of side effects?
–Hallucinations.
–Okay, visual or aural?
–Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
–Did any...
–Did any what... –Sorry, but did anything...
–Where?
–Why do you just keep talking while...
–I didn't hear what... –Why do you keep interrupting me?
–No, well... –Did anything unusual happen...
–You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
–Just answer the...
–Just.
–Did anything unusual happen?
–Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
–Yeah.
–What?
–No.
–You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
–And if so...
–Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
–Yes?
–Me!
–What the...
What?
–Can you... –Can I...
Yes.
–Follow you?
–To the...
–To my office.
–And then you'll tell me.
–Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
–It was good.
Okay, normal.
–Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe, but after that, you responded...
–The cessation of what?
Dr Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
–Everyone's different.
–Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
–Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
–No.
–But, you know, technically...
–Yep.
medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
–You died.
–I died?
–Little bit.
–For how long?
–Seven minutes.
–A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
–A bit less.
–Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
–No, we did tell you.
We told you...
–No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
–No, I don't remember that.
–Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
–Nothing, I'm afraid.
–He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
–Is this your signature at the bottom?
–When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "I" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
–Thank you!
–Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
–Drive!
–No, no, no.
–Where to, buddy?
–Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
–That's perfect.
–My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
–Where do you want to go, pal?
–Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
–Campari and soda.
–Campari soda.
No.
–Pimm's Cup.
–Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
–Just get a real drink.
–Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
–Shut up.
–Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
–I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
–I died today!
What do you mean?
–I was dead.
For seven minutes.
–Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maitre d'?
–I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
–You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
–Sapphire martini up with olives.
–Thank you.
–Drink your drink.
–I'm gonna drink my drink.
–All right.
–Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
–You can take your BlackBerry with you?
–I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
–Not yet, but I keep trying.
–Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
–What kind of anesthetic did they use?
–They didn't want to use any.
–What?
–Yeah.
–Yeah?
–Yeah.
–Expected me...
–What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings." I knew what you meant with that.
–Lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
–We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
–She won't speak to her sister...
–Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
–Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
–You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
–Lf you would come through for me...
–I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
–It's Pink-Ass, right?
–Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
–It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
–Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
–It's all right, I can take a hint.
–It's not a hint.
–Good evening, Dr Pincus.
–Just go to hell.
–What?
–Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
–Dr Pincus?
–Back off!
–Sorry?
–Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
–Bless you.
–Oh, God.
Thank you.
–Bless you.
–Thank you.
–Bless you.
–Thank you.
–Bless you.
–Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
–My head.
It's throbbing.
–I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
–Pass.
–What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
–You don't want to at least help Gwen?
–She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a.m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
–What?
What do you get?
–You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
–No, it's you I loathe.
–Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance to connect with another human being...
–Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90% of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
–And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
–No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
–I've never seen her before.
–One of those things?
–You stole her cab, remember?
–I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
–Really?
–Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
–Give her another option.
–I don't get it.
–Present her with an alternative.
–Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need... –Don't need a male model or a fireman.
–Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
–Really?
–Yeah.
–She might like that.
–Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
–Really?
–Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
–I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
–Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here... –I'm sorry.
–Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
–Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
–Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
–Good God, no.
–No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
–So you use hookers.
–No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or... –Yeah?
–Yeah.
–Twice a week.
Free weights.
–Okay.
All right.
–You got a nice, thick head of hair.
–Protein shampoo.
–She's gonna like that.
–Yeah.
–Look after your scalp.
–Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or... –You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
–No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
–Yeah.
–I know.
–What?
–I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
–Yes.
I came straight from work.
–Okay.
–I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
–Yeah.
Yeah.
–This is how we do it, baby.
–Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
–Oh, really?
Did she?
–Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
–Don't remember the second one.
–Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
–Was that you?
–It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
–Bertram Pincus, DDS.
–So I've read.
–I enjoyed your lecture very much.
–Thank you.
–Don't take the walk-outs personally.
–I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
–Atrocious dental hygiene.
–I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
–Right, and it scared her.
–I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
–What the hell is your problem?
–I don't have a problem.
–Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
–No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
–Yeah, they suck.
–Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great."
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
–This will make her absolutely nuts.
–Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
–Hi.
–I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi."
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
–Okay.
–Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
–It's okay.
–It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna... –For the love of God!
–4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so... –Great.
Okay.
–Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
–I'm sorry.
–No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
–His organ?
–Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
–Sure.
–It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
–You okay?
–Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
–No, no.
–Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
–Hey, will you come?
–What?
–Big opening with loads of people...
–Yeah.
–No.
That's...
–You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
–This is my lucky day.
–Yeah.
–No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
–More, yeah.
–No, like...
–Down there.
–Isn't that amazing?
–Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
–They imported it from North Africa.
–Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
–Have you lived in the building long?
–Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then... –Why'd you move?
–London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
–What's her name?
–Sarah.
–Wife?
–No.
–Girlfriend?
–Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
–But that's not funny.
–Funnier than the truth.
–Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
–Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just... –Should I make an appointment?
–No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
–Can you tell what it is?
–It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
–You should come and see me.
–Should I?
–You have to finish it for me.
–Yeah.
There's a.38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
–Maybe I will.
–Okay.
–What the...
–Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
–Yeah, it's just the...
–'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
–Hey, honey.
–Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
–Hi.
–Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
–She's really cute.
–Don't... –Doctor?
–Yes, love to.
–Great.
–I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
–I hope it was edible.
–Best curry I've ever tasted.
–Stop complimenting him!
–You're too kind.
–Where did you learn to cook?
–Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care." You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
–Sorry.
What is that?
–My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
–I need you to punch him.
–But what we really need... –Come on!
are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
–That tent pole stuck up his ass.
–Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
–Shut...
–What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
–Except the Chinese.
–What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other things like Kwok...
–Stop it.
You're gonna... and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong... –Stop, please, stop.
and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes and the government will only allow...
–Not again.
their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
–I'm sorry.
–I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
–No, not at all.
–Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
–Are you all right?
Do you want to...
–Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
–I'll have a drink, though.
–Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
–Pimm's Cup for the lady.
–Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving..."
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
–Someone I really hate.
–Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
–I was?
–Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
–Come on, then.
–Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
–No, no, no, you walked her into that.
–"Obnoxious."
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert."
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
–So do I. –You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
–I'll bet he was.
–But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I... –That must feel...
–Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
–Good night.
–Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
–Saw what?
–Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
–Yeah.
–And they're eating.
–Yeah.
–And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
–How convenient, right?
–Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this."
–Yeah?
–And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
–He took five grand from her.
–He what?
Yeah. $5·000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
–I don't know.
–Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
–What was it, AIDS?
–No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
–You're missing the point.
–Yeah.
–You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
–Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
–She loves him.
–She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
–I quit.
–You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy, but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
–I have no clue what to say...
–Head back.
but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
–Okay.
–Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
–You are through.
–What about the...
What about what?
–Frank.
–Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a... –No, no, he'll run.
–That's him!
–Dentist, don't piss me off!
–Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr Pincus.
–Yes, we've met.
–Oh, hi.
–Thanks for seeing me.
–Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
–I came home and Gwen was...
–What?
–Gwen was...
–Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just... –No, forget about it.
–No, I can't forget about it.
–Just...
–Well, it's nothing.
–Can we just get this...
–Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know... –It's personal.
–I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
–Why don't we just...
–"Finish what you started" is my motto.
–I'm a good listener.
Please.
–I'd rather not talk about it.
–Can we just...
–Well, can you wait a minute then?
–I'm in pain.
–Please.
Dr Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
–I'm from India.
–Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
–Doctor, I'm with a patient.
–Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something... –No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
–Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
–That hurts.
–Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
–Sugar?
–Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
–Are there any side effects?
–A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
–They used live ammo.
–Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
–What?
–She dumped him last night.
–How do you know?
–He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
–Is that a lot?
–No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
–I mean, young couples at this stage...
–No.
Definitely not.
–Very normal for them to start...
–No, no, no.
to get into this...
–She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
–Well, this is great news.
–Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
–I can't.
–Me, neither.
–Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
–Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
–Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
–It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
–I bought her over the years?
–I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus, you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
–Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
–You gonna finish?
–Done.
–Okay.
–The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
–Until then, this is our fond farewell.
–Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
–I love it!
–Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those, but sorry, a little bit out of my price range."
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
–I don't.
–You do.
–Common expression?
–No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
–Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
–Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
–Don't tell me to take it easy.
–You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
–It'll sound crazy.
–Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
–How do you get like you?
–Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk."
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric, needs a little work."
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
–I love you.
–Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
–What?
–It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
–You idiot!
–I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
–Hello.
–What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
–Hail.
–What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
–No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
–Jahangir?
–Yeah.
–We're friends.
–Well...
–Associates.
–Yeah.
–We have things in common.
–Yeah.
–We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
–Yeah.
–We're close.
–No, I wouldn't say that.
–Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
–What are we doing?
–Just sit down.
–No.
–Sit down.
–Why?
–Just sit down.
–Oh, look, never mind.
–This is important.
Look.
–Brilliant.
–The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick, what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay... –Yes, they can let him go.
–You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
–It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
–Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
–I don't care.
–I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
–How about that?
–No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs and talked about your girlfriends...
–Oh, my God.
and laughed at your wives... –I swear.
–What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
–What?
–Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
–Well...
–In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
–Is that what you want me to believe?
–What do you want to tell him?
–What do you want to say?
–I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
–What?
What'd he say?
–He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
–Heartfelt.
–Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
–I can't check with him.
–Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
–What's happening?
–You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
–Feels good.
–I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
–This is the worst part.
–Somebody do... –Watching her cry.
–Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
–Wait a minute.
–You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
–Wait a minute.
–Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk."
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
–You went darker.
–I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
–Hi.
–Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr Prashar.
–Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
–Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
–Sorry?
What?
–Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.
Hello?
is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"l'm looking at a..."
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know. I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up forthis thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go. I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
-Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right. I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
diy. "Do lt Yourself."
Oh, no!
Call me overthe weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
...dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
-He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theaterwatching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his fatherto see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule fortomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to botheryou.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
-Yeah, she really is.
-How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
-Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
-No, not really.
- lt's not?
-Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- lt's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
-Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
-Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-l-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
-Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night orthis morning?
-You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed perweek?
-Why do you need to know that?
-Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- l'm not gonna be eating here.
-Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
-What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
-When was the last time you ate?
-A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
-Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were... I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
-Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on yourfeet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical forthis type of procedure.
- lt's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
-Yeah.
-Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
-Yes. lt's betterforyou.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- l don't know if...
-No, I don't want to smell yourfake tan!
-What are you...
- lt's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
-You gonna go darker?
- l think I am. I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get yourteeth whitened like I did.
-Yeah, that makes a difference.
-Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- l haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
-How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people, I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats..."
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night, I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- l don't know anything about that.
- Right.
-Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
-All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
-Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
-He can see us!
-Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
-Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of yourtime!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
-Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
-He can see us?
-Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
-What kind of side effects?
-Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
-Where?
-Why do you just keep talking while...
- l didn't hearwhat...
-Why do you keep interrupting me?
-No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
-You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
-Just answerthe...
-Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
-Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
-Yeah.
-What?
-No.
-You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
-And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
-Yes?
- Me!
-What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
-And then you'll tell me.
-Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- lt was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but afterthat, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
-Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
-Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
-No.
- But, you know, technically...
-Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
-You died.
- l died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
-A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
-A bit less.
-Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
Forthe record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
-No, we did tell you.
We told you...
-No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
-No, I don't rememberthat.
-Yes.
Yeah, we... lt says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
-Nothing, I'm afraid.
-He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- ls this your signature at the bottom?
-When did I sign that?
Right afteryou passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state ofNew York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "l" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No. I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
-No, no, no.
-Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
-Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
-Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
-Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust. I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
- l've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- l died today!
What do you mean?
- l was dead.
For seven minutes.
-Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maître d'?
- l'm gonna ignore that, okay?
-You shouldn't.
You wearwhat you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
- Drink your drink.
- l'm gonna drink my drink.
-All right.
-Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and... lt's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
-You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- l guess.
What, have you got a signal?
-Not yet, but I keep trying.
-Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
-What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.
-What?
-Yeah.
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
- Expected me...
-What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings." l knew what you meant with that.
- lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
-We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whateveryou do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good. I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
- Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
-You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
- lf you would come through for me...
- l'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- lt's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- lt's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
-Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
- lt's all right, I can take a hint.
- lt's not a hint.
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
-Just go to hell.
-What?
- ls this a bad time?
My letterwent underthe carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't... I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just... I'm not very well. lt's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
- My head. lt's throbbing.
- l'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
-What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
-You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out, I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be herthing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a.m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
-What?
What do you get?
-You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
-No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance
-to connect with another human being...
- Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90% of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
-And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
-No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them foryou, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Orwe send her an anonymous letter from his otherfamily.
- l've never seen her before.
- One of those things?
-You stole her cab, remember?
- l've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hearwhat she's got to say.
- Really?
-Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
- Give her another option.
- l don't get it.
- Present herwith an alternative.
-Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
-Yeah.
- She might like that.
-Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
-Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- l'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here...
- l'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay. I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really. I can do this. I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
- Good God, no.
-No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
- So you use hookers.
-No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may rememberwas the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go foryou.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
- Twice a week.
Free weights.
- Okay.
All right.
-You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
-Yeah.
- Look afteryour scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
-You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
-No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go overthere when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
-Yeah.
- l know.
-What?
- l don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
-Yes. I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- l'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And rememberthat the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughterwent to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab orfor not holding the elevator?
- Don't rememberthe second one.
- Oh, no, no. I know.
Maybe it was forthat time that you told the superthat somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
-Was that you?
- lt was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight orten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" orwhatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
- l enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- l hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you forthat encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
-Atrocious dental hygiene.
- l'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- l'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
-What the hell is your problem?
- l don't have a problem.
-Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
-No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
-Yeah, they suck.
-Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it. lt's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they... I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, forthe sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great."
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to orderfor her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't evertell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
-Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show heryou care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
-Hi.
- l'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi."
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- lt's okay.
- lt seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
- Forthe love of God!
-4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- l'm sorry.
-No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt forthe big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
-His organ?
-Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- lt's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God. I can see why he was king.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez. I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
-No, no.
-Yeah.
is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but... I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
-Hey, will you come?
-What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
-Yeah.
-No.
That's...
-You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
-Yeah.
-No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
-No, like...
- Down there.
- lsn't that amazing?
-Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin. lt's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
-Have you lived in the building long?
- Fouryears and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
-Why'd you move?
- London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
-What's her name?
- Sarah.
-Wife?
-No.
- Girlfriend?
-Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to herforyears.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up. I was joking.
- But that's not funny.
- Funnierthan the truth.
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
-Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can neverfind my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hearthat.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
- Should I make an appointment?
-No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
- Can you tell what it is?
- lt's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life, I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
-You should come and see me.
- Should I?
-You have to finish it for me.
-Yeah.
There's a.38 snub-nose taped underthe seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
-What the...
- ls now a good time?
is everything okay?
-Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
-Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
-Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
-Yes, love to.
- Great.
- l'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
- l hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've evertasted.
- Stop complimenting him!
-You're too kind.
-Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with hertime.
Richard's being modest.
He worked forthree years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor, I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care." You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
- Sorry.
What is that?
- My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
- l need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...
- Come on!
...are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
-What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
-What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not theirfaces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
-things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
...and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
-Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- l'm sorry.
- l'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
-No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long lsland.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
-Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now orwe could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some airwith some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- l'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new... I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup forthe lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving..."
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate. lt's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
- Someone I really hate.
-Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- l was?
-Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remembertheirfaults.
Oh, well, I rememberthem.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me. I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
-No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious."
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert."
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
-You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
- l'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "l want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry. I...
- That must feel...
-Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for herwork, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's orthink it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling yourway right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got betterthings to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
-Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
-Yeah.
-And they're eating.
-Yeah.
-And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
-How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes overto go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this."
-Yeah?
-And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are otherthings!
-He took five grand from her.
-He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw herwrite the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- l don't know.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-What was it, aids?
-No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
-You're missing the point.
-Yeah.
-You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
-Yeah.
A lawyerwho fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon herto this creep.
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And afterwhat she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are. I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- l quit.
-You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- l have no clue what to say...
-Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these overto the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of... I thought I was through forthe day afterthis.
-You are through.
-What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
-Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
-No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the... I mean, I finished earlierthan I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands. I'm Dr. Pincus.
-Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
-Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm... I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- l came home and Gwen was...
-What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
-No, forget about it.
-No, I can't forget about it.
-Just...
-Well, it's nothing.
- Can we just get this...
-Well, it is something oryou wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- lt's personal.
- l know that, but, I mean just to... I'd rather not talk about it.
-Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.
- l'm a good listener.
Please.
- l'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
-Well, can you wait a minute then?
- l'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- l'm from India.
-Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm aHindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as aHindu person, I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
-Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
-No, I wasn't. I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take yourword forthat.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world forteeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
-Are there any side effects?
-Afew.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet oryou need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
-What?
- She dumped him last night.
-How do you know?
-He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about herfeelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
- ls that a lot?
-No. lt's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
- l mean, young couples at this stage...
-No.
Definitely not.
-Very normal forthem to start...
-No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right afterthe exhibition opens.
-Well, this is great news.
-Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- l can't.
- Me, neither.
-Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
-Nothing.
is that from a jewelry store?
- Oh, my gosh. is that for Gwen?
- lt doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "l will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me"jewelry
- l bought her overthe years?
- l can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
-you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Ourtime together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
-You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
-Until then, this is ourfond farewell.
-Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic. lt's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- l love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range."
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- l don't.
-You do.
- Common expression?
-No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
- Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
-You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- lt'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes... lt's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
-How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he nevertold anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top, I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times afterthat, I thought, "What a jerk."
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work."
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in orderto get close to me, orfor God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- l love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
-What?
- lt's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letterwent underthe carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just underthe front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
-You idiot!
- l'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
-Hello.
-What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
-Hail.
-What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
-No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
-Jahangir?
-Yeah.
-We're friends.
-Well...
-Associates.
-Yeah.
-We have things in common.
-Yeah.
-We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
-Yeah.
-We're close.
-No, I wouldn't say that.
-Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whateverthe hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally. lt's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
-What are we doing?
-Just sit down.
-No.
- Sit down.
-Why?
-Just sit down.
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories, I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
-Yes, they can let him go.
-You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't. lt's not him. lt's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
- lt was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
-Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- l don't care.
- l told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
-How about that?
-No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at yourwives...
- l swear.
-What was the matterwith me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you. I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
-What?
-Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
-Well...
- ln all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
- ls that what you want me to believe?
-What do you want to tell him?
-What do you want to say?
- l want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter afteryou die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And... I'm so sorry, honey.
-What?
What'd he say?
-He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
-Heartfelt.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess. I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
- l can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right. I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
-What's happening?
-You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- l was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
-Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
-Wait a minute.
-You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
-Wait a minute.
- Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are foryou, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk."
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
-You went darker.
- l went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Underthe circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship overthere at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not. I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
- Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
-Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that foryou.

Wait till they get you in the back.
Dr. Pincus.
Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
Okay.
Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
It's not necessary and we normally Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
Really?
Yeah.
Why do you look that tan?
Thanks for noticing.

Not like a garbage dirt.
You gonna go darker?

that makes a difference.
Very nice.
I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
huh?
Makes people say crazy things.
I haven't given it to him yet.
Going in now.
How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Dr. Pincus? I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
when I was a little girl. take a look at all these lonely cats
What a wonderful man he must have been.
listen. but I wasn't.
Who were they?
I don't know anything about that.
Right.
thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
Are you speaking to me?
not you.

I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.

Unbelievable.

That guy?
from the moment I left the hospital.
What kind of side effects?
Hallucinations.

Both.

Really.
I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
Did any Did any what but did anything Where?
Why do you just keep talking while I didn't hear what well
Did anything unusual happen You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
Just answer the Just.
Did anything unusual happen?

Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
Yeah.
What?
No.
You said "yes" first.

Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
And if so Can you hold on one
Can you hold on a second?

Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.

Little bit.
For how long?
Seven minutes.
A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
A bit less.
Approximately seven
That's really the only thing that I can think of
How did I die?
we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia. of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore. we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
we
It says here that you gurgled to me a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
I'm afraid.
He's perked up.
Go on.
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
Is this your signature at the bottom?
When did I sign that? legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "I" with a little love heart!
right?
about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
got a sec?
huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.

My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
pal?
Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.

you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
Campari and soda.
Campari soda.
No.
Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup.

I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
I can wait I died today!
What do you mean?
I was dead.
For seven minutes.
Yeah?
I can that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts. too. which is why we're still here.
we can't talk to the living and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maître d'?
okay?
You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
Drink your drink.
I'm gonna drink my drink.
All right.
Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.

Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
You can take your BlackBerry with you?
I guess.

but I keep trying.
Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all
I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
What kind of anesthetic did they use?
They didn't want to use any.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Expected me What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings." I knew what you meant with that.
I just We're not gonna be hanging out!
young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.

Come on.

You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic. you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
If you would come through for me I'm not listening anymore.
but I will if I have to.
right?
Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.

She lives right Widow.

She's getting married in a couple of months bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.

Okay.
You need time.
I can take a hint.
It's not a hint.
Dr. Pincus.
Just go to hell.
What?
Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
and I know where it is.
but that's nuts! did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
she won't nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's
Leave me alone.
Dr. Pincus?

You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.

Frankie spent some time on the couch.
dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance to connect with another human being Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90% of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did. okay?
Problem solved.
okay.
The mummy's been examined
but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
I've never seen her before.
One of those things?
then.
man.
a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
Really?
Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
Give her another option.
I don't get it.
I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model don't need right?
just approachable.
Sort of rugged and somebody tough.
if anything and sensitive.
though. and that would be attractive.
Really?
Yeah.
She might like that.
Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
no.
Average.
Really?
Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
you mean you.
I'm Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here
I'm sorry.
Forget it.
a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
it might work.
all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
you know?
Pulling the strings.
I think I can do it.
Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
Forget it.
are you?
no.
No?
You got a girlfriend?
currently.
I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
you work out or
Yeah?
Yeah.
Twice a week.
Free weights.
Okay.
All right.
thick head of hair.
Protein shampoo.
She's gonna like that.
Yeah.
Look after your scalp.
Right.
you know?
you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or don't you?
No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do. and strike up a conversation with her.
Yeah.
I know.
What?
I don't know.
better not.
Yes.
I came straight from work.
Okay.
I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
Yeah.
Yeah.
baby.
Okay.

thank you very much for coming.
it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
yeah.
all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
Was that you?
It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous. and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
D.D.S. So I've read.
I enjoyed your lecture very much.
Thank you.
Don't take the walk-outs personally.
I hadn't noticed.
thank you for that encouragement.
quite a few.
What do they know?
Atrocious dental hygiene.
I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
and it scared her.
I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
no.
Let me preface this.
What the hell is your problem?
I don't have a problem.
no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
they suck.
Would you quit banging that drum?
bad lady went and broke your heart?
get over it.
It's in the past.
do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
the thing with women is that they
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much. you do great with women.
You do great.
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Pincus.
This will make her absolutely nuts.
Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
don't you?
Yeah.
you got to show her you care.
got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
and she's no dummy.
she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
Hi.
I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to Okay.
Pincus.
you're not ready.
okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking. and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi.
Gingivitis?
but essentially if I
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
all right.
Not a total disaster.
you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
shall we?
Okay.
Okay.
tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
dock.
either.
Busy bee.
commitments abound.
Rawhide.
No way is that gonna so
Great.
Okay.
Good.
See you then.
God.
thank God you're back.
you sadist!
forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
is that a new shirt?
and it's got sleeves.
well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big
Hi.
Hi.
yeah.
huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him. fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you. and it's what's underneath that counts.
they suctioned his brain out through his nose. intestines
Beautiful.
so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
Sure.
It's the way it was stored.
the penis and the heart are kept together they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
You okay?
Yeah.
eventually.
geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
no.
Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him? he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
the mouth.
A coin in the mouth. but and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
will you come?
What?
Big opening with loads of people Yeah.
No.
That's You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
This is my lucky day.
Yeah.
yeah.
like Down there.
Isn't that amazing?
Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
good. it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
Have you lived in the building long?
Four years and one month.
and then
Why'd you move?
London.
Just too much.
just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
What's her name?
Sarah.
Wife?
No.
Girlfriend?
Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
But that's not funny.
Funnier than the truth.
and the truth about Sarah is Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second? and I can never find my keys.
just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.

You should come and see me.
Should I?
You have to finish it for me.
Yeah.
There's a.38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.

Hey!
Good.
Another one.

I didn't see you.

Really?
That's fantastic.
myself.
Doctor?
At Gwen's.

You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah. and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
I'm the only one giving for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
do you wanna leave?
no.
He should leave.
Let's do some You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
I remember them.
let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
then.
Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Frank could be a little controlling.
that's what made me successful.
so say so.
he was occasionally obnoxious.
I imagine.
you walked her into that.
"Obnoxious.

Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish. up the
Right. "Pervert.
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
So do I. You mind?
aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics? was he?
he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
I'll bet he was.
But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
this is shaping up nicely.
obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine? like a normal person.
I'm sorry.
I
That must feel Unfinished.
Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
Good night.
Good night.

What happens matters.
but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
I just I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer. you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork? and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
Saw what?
Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
that's He's okay?
Yeah.
And they're eating. and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.

Right. let me get this.

It was wasn't he?

AIDS?
No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
You're missing the point.
Yeah.
he's a lawyer.
Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
what am I doing here?
I'm out.
no.
What do you mean?
I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her. and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
She loves him.
She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants. she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it. and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
I quit.
You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.

You are through.

Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.

Thanks for seeing me.
Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.

Open up.

you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
I came home and Gwen was What?
never mind.
you were gonna say something about she was just
I can't forget about it.
it's nothing.
it is something you know I mean just to
I'd rather not talk about it.
Why don't we just "Finish what you started" is my motto.
I'm a good listener.
Please.
I'd rather not talk about it.
can you wait a minute then?
I'm in pain.
Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
aren't you?
Excuse me.
I'm from India.
Yeah.
like us.
I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile? I would ask them politely.
I just need a technique.
I'm with a patient.
Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something yeah.
Tooth.
yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
Sugar?
Secrets.
you will feel better.
it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
Are there any side effects?
A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
They used live ammo.
Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
What?
She dumped him last night.
How do you know?
He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings so
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
Is that a lot?
No.
It's not fatal till 750.
I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
young couples at this stage No.
Definitely not.
no.
to get into this She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
right after the exhibition opens.
this is great news.
Yeah.
I guess.
neither.
wait!
What's in the bag?
Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
It doesn't matter.
whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
I'm sorry.
you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
I bought her over the years?
I can take it from here! I'm telling you!
Frank!
Listen!
has been rather unpleasant. at least
You gonna finish?
Done. we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
we meet up again.
but
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
he thinks it's all his fault.
therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings a little bit out of my price range.
So
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
nothing ostentatious or pushy. and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
I don't.
You do.
Common expression?
No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
Frank's favorite drink?
take it easy.
Don't tell me to take it easy.
You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
no choice. and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
It'll sound crazy.
Try her.
Try me. but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes with us.
it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
you must have known Frank.
maybe you were his dentist.
then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
How do you get like you?
Please.
you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
but me.
What was it?
Drowning. no matter how hard I swam. he couldn't.
isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
What a jerk.
right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you. needs a little work.
But to use intimate details about my dead husband that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
I love you.
Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
Dentist.
What?
It's my daughter.
you mentioned something about that.
her only sister. but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
aren't you?
a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
they just can't see it. because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
we stay alone.
isn't it?
You idiot!
I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
Hello.
What a day.
it appears that winter is upon us.
Hail.
What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
I suppose that is the stupidest.
Jahangir?
Yeah.
We're friends.
Well Associates.
Yeah.
We have things in common.
Yeah.
We share stuff and for example.
Yeah.
We're close.
but What the is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
What are we doing?
Just sit down.
No.
Sit down.
Why?
Just sit down.
never mind.
This is important.
Look.
Brilliant.
The other one.
that's good. and ask yourself the ultimate question.
This business of what is it really getting me?
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
I didn't
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
not why did they put it in a big
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay they can let him go.
You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Gwen.
Let him go.
then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you. it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
stop following me.
it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
okay?
I'm trying to
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
no and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs my God.
and laughed at your wives
I swear.
What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
have you?
What?
Useless.
change? ever?
just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
Is that what you want me to believe?
What do you want to tell him?
What do you want to say?
I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And
honey.
What?
What'd he say?
He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
it was
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
is he?
that's convenient.
it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
okay?
self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
I've lived more in the last few days the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
my God.
Now that is a real shame.
too.
pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
right?
I'm not dead!
I'm afraid so.
kiddo.
you.
Kind of nice.
Feels good.
I was just getting started!
every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
This is the worst part.
Somebody do
Watching her cry.
Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
Wait a minute.
You got to be kidding me.
call them!
Wait a minute.
Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Lord!
Spare this man!
I really can't take this guy anymore.
I can't.
Come on!
there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why? now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
always good to see you.
What happened?
"Don't walk.
I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here? security would have escorted her off the premises.
guys.
yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
six months.
only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
Hi.
Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
but they wouldn't they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
I didn't know
He's a lovely man.
but don't tell him I said so.
I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
Sorry?
What?
Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
his dad's not there. and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.

Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a... "
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself. "
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
... dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats... "
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
- Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "i" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
- No, no, no.
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
- Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!
What do you mean?
- I was dead.
For seven minutes.
- Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maÏïtre d'?
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.
- All right.
- Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings. " I knew what you meant with that.
- If we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
- Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
- If you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
- Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.
- What?
- Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
- My head.
It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
- What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a. m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
- What?
What do you get?
- You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90%% % of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
- Really?
- Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- She might like that.
- Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here...
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
- Good God, no.
- No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Twice a week.
Free weights.
- Okay.
All right.
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
- Yes.
I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great. "
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi. "
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
- Hey, will you come?
- What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.
- No.
That's...
- You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.
- No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
- No, like...
- Down there.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
- Why'd you move?
- London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
- Wife?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.
There's a.38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
- What the...
- Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care. " You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
- Sorry.
What is that?
- My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...
- Come on!
... are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
- What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
- What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
... and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
- Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving... "
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious. "
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert. "
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
- You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I...
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.
- Yeah.
- And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
- How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this. "
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.
- You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- I quit.
- You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
- You are through.
- What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
- Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- It's personal.
- I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.
- I'm a good listener.
Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?
- I'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
- No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
- What?
- She dumped him last night.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
- Is that a lot?
- No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No.
Definitely not.
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- I can't.
- Me, neither.
- Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
- Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
- You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- I love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range. "
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- I don't.
- You do.
- Common expression?
- No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
- Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
- How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk. "
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work. "
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- I love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
- What?
- It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
- Hello.
- What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
- Hail.
- What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?
- Yeah.
- We're friends.
- Well...
- Associates.
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
- Yeah.
- We're close.
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.
- No.
- Sit down.
- Why?
- Just sit down.
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
- It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at your wives...
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
- What?
- Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
- Well...
- In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
- What?
What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
- Wait a minute.
- Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying,
those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk. "
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
- Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
- Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a..."
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself."
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
...dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-l-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats..."
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
- Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "l" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
- No, no, no.
- Where to, buddy?
- Don't do that!
You're a busy little guy.
Let me get right to the point.
That woman whose cab you just snaked, that's my wife.
- That's perfect.
- My widow.
She's got a very serious problem.
I need your help to fix it.
- Where do you want to go, pal?
- Tell him 54th and Madison.
I don't want to go to 54th and Madison!
Okay, that narrows it down.
I don't want a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Okay, that narrows it down.
Yeah, you're making kind of a fool out of yourself.
You can't talk to me when somebody's standing there.
- Campari and soda.
- Campari soda.
No.
- Pimm's Cup.
- Pimm's Cup.
Pimm's Cup?
Pimm's?
- Just get a real drink.
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay!
Sorry.
Can I have the first thing I said?
Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Shut up.
- Wow.
You need to adjust, right?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
You need a little time to adjust.
I get it.
I haven't done jack in 14 months.
- I've been here, believe me, I can wait...
- I died today!
What do you mean?
- I was dead.
For seven minutes.
- Yeah?
And then when they brought me back, I can...
Yeah, well, look, that's the thing.
New York is lousy with ghosts.
I mean, they're everywhere, and they're a noisy, pushy, demanding bunch, same as when they were alive, and frustrated, too.
The dead have a lot of unfinished business, which is why we're still here.
And normally, we can't talk to the living and, suddenly, you come along, and you can imagine.
A lot of excitement.
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you a maître d'?
- I'm gonna ignore that, okay?
- You shouldn't.
You wear what you died in.
At least I look nice.
- Sapphire martini up with olives.
- Thank you.
- Drink your drink.
- I'm gonna drink my drink.
- All right.
- Just shut up.
Aesthetically pleasing.
Am I still dead?
I'm still dead, aren't I?
This is heaven.
Can't be heaven, you wouldn't be here.
I'm lying on the operating table, they're gonna bring me around, and...
It's all gonna be a dream.
Yeah.
Don't overthink it.
You were gone, now you're back.
Have a drink.
Have another one.
God knows I would if I could.
- You can take your BlackBerry with you?
- I guess.
What, have you got a signal?
- Not yet, but I keep trying.
- Not yet.
Thank goodness I downloaded Tetris before I went.
Damn it!
How'd you die?
Something went wrong with the anesthetic.
I went in for a colonoscopy and it went all...
Yeah, I never got one of those.
I don't think you have to worry about it now.
- What kind of anesthetic did they use?
- They didn't want to use any.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Expected me...
- What about your ass feelings?
Don't actually say "ass feelings." I knew what you meant with that.
- lf we're gonna be hanging out, I just...
- We're not gonna be hanging out!
May I ask you a question, young man?
It's about my daughter.
She lives in Far Rockaway.
- She won't speak to her sister...
- Back off, Marjorie!
All right?
I'm talking to him.
Whatever you do, don't talk to them.
I certainly see no harm in making a request of the young man.
How about the fact that I found him first?
Look what you did.
You upset him.
No, no, you, you, you, you, you.
Yeah, very good.
I know you're there.
Let's start over, huh?
Come on.
You had a rough day.
You're tense, you're keyed up.
You do yoga?
You do yoga?
My girlfriend's got a studio.
I'll show you where it is.
Girlfriend?
I thought you said you were married.
Did I say I was a perfect person?
- Come on, let's hail a cab.
She's hot.
- You don't exist, okay?
You're the bizarre aftereffects of some poorly-administered anesthetic.
I'm gonna go home to bed, and when I wake up in the morning, with any luck, you'll be gone.
That would be truly rotten luck for my wife who just needs a little bit of your help.
- lf you would come through for me...
- I'm not listening anymore.
Hey, I don't want to play hardball with you, but I will if I have to.
- It's Pink-Ass, right?
- Pincus.
Pincus?
Pincus?
This is a matter of life or death.
- It's my wife, okay?
She lives right...
- Widow.
She lives right here in this building, all right?
She's getting married in a couple of months to a real scumbag lawyer, a bad, bad guy.
Somebody's got to stop this.
What do you care?
You were having an affair.
Never been married, right?
Okay.
You need time.
- It's all right, I can take a hint.
- It's not a hint.
- Good evening, Dr. Pincus.
- Just go to hell.
- What?
- Is this a bad time?
My letter went under the carpet.
He lost something important, and I know where it is.
She won't wear a helmet because of me, but that's nuts!
Gee, I'm sorry, Doctor, did I accidentally give everybody your home address?
If you don't help her, she won't...
I got to tell you, nobody was more excited than Naked Guy.
He's...
Leave me alone.
- Dr. Pincus?
- Back off!
- Sorry?
- Oh, sorry.
Never mind.
- Bless you.
- Oh, God.
Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
- Bless you.
- Stop it.
If I sneeze again, I'll assume...
Thank you.
Just...
I'm not very well.
It's not you.
It's a bit you.
Mainly...
You can't...
But you're adding.
Don't you see, Pincus, there's a reason I'm here and this is it.
I mean, this slimeball, he's using Gwen, trying to get his hands on her money.
I left her a good chunk of change, you know.
- My head.
It's throbbing.
- I'm like her guardian angel.
You can be the guardian angel's assistant.
- Pass.
- What?
You don't want to help me earn my wings?
I don't care.
- You don't want to at least help Gwen?
- She's beyond help, okay?
She chose you, didn't she?
And now she's got a new slimeball, and if that doesn't work out,
I'm sure another Mr. Wrong will come along, 'cause that seems to be her thing.
Now, leave me alone.
I've got a crown at 8:00 a.m.
I see!
I understand, I get it.
- What?
What do you get?
- You.
Just this whole self-loathing thing.
- No, it's you I loathe.
- Oh, please.
Frankie spent some time on the couch.
You know, dentists have one of the highest suicide rates of any other profession.
But this might really give you a chance
- to connect with another human being...
- Shut up.
Shut up!
Okay?
Don't you understand?
I don't give a shit!
I like what I do.
Do you know why?
It suits me.
Because 90% of the people I come into contact with have cotton wool shoved in their mouths.
I'm not interested in their political opinions.
I don't care what they thought of Spamalot.
I don't care about their lives.
I just like the quiet!
You are a sad little man.
- And you're a lying, bigamist corpse.
- No, no, I'm not a bigamist.
I'm an adulterer.
It's a whole different thing.
Sorry, my mistake.
You were a real catch.
Come on.
You don't think I'm gonna find you in a hotel?
This is crazy, all right?
You want your quiet life back?
I'll make you a deal.
Okay?
I'll talk to them for you, get them to leave you alone.
I'm good at talking people into things.
It's what I do.
Did.
Look, you do this one thing for me, you'll never see any of us ever again, okay?
Problem solved.
Yeah, okay.
The mummy's been examined by virologists, oncologists, forensic pathologists, searching for signs of foul play, but Pepi the Third's cause of death at the relatively young age of 23 still remains a mystery.
It can't be that hard to break up a relationship.
I used to screw these things up all the time.
Maybe we ought to just hire a broad to seduce him and videotape it, you know?
That woman lives in my building?
Or we send her an anonymous letter from his other family.
- I've never seen her before.
- One of those things?
- You stole her cab, remember?
- I've never noticed her, then.
Never noticed her?
Open your eyes, man.
What are you, a brain in a jar?
Okay.
I want to hear what she's got to say.
- Really?
- Yes.
And the grand manner in which Mummy 1999.1.4 was preserved also suggests that he was embalmed by royal mummifiers, as opposed to curbside-marketplace perverts...
Preservists.
That's awkward.
I suppose the simplest way to break it up would be to plant a seed of doubt in her mind.
- Give her another option.
- I don't get it.
- Present her with an alternative.
- Yeah, yeah, I thought of that.
You mean hire a good-looking male model...
Don't hire anyone.
Don't...
No, don't need...
- Don't need a male model or a fireman.
- Somebody handsome, right?
Not too handsome.
Not chiseled, just approachable.
Sort of...
'Cause I was thinking, like, rugged and somebody tough.
...round-faced, if anything and sensitive.
Well, he's gonna have to have a lot of cash, though.
If he's sensible with his money, he's probably invested well, and that would be attractive.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- She might like that.
- Yeah.
But he's gonna have to be tall.
Tall is important.
No, no, no, no, no, he's not.
No, no.
Average.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Bordering on the short.
Oh, my word, you mean you.
- I'm...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Forget it.
Don't walk away mad!
Come here!
Pink-Ass!
I would like to elaborate further on Mummy 1999.1.4's burial site.
Here...
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
That's okay.
I mean, a lot of great ideas sound completely ridiculous at first.
Sorry I even brought it up.
I'm still thinking about it.
You know, it might work.
I mean, all you're gonna have to do is be charming enough to give her a few second thoughts, you know?
Be a challenge.
Almost impossible.
But I'd be there, you know?
Pulling the strings.
Guy in the bushes calling the plays.
You know, I think I can do it.
- Really.
I can do this.
I can do it.
- Forget it.
No, no, no, you're not...
You're not married, are you?
- Good God, no.
- No?
You got a girlfriend?
No, just between us, currently.
- So you use hookers.
- No, I don't use hookers.
We've also conducted extensive CT scans to search for orthopedic trauma, which may have led to infection, as you may remember was the case with Tutankhamen as shown here on slide 43.
Nope, nope, you know what?
It's possible that she could actually go for you.
I mean, she likes athletic guys.
I mean, you work out or...
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Twice a week.
Free weights.
- Okay.
All right.
- You got a nice, thick head of hair.
- Protein shampoo.
- She's gonna like that.
- Yeah.
- Look after your scalp.
- Right.
All we got to do is find a way to get you two together, you know?
At her apartment, you show up as the cable guy or innocent pizza boy or...
- You watch a lot of porn, don't you?
- No.
I was inclined to regard this injury as the result of attempts by plunderers to hastily remove the wrappings from the mummy.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go over there when she's finished, and strike up a conversation with her.
- Yeah.
- I know.
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just thinking, in the smock, better not.
- Yes.
I came straight from work.
- Okay.
- I'm a dentist.
This is what we wear.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- This is how we do it, baby.
- Okay.
And remember that the show officially opens on Friday, the 12th.
Thank you, thank you very much for coming.
You know, it's an interesting story.
My daughter went to Egypt.
- Oh, really?
Did she?
- Oh, yeah.
Good, all right.
I owe you an apology.
Do you mean for stealing my cab or for not holding the elevator?
- Don't remember the second one.
- Oh, no, no.
I know.
Maybe it was for that time that you told the super that somebody down on nine was cooking stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes?
- Was that you?
- It was tacos.
They told me that any complaints would be kept anonymous.
Or, you know, maybe it was for the eight or ten times that I said,
"Hello," or "Good morning" or whatever, and you never even looked at me.
I'm a very private person.
What you are is a little bit of a jerk.
- Bertram Pincus, D.D.S.
- So I've read.
- I enjoyed your lecture very much.
- Thank you.
- Don't take the walk-outs personally.
- I hadn't noticed.
But, you know, thank you for that encouragement.
Quite a few, quite a few.
What do they know?
- Atrocious dental hygiene.
- I'm sorry?
Your mummy. 1999.1.4.
He was no flosser.
Dental humor.
Is there something else?
Shoes.
Your shoes are comfortable.
Bye.
I knew you were gonna come off scary.
I wasn't scary.
I caught her at a bad time.
- Right, and it scared her.
- I'm not scary!
Don't make eye contact.
Let me...
No, no, no.
Let me preface this.
- What the hell is your problem?
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
- No, no.
You got a big problem.
Big problem with women.
No, I take it back.
You got a problem with people.
- Yeah, they suck.
- Would you quit banging that drum?
What's the drama?
Some big, bad lady went and broke your heart?
Well, get over it.
It's in the past.
You know nothing about my past, do you?
I know you got to forget about this and let it go.
It's not helping you out there.
Listen, the thing with women is that they...
I do fine with women.
Thanks very much.
You know, for the sake of time, I'm gonna agree with that insane point, and say, "Yeah, you do great with women.
You do great."
But you stink with this one.
So we got work to do.
And she likes a man who's a man.
She likes you to order for her in a restaurant.
And don't get bossy!
Don't ever tell her to take it easy, Pincus.
- This will make her absolutely nuts.
- Yeah.
I do know how to talk to people.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you got a gift, don't you?
Yeah.
Once you're with her, you got to show her you care.
You got to be jealous, got to be suspicious.
Why on earth would I do that?
'Cause it shows you're interested.
This is the worst advice I've ever had in my life.
But she's jealous, too, and she's no dummy.
She thinks you're lying, she'll raise one eyebrow and cock her head.
I call it her pirate look.
Rattles the hell out of you.
- Hi.
- I'm gonna get the next one.
Don't be silly.
Get in here.
I don't want to...
Okay.
Pincus.
Okay, just don't say anything.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not ready.
You're not ready.
Just ride in silence, okay?
Don't do this.
And get that face off.
You're not...
Don't do it!
I've been thinking about your decaying jawbone.
Pitting is what I'm talking.
Saw it on the slideshow, which would indicate to me, a trained dentist, some bone loss, and on the upper left mandibular gum line.
The mummy.
Open invitation to a little vitis called "Gingi."
Gingivitis?
More dental humor.
This time bone-based, but essentially...
Check out the mandibular bone loss, if I...
But wouldn't that just be ordinary wear and tear?
Not if it's only on one side, you idiot.
I don't think so.
How do the ladies resist that rap of yours?
All right, all right.
Not a total disaster.
Next time, you just got to listen to what it is that I'm saying.
Excuse me?
Do you think maybe you could come by someday and maybe examine him?
Let's have a look, shall we?
- Okay.
- Okay.
No, today's out, tomorrow is out.
That.
Cannot move that.
Cannot move that.
That is set in stone.
And that little puppy is hunkered in good.
Hunkerty, dunkerty, dock.
I don't want to move that, but I can't do that, either.
Busy bee.
- It's okay.
- It seems to me, I think, commitments abound.
Pack 'em in, move 'em out, Rawhide.
No way is that gonna...
- For the love of God!
- 4:00 Thursday seems totally free, so...
- Great.
Okay.
- Good.
See you then.
Way to go, Frank.
Oh, God.
Oh, thank God you're back.
You left the newspaper on a cell phone ad, you sadist!
- I'm sorry.
- No, forget it.
I'm not in the mood anymore.
Where have you been?
I sit around here all day long, and you're out God knows where.
You meet interesting people.
You have a career.
Hey, is that a new shirt?
Hey, it is a new shirt, and it's got sleeves.
Well, well, well.
Pinky's got himself a brand new shirt for the big...
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah, it's my yacht, yeah.
Quite the little heartbreaker, huh?
You should have seen the state he was in when we found him.
Blackened skin, multiple fractures from extensive marauding, fully retreated lips.
Five thousand years of acid reflux will do that to you.
Deep down, you know, the preservation was exquisite New Kingdom work, and it's what's underneath that counts.
First, they suctioned his brain out through his nose.
And then they make a slit in the side of the abdomen, so that they can remove the stomach, liver, intestines...
Beautiful.
...so that they could be separately preserved in Canopic jars.
But what's really exciting about Pepi is how they handled his organ.
- His organ?
- Yeah, his dick.
I got it right here.
You wanna see it?
Please.
There's nothing unusual about the phallus itself.
- Sure.
- It's the way it was stored.
You know, normally, the penis and the heart are kept together and mummified along with the body, but in Pepi's case, they removed it and preserved it in this separate gold-encrusted jar.
God.
I can see why he was king.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
I've got to get used to looking down at a shriveled, old penis, eventually.
Oh, geez.
I see he died happy.
That's it.
That's enough.
He must have had huge hands.
- No, no.
- Yeah.
Is this here the pitting that you were referring to?
Yeah.
Here, here, and look, really bad there.
We just assumed that was post-mortal decay.
Don't be naive.
That is the work of an untreated abscess.
That was a absolute magic carpet of bacterial infection.
And that could have killed him?
Yeah, if it was severe, that would have led to something more systemic, and as soon as the infection hit the spinal column, he'd have pennies on his eyes in no time at all.
Well, the mouth.
A coin in the mouth.
It was a Greek tradition, you know, to pay the boatman to ferry you across the River Styx, but...
I mean, this is an amazing breakthrough, and just in time for our opening next Thursday.
- Hey, will you come?
- What?
- Big opening with loads of people...
- Yeah.
- No.
That's...
- You don't like crowds?
It's not so much the crowd as the individuals in the crowd I don't like.
Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.
Just seems so obvious now.
Why didn't I call a dentist sooner?
Everybody waits until it's too late.
So you're a funny dentist.
You wanna touch him?
- This is my lucky day.
- Yeah.
- No, no.
Really, really touch him.
Yeah.
- More, yeah.
- No, like...
- Down there.
- Isn't that amazing?
- Wow.
Brilliant.
Don't you just love that smell?
It's not decay.
It's the resin.
It's pine.
- They imported it from North Africa.
- Oh, good.
After a couple of hours, the smell that was initially so sweet, it triggers your vomit impulse.
Like visiting your grandmother.
Sugar-free treat?
Sure.
Okay.
It's sweetened with Splenda.
Surprisingly delightful.
- Have you lived in the building long?
- Four years and one month.
Originally born and raised in England, obviously, and then...
- Why'd you move?
- London.
Just too much.
Overcrowded, just no privacy.
Just too many people.
So you picked Manhattan?
The reasoning is a little bit convoluted.
It's difficult to explain.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
- Wife?
- No.
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.
Still together?
Possibly.
I haven't spoken to her for years.
No, she died, actually.
Quite sad.
She had a rare condition.
Have you heard of auto-cannibalism?
She actually ate herself.
I made that up.
I was joking.
- But that's not funny.
- Funnier than the truth.
- Okay, and the truth about Sarah is...
- Very boring and ordinary.
How long you been here?
Can you just hold on one second?
This is so stupid, but my keychain broke, and I can never find my keys.
I moved back to the city about a year ago, just after my husband died.
You lost your husband?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks.
I want to ask you something, and you tell me if it's inappropriate.
Okay.
Okay.
This tooth.
It kills whenever I drink anything cold.
I mean, it's just...
- Should I make an appointment?
- No, just warm the drinks up.
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Open wide.
You want me to say, "Ah"?
Hey, Dentist!
I need you to clip a guy for me.
- Can you tell what it is?
- It's bad molar contact.
You see, Dentist, in life,
I accepted payment for a job which I wasn't able to complete.
Bad molar contact?
I mean, is it really very serious?
- You should come and see me.
- Should I?
- You have to finish it for me.
- Yeah.
There's a.38 snub-nose taped under the seat of my mother's Cadillac.
You just give him two in the head.
Leave the gun on the floor.
- Maybe I will.
- Okay.
- What the...
- Is now a good time?
Is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's just the...
- 'Cause you look a little...
Oh, geez.
Oh, no, don't...
Careful.
Look, right in the ear nearly.
It's just...
I saw you talking to Irish Eddie and I figured, you know...
Hi, there.
Hey!
Good.
Another one.
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hey!
I didn't see you.
- Hi.
- Oh, alive.
Why did this fellow have his hands in your mouth?
Sorry, Dr. Pincus, this is Richard, my fiancé.
Richard, this is Dr. Pincus, that dentist that I told you about in the building.
I think he's got a really terrific idea about what might have killed Pepi.
Really?
That's fantastic.
You know, I've been needing to find a dentist, myself.
Why don't you join us for dinner tomorrow night, Doctor?
At Gwen's.
I'm making curry.
- She's really cute.
- Don't...
- Doctor?
- Yes, love to.
- Great.
- I'm in 9F, right below you.
Thank you.
- I hope it was edible.
- Best curry I've ever tasted.
- Stop complimenting him!
- You're too kind.
- Where did you learn to cook?
- Idiot Boy, you're making him look good.
I had a friend who was generous with her time.
Richard's being modest.
He worked for three years with homeless prostitutes in Bengal.
You still in the sex trade or...
That's inappropriate.
You know, Doctor,
I confess an ulterior motive in asking you here tonight.
As a dentist, you could do an awful lot of good in the developing world.
They're in desperate need of modern dental care.
"Modern dental care." You believe this guy?
Now, the political will is there, the money's there.
What an act.
So pompous!
- Sorry.
What is that?
- My new puppy.
NGOs are being supported.
Record levels.
- I need you to punch him.
- But what we really need...
- Come on!
...are boots on the ground.
Kick his self-righteous teeth in!
How can teeth be self-righteous?
Is a strange thing for a dentist to burst out with over curry, but, you know, it needs to be...
I mean, I know the answer.
Well, I'll tell you, they can't.
What is essentially dentin and enamel outcrops from various mandibles are inanimate, and therefore, have no moral code.
All they can do is chew and grind, and that's passive.
It's mainly the cheek muscles do that, from...
What were you saying?
I was...
I was...
I was saying, we need...
We need people like you who can bring their expertise to bear in places like Peru, Cambodia, sub-Saharan Africa.
Mainly those sort of really hot, sticky places.
I mean, I'm just not a humidy person.
I mean, what is the dental care like in, say, I don't know, Palm Springs?
There's breezes.
You know, what are the teeth like in Saint-Tropez?
I mean, I could do veneers.
Oh, they love to smile, the French.
Shrugging and smiling.
He's kidding, sweetie.
I'm sorry, I have to take this.
Boy, he'd be handy on a camping trip, huh?
Do you want some more wine?
- That tent pole stuck up his ass.
- Please.
Okay.
Well, that is perfectly unacceptable.
- Shut...
- What?
What?
Am I throwing you off your game?
If I am, just give me a fake cough and I'll...
Okay, was that...
Was that a coincidence?
Okay, okay!
I'm gone.
Richard's a human rights lawyer, so, well, he takes his job very seriously.
Oh, well, so you should with human rights.
I take human rights seriously.
You know, everybody's equal, color, creed or circumstance.
We're all the same on this planet.
- Except the Chinese.
- What?
No, they are.
They're the odd ones out if you had to pick one.
No, I'm not having a go.
I'm just saying, you know, not their faces.
I mean...
No, no.
But they call each other
- things like Kwok...
- Stop it.
You're gonna and that's their choice, and they don't have to call a kid Kwok.
And they...
No.
Some people are called Pong...
- Stop, please, stop.
...and there's about a million Wangs.
You can have...
You have one kid, you can use all those names on one little...
You could call a kid Kwok Pong Wang.
Ming Wa Men and Ho Lee Park have been arrested in Shaolin.
I have to get down to the office.
Well, they're being arraigned in 30 minutes
- and the government will only allow...
- Not again.
...their attorneys to appear by closed-circuit.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm afraid I have to go.
Doctor, it's been a...
Yeah, so you guys stay and have fun and finish up.
Oh, gosh, poor Leonard.
Do you mind if I let him out?
- No, not at all.
- Okay, be right back.
When did you get your horse?
A couple of months ago.
I found him at this shelter in Long Island.
They were gonna put him down.
Then they lost their nerve, did they?
The smell?
Yeah, I know.
His mood levelers give him this ulcerating skin rash.
Are you okay?
Got a very sensitive gag reflex.
Oh, dear.
And the mixture of that and that.
- Are you all right?
Do you want to...
- Sorry.
You know what?
I think he needs to go out.
Do you want to maybe walk him now or we could finish up and...
Now is good, yeah.
Get some air with some oxygen in it.
Leonard, you good boy!
That is so healthy!
Good, good boy!
That's a good boy!
That's a good boy!
You wanna finish dinner?
I don't think I'm quite ready for solid foods just yet.
- I'll have a drink, though.
- Sure.
There's...
Bemelmans is just around the corner.
Or, no, have you ever been to that new...
I know, yeah.
No, I like Sting because you can hear he's educated in his lyrics.
- Pimm's Cup for the lady.
- Thank you.
And a Sapphire martini up with olives.
Thank you.
You know, that was Frank's favorite drink.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Sorry.
You forgot?
You forgot what?
Forgot?
Yeah.
You recently lost your husband, and the polite thing to do in this situation would have been to check what the deceased's drink was as not to evoke any horrible memories.
Why would you assume that they were horrible?
Painful.
Not necessarily horrible.
Just all the memories, nonetheless, of drink-related death memory.
I like a Pimm's Cup.
This is exactly the kind of girly drink that Frank would have teased me about.
Once when we were in Anguilla, I ordered a Screaming Orgasm.
And then...
So Frank goes up to the waiter, and he grabs him by the lapels and he goes,
"Hey, I'm the only one giving..."
Oh, for God's sake!
Sorry.
Just running on about my dead husband.
No, no, no, it wasn't you.
No, no.
I've just seen someone I hate.
It's...
Oh, that's sweet.
They never get over Frankie.
- Someone I really hate.
- Well, do you wanna leave?
No, no, no.
He should leave.
Let's do some...
You were saying that Frank had his flaws.
- I was?
- Yeah, and that's really healthy because you should not romanticize the dead.
You should remember their faults.
Oh, well, I remember them.
Oh, good.
Well, let's make a list.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
This is therapeutic, actually.
You can trust me.
I'm a dentist.
- Come on, then.
- Okay.
His faults.
Number one.
Well, Frank could be a little controlling.
Well, that's what made me successful.
But that's probably why he was so good at his job, so...
No, no, don't apologize for him.
If he was obnoxious, say so.
Okay, he was occasionally obnoxious.
Regularly, I imagine.
- No, no, no, you walked her into that.
- "Obnoxious."
That didn't count, Pincus.
Hey, what are you doing, Marjorie?
You rubbernecking?
Oh, be quiet!
Let them talk.
You could learn something.
He had a shoe fetish.
That is so embarrassing, because it starts on shoes, and go to gloves and hats and socks, up the...
Right. "Pervert."
And he was rude to waiters.
And I hate that.
- So do I.
- You mind?
Because they're just doing a job, aren't they?
What a nasty piece of work.
So what about his physical characteristics?
I'll bet he was really into fitness, because he was a scrawny little runt, was he?
No, but, you know, he was actually starting to get into yoga at the end there.
- I'll bet he was.
- But he spent a lot of time at the gym.
Yeah.
Okay, this is shaping up nicely.
So now we've got a narcissistic, obnoxious pervert who's rude to waiters.
It's a good list.
I don't have to listen to this shit.
Disloyal.
Yeah, I think that's enough.
I didn't know you knew.
I didn't find out until the day he died.
Can you imagine?
I didn't get the chance to say, "Hey, go to hell,"
you know, "I want a divorce," like a normal person.
Well, I'm sorry.
I...
- That must feel...
- Unfinished.
She used to travel a lot for her work, Sarah.
And the trips got longer and longer.
And then one trip, she didn't come back at all.
Married a man in Portland.
Sorry.
Travel will do that to a relationship.
Yep.
I just got this amazing offer to go map tombs in the Valley of the Kings for six months.
But I think I'm gonna say no this time.
Because of Richard.
Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Your story, it's not boring and ordinary, by the way.
I mean, we just get the one life, you know?
Just one.
You can't live someone else's or think it's more important, just because it's more dramatic.
What happens matters.
Maybe only to us, but it matters.
Good night.
Good night.
What?
What's with the doom and gloom?
It's going good.
You're weaseling your way right in there.
This is gonna work.
This Richard fellow, I just...
I think Gwen really loves him.
You know he's a human rights lawyer.
Hey, when the devil shows up, you think he's gonna have little red horns and carry a pitchfork?
No, he's gonna work for Amnesty International, and he's gonna give all of his money to the homeless.
Well, if he did all that, wouldn't he lose the title "the devil"?
You know what I mean.
Pincus, I got better things to do with my time.
I wouldn't just be hanging out here.
What, exactly, is your problem with Richard?
I told you!
The guy is setting her up to rob her blind.
And what proof have you got?
I don't...
What are you basing this on?
I saw things with my own two eyes.
- Saw what?
- Just enough to know.
Come on.
What did he do?
Well, that's...
He's...
Okay, all right, fine.
They're out at a restaurant, okay?
- Yeah.
- And they're eating.
- Yeah.
- And the check came, and this clown says that his wallet is in his coat.
It's over at the coat check.
- How convenient, right?
- Right.
So he goes over to go get it, makes a big show about the whole thing, too, and she says, "No, no, let me get this."
- Yeah?
- And he accepted.
There's nothing wrong with him, is there?
No, no, don't you see?
He showed his true colors.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, he's a perfectly lovely human being.
Pincus, there are other things!
- He took five grand from her.
- He what?
Yeah. $5,000.
I saw her write the check with my own two eyes, put it right in his sweaty little fist.
It was...
For charity.
He was fundraising, wasn't he?
Or shaking the money tree, see what drops.
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What was it, AIDS?
- No.
Refugees?
Orphans?
Orphans.
Good.
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.
- You really are.
This guy, he's a lawyer.
- Yeah.
A lawyer who fights to protect the rights of the underprivileged.
Come on!
There must be something wrong with him.
There must be some reason why all this is happening.
Otherwise, what am I doing here?
I'm out.
What?
No, no.
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm not gonna interfere with Gwen's life anymore.
And I can't lie to her.
You were right about the pirate look.
She threw that at me, and I nearly confessed to everything there and then.
You can't abandon her to this creep.
- She loves him.
- She doesn't love him!
I haven't seen her laugh once with this guy!
He's a good man.
You actually like him, with his whole Mother Teresa schtick?
I hate him.
Okay?
I want to run him over with his own little stupid, electric car.
But he's what Gwen wants.
And after what she's been through with you, she deserves a bit of happiness.
You're in love with her.
You are.
I knew it.
That little Grinch heart of yours actually started beating, and now you want to take it back to your cave and crush it with a rock.
That's what you wanna do.
- I quit.
- You can't quit.
I'll make your life a living hell.
It already is.
There you go.
That's such a good boy.
Such a good boy.
Leonard, Leonard, open, open.
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
Leonard, Leonard, Leonard.
Don't be a jerk.
Come on.
God damn it.
Come on.
Come on.
You don't wanna wait until it's too late, do you, sweetie?
Wait.
Leonard!
It is too late.
Too late.
And so Alex says to me,
"Mommy, I know that babies come from inside a lady's tummy,
"but what I really want to know is, how do they get there?"
Can you believe?
And, of course,
- I have no clue what to say...
- Head back.
...but I have to come up with something, because his father...
Oh, no talking, not when we're popping this in.
- Okay.
- Bite down there.
There you go.
Good.
Just leave that there.
Isn't that good?
So much better.
You're resting your jaw, and I'm resting my ears and we're all winners.
Can you get these over to the lab?
A little rush job.
Mr. Harriman's bridge is on the verge of...
I thought I was through for the day after this.
- You are through.
- What about the...
What about what?
- Frank.
- Who?
I don't know who you mean.
What are you...
Who?
I've never...
Okay, my opinion is that you didn't make sense just now.
Well, I don't know who you're talking about.
Can I have the bathroom key, please?
I'm having a bit of a...
- No, no, he'll run.
- That's him!
- Dentist, don't piss me off!
- Thank you.
He's not in the office!
Well, then he must be upstairs.
Good afternoon, Doctor.
Good to see you.
You look smart.
Just been to the toilet.
Different route back, around the...
I mean, I finished earlier than I thought, so I just took my time.
I mean, you can take a long time next time if you...
Good.
Okay.
That's set.
Okay, it has to be...
Good.
Can you take a new walk-in before you leave, Dr. Pincus?
He seems to be in a lot of pain.
Life is pain.
Does that mean yes?
So we have an emergency on our hands.
I'm Dr. Pincus.
- Yes, we've met.
- Oh, hi.
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yep.
What seems to be the problem?
I don't know.
I think I must have cracked a filling.
That was silly.
Head back.
Let's have a look, shall we?
Open up.
Oh, yeah, there it is.
Well, you've got the bite of an Inuit.
Have you been chewing seal hide?
Yeah, well, I tend to grind my teeth pretty hard when I'm stressed and I'm...
I don't know.
Last night was a tough one.
- I came home and Gwen was...
- What?
- Gwen was...
- Oh, no, never mind.
No, you were gonna say something about...
Well, she was just...
- No, forget about it.
- No, I can't forget about it.
- Just...
- Well, it's nothing.
- Can we just get this...
- Well, it is something or you wouldn't have brought it up.
And, you know...
- It's personal.
- I know that, but, I mean just to...
I'd rather not talk about it.
- Why don't we just...
- "Finish what you started" is my motto.
- I'm a good listener.
Please.
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Can we just...
- Well, can you wait a minute then?
- I'm in pain.
- Please.
Dr. Prashar?
Jahangir?
That's his first name.
You're from a scary country, aren't you?
Excuse me.
- I'm from India.
- Yeah.
So you're not a Christian, like us.
No, I'm a Hindu.
How would you extract information from a hostile?
Well, as a Hindu person,
I would ask them politely.
Yeah, I just need a technique.
- Doctor, I'm with a patient.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So where were we?
You were telling me about Gwen.
Something...
- No, I wasn't.
I meant my tooth, yeah.
- Tooth.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do this professionally.
All work and no play makes Jack a valuable member of society.
Open up.
- That hurts.
- Did it?
Well, take your word for that.
But it almost certainly would in this situation.
Do you know the worst thing in the world for teeth?
- Sugar?
- Secrets.
If you tell me what's on your mind, you will feel better.
As I said before, Doctor, it's private.
I really would like to keep this on a professional footing.
Yes, please.
We can play it any way you want to.
Actually.
That's not Novocain.
No, it is a little dab of nitrous oxide.
Nitrous?
I didn't know you guys still used nitrous.
- Are there any side effects?
- A few.
Some people laugh.
Some people get sleepy.
But they all talk.
Hey, Frankie!
Fancy seeing you here.
You back on the job yet or you need me to send more?
I got a couple Civil War re-enactors that'll talk your ear off.
- They used live ammo.
- Didn't get the news.
Job's done.
Richard's history.
- What?
- She dumped him last night.
- How do you know?
- He told me.
The marriage is off.
So he's out completely?
Well, he wants to stay friends, but she's done with him.
She said she was confused about her feelings and it wasn't right to string him along, so...
Why would Richard tell you all this?
Because I gave him 700 milliliters of nitrous oxide.
- Is that a lot?
- No.
It's not fatal till 750.
You know, I think this sounds a lot like a premarital spat.
- I mean, young couples at this stage...
- No.
Definitely not.
- Very normal for them to start...
- No, no, no.
...to get into this...
- She's taken the job in Egypt.
She's going there for six months.
It's the real thing.
She leaves Thursday, right after the exhibition opens.
- Well, this is great news.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we should maybe go celebrate, I guess.
- I can't.
- Me, neither.
- Well, wait!
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.
Is that from a jewelry store?
- Oh, my gosh.
Is that for Gwen?
- It doesn't matter.
Well, whatever happened to the "I will not interfere" thing?
There's nothing to interfere with now, is there?
The relationship's over!
She doesn't love him.
And you think she's gonna love you?
A smock-wearing tooth jockey?
I mean, I'm sorry.
You said that if I broke up the marriage, you'd leave me alone!
I broke up the marriage!
Leave me alone!
Well, you should at least let me help you pick out something!
Do you have any idea how much "Please forgive me" jewelry
- I bought her over the years?
- I can take it from here!
She loves Peruvian gold, but, Pincus,
- you're rushing things, I'm telling you!
- Frank!
Listen!
Our time together, as we both know, has been rather unpleasant.
But I will say this.
Even though you're a vulgar man, boorish, distasteful, uncouth, uneducated, stupid, at least...
- You gonna finish?
- Done.
- Okay.
- The point is this, we finished what you had to finish.
And who knows?
One day, not too soon I hope, we meet up again.
- Until then, this is our fond farewell.
- Yeah, but...
But why am I still here?
Construction crane dropped two tons of steel on us.
That must have hurt.
It was a hydraulic leak.
An act of God!
Why does he do those things?
But the crane operator, he thinks it's all his fault.
Oh, therapy time!
Don't panic.
It's nothing.
A key chain.
I needed a key chain!
- I love it!
- Oh, good.
I can't believe you remembered.
That is just...
What a strange and practical man you are.
It was down to that or a set of socket wrenches.
Well, I hope you didn't spend too much.
$140.
The receipt's in the box.
No, well, you don't actually have to tell people in that situation.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying it was no big deal.
It's not like it's Peruvian gold or anything.
And the reason I say that is because there was a set of earrings made from Peruvian gold in the shop, and I thought, "Gwen would like those,
"but sorry, a little bit out of my price range."
So...
What?
Stop giving me the pirate look.
I just got you a gift and, you know, nothing ostentatious or pushy.
Just a little gesture to let you know I've been thinking about you, and I think you should accept it in the spirit of friendship with which it was given.
"Pirate look"?
How could you possibly know about that?
- I don't.
- You do.
- Common expression?
- No.
How do you know about any of this stuff?
- Pirate look?
Peruvian gold?
- Everyone knows about Peruvian gold.
And then the other night, Frank's favorite drink?
Come on, take it easy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.
- You hate that.
How do you know what I hate?
Lucky guess.
Can we start again?
Why don't you just tell her?
Come on, spill it.
She's leaving anyway in a few days.
Gonna have to go with the truth, Dentist, no choice.
You've got about 10 seconds to start talking, buddy, and then I'm out of here.
How do you know this stuff from my life with Frank?
- It'll sound crazy.
- Try her.
Try me.
A couple of weeks ago, I went into hospital for a routine operation, but there was complications.
And I died.
Just for a few minutes...
It's true!
I can prove it!
He's here, right now, with us.
You know what?
Just stop.
What you're doing, it's cruel.
How else would I know all the things I know?
Well, you must have known Frank.
I don't know, maybe you were his dentist.
Ask me something else, then.
Something that I couldn't possibly know.
- How do you get like you?
- Please.
One question, and if I get it wrong, you'll never see me again.
Frank used to have this nightmare over and over.
He'd wake up in tears and he never told anybody else about it, but me.
What was it?
Drowning.
I'd dream that I dove into the water, and I went down deep, but when I turned around to make it back to the top,
I couldn't, no matter how hard I swam.
Drowning.
He dived into the water, and it didn't matter how hard he tried to get back to the surface, he couldn't.
That's right, isn't it?
Not even close.
No!
You know the first time I met you?
And then the next 10 or 12 times after that, I thought, "What a jerk."
But then I got to know you a little bit, right?
And I convinced myself that I saw something human in you.
You know, "Maybe he's just a little eccentric,
"needs a little work."
But to use intimate details about my dead husband in order to get close to me, or for God knows what other reason, that's unforgivable.
You're sick.
- I love you.
- Don't call me!
You lied.
Why would you do that?
Because you're a heartless son of a bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself.
She's already had one of those.
See you around, Dentist.
- What?
- It's my daughter.
Yeah, you mentioned something about that.
She won't speak to her sister, her only sister.
She's so angry about the necklace I left, but I slipped a letter under her door the day before I died.
It explained everything.
But there was carpeting in the entryway.
I didn't know the letter went under the carpet.
She never got it.
My God, you're boring, aren't you?
My little boy has a stuffed animal, a squirrel.
It was his favorite.
He took it everywhere.
Couldn't get to sleep without it.
But he lost it on the day I died.
They don't know it's just under the front seat of the car.
It's right there, they just can't see it.
So now, he cries himself to sleep without it every night, because to him that toy is me.
I can't help you.
You mean you won't help us.
Isn't that the truth?
Yeah, I'll tell you what else is true, shall I?
We live alone and then we die alone.
And, apparently, we stay alone.
That's the truth, too, isn't it?
- You idiot!
- I'm sorry!
Unbelievable!
Come on.
- Hello.
- What a day.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
- Hail.
- What?
It doesn't even have the decency to snow.
Is there any more stupid form of precipitation than hail?
- No, I suppose that is the stupidest.
- Jahangir?
- Yeah.
- We're friends.
- Well...
- Associates.
- Yeah.
- We have things in common.
- Yeah.
- We share stuff and...
Panoramic X-ray machine, for example.
- Yeah.
- We're close.
- No, I wouldn't say that.
- Not close, but...
What the...
Well, that's not the point, is it?
Listen.
I met a woman.
The kind of a woman that makes you want to go back in time to before you met her.
Whatever the hell life was like then, it's not as bad as the hell now.
Knowing she's out there and you can't have her.
What I'm trying to say is could you write me a prescription for Percocet?
What?
Well, I can't prescribe myself, can I?
Legally.
It's for my sleep and to pretend she never happened.
Or Darvon.
Or Vicodin.
Just like a 30 count, or 60, if you don't want me to keep bothering you.
And I'll be out of your hair.
I'm not even gonna ask for morphine.
Come with me.
- What are we doing?
- Just sit down.
- No.
- Sit down.
- Why?
- Just sit down.
- Oh, look, never mind.
- This is important.
Look.
- Brilliant.
- The other one.
Yep.
As mass-produced poster slogans go, that's good.
Dr. Pincus, at some point in your life, you're gonna have to stop, and ask yourself the ultimate question.
"This business of
"being such a fucking prick,
"what is it really getting me?"
You said something about a letter.
You should try it on.
Mom!
Look what I found!
What?
Where'd you find this?
Where did it come from?
It fell out of his backpack.
Thank you.
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
Sorry, I didn't...
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
I never realized.
Thanks.
...many insights into the life and death of King Pepi.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Gwen!
What are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.
I've figured it out.
Please leave me alone.
It's all rubbish.
What they tell us in ghost stories,
I think they've got it completely wrong.
Ghost stories.
Could you not do this here tonight?
Look at Pepi.
Okay, they buried him with everything a dead guy doesn't need.
Household pets, money.
They even put his penis in a big jar.
Why would they do that?
But you saw that penis.
It wouldn't have fit in a little jar.
No, not why did they put it in a big...
Why'd they put it in a jar at all?
Why?
What?
Why would they go to all that trouble for someone they'll never see again?
Because they love him and they want to make sure he'll be okay.
Because if they know he's okay...
- Yes, they can let him go.
- You were fabulous.
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
Appreciate it.
Exactly.
They can let him go.
Frank's haunting you, Gwen.
Let him go.
If he's haunting me, then shouldn't he let me go?
No.
He can't.
It's not him.
It's you.
All this stuff about ghosts having unfinished business, it's us that are unfinished.
Let Frank go.
Let the pervert decay in peace.
Please, stop following me.
- It was wonderful!
Thank you so much.
- Yes, it's nice to see you both.
That came out all wrong.
I don't care how you knew all that stuff about Frank, okay?
- I don't care.
- I told you, I'm trying to...
Maybe you guys were a couple of buddies.
- How about that?
- No, no, no, no, no...
Two regular guys while he was alive, and you went out drinking and went to strip clubs
- and talked about your girlfriends...
- Oh, my God.
...and laughed at your wives...
- I swear.
- What was the matter with me?
Why didn't he love me?
I did love you.
I still do.
He did love you.
Then why wasn't I enough?
You've got nothing to say to that, have you?
- What?
- Useless.
Please.
What do you think I'm gonna do, change?
- Well...
- In all your life, have you ever actually known anybody who's changed at all, ever?
Why can't you make an effort, just for a few seconds?
I am who I am.
I suppose you're talking to him right now?
- Is that what you want me to believe?
- What do you want to tell him?
- What do you want to say?
- I want an answer!
I want to know why I wasn't enough for him.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
It wasn't you that wasn't enough.
I don't know why I did the shit that I did.
And he doesn't know why he did the things he did.
And you don't get any smarter just because you're dead.
You don't get smarter after you die.
But I did see one thing, how much I hurt you.
But he's seen how much he hurt you.
And...
I'm so sorry, honey.
- What?
What'd he say?
- He said he's sorry.
That's it?
He's sorry?
Well, it was the way he said it, it was...
He's sorry.
He's sorry.
- Heartfelt.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Heartfelt.
Good guess.
I got to go pack.
No, you should have heard it!
I'm really not doing it justice!
Gwen!
Wait!
Why should I talk to you?
You couldn't even get his dream right!
No, because he told me the wrong dream to try to make me look bad.
He stitched me up.
Then what's the right one?
Well, he's not here right now, is he?
- I can't check with him.
- Oh, that's convenient.
No, it's not convenient.
It's really inconvenient.
Listen, I'm not a liar, okay?
I've been a lot of things.
I've been cold, selfish, self-centered.
I'm not a liar and I'm not lying now.
Gwen, I've lived more in the last few days that I've spent with you, since I died, than I ever lived before I died, back when I was living, the first time.
Right?
Do you know what I mean?
Nope.
Right.
I'm born and then...
Someone call an ambulance!
Try to get help!
Somebody do something!
Oh, my God.
Now that is a real shame.
You were really getting somewhere with her, too.
- What's happening?
- You ate it, pal.
Goddamned MTA strikes again.
These drivers, I mean, it's a menace, right?
No!
No, I'm not dead!
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, kiddo.
Come here, you.
Kind of nice.
- Feels good.
- I was just getting started!
Everything else, every minute up till now has just been a waste of time!
Just a warm-up!
Yeah.
- This is the worst part.
- Somebody do...
- Watching her cry.
- Do something!
Knowing she needs somebody to comfort her and knowing it can't be you.
Has anyone called 911?
- Wait a minute.
- You got to be kidding me.
Well, call them!
- Wait a minute.
- Space!
Give me space!
He's doing CPR.
He knows CPR.
Of course!
He knows CPR.
Give him space, he needs space.
He's probably gonna cut open your chest and massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Oh, Lord!
Spare this man!
Okay, I really can't take this guy anymore.
Honestly, really, I can't.
Come on!
Hey, Pincus, there's something I should tell you.
It might come in handy if you make it back.
You're gonna help me?
Why?
Those tears she's crying, those are for you, now.
Listen up.
I think my ride's here.
Dr. Pincus, always good to see you.
What happened?
You crossed the street when it said, "Don't walk."
Not much of a lawsuit, I'm afraid.
Gwen.
Was there a woman here?
It's possible, but if she was unable to provide proof of kinship, security would have escorted her off the premises.
Nice work, guys.
- You went darker.
- I went darker, yes.
Looks good.
Makes your eyes pop.
Okay, Mr. Goldman, six months.
Remember, only floss the ones you wanna keep.
Hi.
I didn't know you were back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you were in Egypt.
I felt like sticking around.
You're okay?
Yeah.
Under the circumstances.
You know, I tried visiting you at the hospital, but they wouldn't...
Yeah, they run a tight ship over there at Cooperative Institutional Health Bastards.
You okay?
I have bad molar contact.
Sit down.
I was wondering if you had that seen to.
I'm not.
I actually made the appointment with Dr. Prashar.
- Oh, no, of course.
No...
He's...
- Well, I didn't know...
He's a lovely man.
And he's a better dentist than me, but don't tell him I said so.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you're looking well.
And you.
He's eight years old.
- Sorry?
What?
- Frank.
In his dream.
The real one.
And he's walking in the woods with his dad.
He's holding hands, but then suddenly, his dad's not there.
He tries to find his way back the way he came, but he keeps ending up back where he started, and that's his nightmare.
That he's lost and he can't find his way home.
That's it.
Do you still see him?
He found his way home.
That's good.
It hurts when I smile.
I can fix that for you.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Hey, honey, what's up?
Slow down.
Who are you talking about?
No, I don't know!
Sweetheart, I don't have a clue what you're...
An apartment?
No, no!
Of course I'm not looking at an apartment!
Why would I be looking at an apartment?
Wait a sec, wait.
I know what this is.
Oldest trick in the book.
Yeah.
Did a realtor call you?
Yeah.
Yeah, realtor calls the wife, says, "Oh, yeah, I spoke to the husband.
"I'm looking at a..."
My card?
My business card?
I don't know.
That I don't know.
I don't know why he has my business card.
Maybe he...
Maybe he or she, then.
Yeah.
Okay, surprise ruined.
No, no, it's all right.
It was gonna be for our anniversary, but I...
Yeah, it's just a little one-bedroom in the West Village, but you're gonna love it.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, listen, the car never picked me up for this thing at the Waldorf.
I got to go.
I'll see you at home tonight, okay, honey?
I love you, too.
It's okay.
Big kiss.
All right, then.
Bye-bye.
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You a real estate broker or a professional fucking idiot?
Babe, I really think we ought to let the super do that.
No, I got it, I got it.
Just move that stuff.
No, I did not say my wife needs to see the apartment.
I said Amber needs to see the apartment.
Amber.
Amber sound like the wife of a man my age to you?
- Careful with my table!
- Yeah, picked it up right now.
Okay, just get the cord for me, will you?
Okay, all right.
I got it, baby.
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it out of my way.
Well, it's not exactly a love nest if my wife's there picking out the goddamned curtains, is it?
Careful, just get the window, get the window.
- Okay?
- Ready?
Yeah, just pull it down, and inside.
No, I'm telling you right now, stop talking.
Because I'm thinking.
No, I'm thinking!
I don't...
You know what?
Just kill it.
No, kill it.
Kill the whole thing.
- There, good.
- See?
DIY. "Do It Yourself."
Oh, no!
Call me over the weekend.
Leave a message on the home machine saying the seller's had a change of heart, and that the whole thing's...
- Oh, my God!
...dead.
You are not gonna believe what almost just happened!
- Did you see that?
- Someone call 911!
- Oh, my God, is he dead?
- He ain't happy.
What?
You cannot be serious!
Not now.
Okay, go ahead and spit.
So, anyway, the very first scene just takes your breath away.
You have to remind yourself that you're in the theater watching a play.
My five-year-old, Alex, just adored it.
He wanted his father to see it with us.
That's better.
Anyway, I think he really, really enjoyed the costumes...
Dr. Pincus?
Hi.
I'm gonna need the panoramic X-ray machine for most of the morning tomorrow, so if that fits in with your appointments...
Fine.
I've cleared my schedule for tomorrow.
Really?
I hear it's supposed to be a lovely day.
And?
No, I just thought that maybe you were taking the day off to go and...
Right.
Sorry to bother you.
You know, we brought some cake.
Mrs. Prashar and I just had our baby, so...
Yeah, it's a girl, and we're having a little cake and I brought some pictures, so, if you...
That'd be delightful.
Start without me.
Great, great.
Okay, so...
What a cute baby.
She is so cute.
- Yeah, she really is.
- How long was the labor?
- Ten hours.
- Ten hours?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
- That seems like a really long time.
- No, not really.
- It's not?
- Not really.
- See, that's, like, too long.
- It's so worth it.
I'll just get a cat, you know?
Like, 10 hours is a long time to get something, you know?
- Look at that.
- So cute.
Stop global warming?
Yeah, just a tiny...
It might take a little jiggle.
Good evening, Doctor.
You know what?
Let me just open it.
Hey!
Can you hold the elevator?
Please?
- Yeah.
Holding.
- Thank you.
- Sorry!
- Wait, hold.
Hey!
Hey!
Good.
Still some more.
Come on, come on, come on, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it, make it.
Paging Dr. Michael, Dr. Michael to Pediatrics, please.
- Charts come back up, yet?
- They're there.
I appreciate it.
- Spell it.
- P-I-N-C-U-S.
- Date of birth?
- Why?
What day were you born?
No, I understood the question.
Why do you need to know that?
Let's leave it blank.
Weight?
- Last night or this morning?
- You pick.
Hundred and eighty-two pounds.
Number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week?
- Why do you need to know that?
- Well, they want to know.
Well, I'm sure "they" want to know a lot of things, but I don't want my intimate details auctioned off to the highest bidder, willy-nilly.
I'll put zero.
- Marital status?
- Pass.
- Profession?
- Irrelevant.
- Food allergies?
- I'm not gonna be eating here.
- Are you allergic to sticking plaster?
- What a ludicrous question.
I'm not answering any more of these, really.
- Do you smoke?
- Stop it.
- Do you wear dentures?
- Madame, listen.
- When was the last time you ate?
- A pertinent question at last.
Yesterday, lunchtime.
Thanks for asking.
I had a tuna sandwich.
Toast was soggy, but...
- Did you drink the laxative solution?
- Yes.
Did it work?
It was as advertised.
Did you evacuate your bowels?
I drank copious amounts of drain-cleaning fluid.
What followed was fait accompli.
Sir, what I'm asking is if you were...
I shat.
Okay?
Good.
Again and again.
It was like a terrorist attack down there in the darkness and the chaos, the running and the screaming, okay?
- Fine with me.
- Good.
Gross invasion of my privacy, this.
Wait till they get you in the back.
- Good morning, Dr. Pincus.
- Hi.
Don't anticipate any difficulties today.
We'll have you up and on your feet in no time.
- Okay.
- Quick question.
I notice you requested a general anesthetic.
It's not really typical for this type of procedure.
- It's not necessary and we normally...
- Sorry.
I have no intention of being around when they go where they're going.
When does the surgeon arrive?
I'm the surgeon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Why do you look that tan?
- Thanks for noticing.
I got a spray tan on my way to work today.
- Looks natural.
- Yes.
It's better for you.
It's moisturizing and it doesn't cause UV damage, so...
Yeah.
It has an odd smell.
I can't quite place it.
- I don't know if...
- No, I don't want to smell your fake tan!
- What are you...
- It's like dirt.
But like a garden dirt, like a good dirt.
Not like a garbage dirt.
- You gonna go darker?
- I think I am.
I think I'd like to go darker.
It's really gonna make my eyes pop.
You could get your teeth whitened like I did.
- Yeah, that makes a difference.
- Very nice.
Yeah, I don't like having trays in my mouth and my teeth are small.
Sorry, you babbling idiots.
Can we talk about my bowels?
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
Looks like the sodium thiopental's really kicking in, huh?
- Makes people say crazy things.
- I haven't given it to him yet.
- Going in now.
- How old are you?
So are you here on a school field trip?
Not a real people person are you, Dr. Pincus?
Not really.
Given a choice between a few people and loads of people,
I choose my cat.
She hunts dwarves.
She takes them up the tree.
They're still alive.
You can see their little legs going.
Sounds like Norah Jones when she plays the piano.
Wow, you must be excited to get home and see your cat.
What cat?
I thought yesterday you said you had a cat.
I despise cats.
What sort of men waste their affection on a cat?
Pathetic.
I had a cat once, when I was a little girl.
My father, right before he died, he took me to the shelter and he said,
"Debra, take a look at all these lonely cats..."
What a wonderful man he must have been.
Now, listen.
All those people in my room last night,
I thought I was dreaming at first, but I wasn't.
Who were they?
- I don't know anything about that.
- Right.
- Here you go.
Clean bill of health.
- All right, thank you.
Come back soon!
What a terrible thing to say in a hospital.
Nice.
Fine example for healthcare workers.
Still, I suppose smoking serves a purpose.
- Thins the herd.
Weeds out the stupid.
- Are you speaking to me?
Yeah, but I was having a go at them, not you.
Oh, good.
I picked one that should be in a straightjacket.
My mistake.
Show it some attention, it follows you home.
Unbelievable.
Sorry!
Did he see you, too?
- He can see us!
- Who?
That guy?
Hey, why don't you open your eyes?
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please, just hold up!
- Idiot.
Get out of the road.
- Wait!
Hey!
- Listen, I just need two minutes...
- Look out!
...of your time!
You can see me, huh?
And you're not like us.
I know you're not, because back there, that cab almost hit you!
And he honked at you, and he yelled at you!
I don't feel well.
Why on earth...
Hey!
Officer, there's loony weirdoes.
I don't know why they're here.
I'm a dentist.
- Hey, man, you can see me.
- Oh, good.
Hey, come back here!
I wanna talk to you!
Hey, don't be scared!
I'm a cop!
- He can see us?
- Who?
That guy?
...from the moment I left the hospital.
- What kind of side effects?
- Hallucinations.
- Okay, visual or aural?
- Both.
And really vivid, really realistic, weird.
I mean, that's not normal.
Well, you know.
What's normal, you know?
Really.
Not having hallucinations, I'd have thought.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Did any...
- Did any what...
- Sorry, but did anything...
- Where?
- Why do you just keep talking while...
- I didn't hear what...
- Why do you keep interrupting me?
- No, well...
- Did anything unusual happen...
- You kind of interrupted me a little bit.
- Just answer the...
- Just.
- Did anything unusual happen?
- Where?
What do you mean, where?
That's not a proper...
Yes or no?
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- Yeah.
- What?
- No.
- You said "yes" first.
"No" is what I ended with.
"Yes, no" means no.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
- And if so...
- Can you hold on one...
Can you hold on a second?
Yeah, it's me.
Can you stop what you're doing and come down here right away?
It's that thing that we talked about.
Yeah, well, you told me to call you if it came back, and it came back, so...
Okay.
What was that?
What's the thing?
You told someone the thing came back.
I have a rash on my back.
It came back, so I had to call my doctor.
You...
Miss!
- Yes?
- Me!
- What the...
What?
- Can you...
- Can I...
Yes.
- Follow you?
- To the...
- To my office.
- And then you'll tell me.
- Yeah.
What?
Did anything unusual...
What?
Jesus Christ!
Sorry, I wasn't...
We have a meeting in a couple minutes, so we just have to be quick.
Did anything unusual happen during my procedure?
What's he...
Can you please define "unusual"?
Out of the ordinary, bizarre, unanticipated.
No, this went well.
- It was good.
Okay, normal.
- Right.
Yes, good.
Well, the cessation maybe,
- but after that, you responded...
- The cessation of what?
Dr. Pincus, I really...
I don't need to tell you that every medical procedure doesn't follow the same path.
- Everyone's different.
- Yeah.
There are subtle variations in even the simplest surgical...
What would a subtle variation be in my case, for example?
- Well, one doesn't wish to use jargon.
- No.
- But, you know, technically...
- Yep.
...medically, it's beginning...
Okay.
Yeah.
- You died.
- I died?
- Little bit.
- For how long?
- Seven minutes.
- A bit less.
I died for seven minutes.
- A bit less.
- Approximately seven...
That's really the only thing that I can think of...
How did I die?
For the record, we did not recommend that you use the general anesthesia.
When you use anesthesia, there is a chance, although it is small, of a biochemical anomaly.
Where's the anesthesiologist?
I want to see him now.
He does not work here anymore.
You'll be happy to know that at Saint Victor's, we have a very strict three-strikes policy.
My anesthesiologist had two strikes?
Okay, let's all calm down.
Let's just not overdramatize the situation.
Why is he calming down?
Everybody dies.
Yeah, but usually at the end of their life, and just the once and forever.
Everybody's different.
And you weren't even gonna tell me.
- No, we did tell you.
We told you...
- No, you didn't.
We told you that night.
We gave you the full report.
- No, I don't remember that.
- Yes.
Yeah, we...
It says here that you gurgled to me before you rolled your eyes back in your head, a little bit.
Have you any idea how much I'm gonna sue you for?
- Nothing, I'm afraid.
- He's perked up.
Go on.
You signed a general release and a quitclaim form, relieving your surgeon, your anesthesiologist,
Saint Victor's Hospital and Cooperative Institutional Health Partners from any liability related to your anesthetic-induced cessation of heart function.
I definitely did not.
- Is this your signature at the bottom?
- When did I sign that?
Right after you passed the post-operative responsiveness test, legally mandated by the state of New York.
Obviously I didn't know what I was doing!
You knew enough to sign your name.
I dotted the "I" with a little love heart!
You were happy to be alive, right?
Now, about these hallucinations.
What are you seeing?
People.
Hey, got a sec?
Never get used to that.
You're the guy, huh?
No.
I'm not the guy.
It's another guy.
Go away.
Real quick, got to hit you up for a favor.
No, no, no, no.
No, he's still there.
Unbelievable.
- Thank you!
- Good, excellent.
Thank you!
Hey.
Wait a minute.
Wait, what?
- Drive!
